    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThis project proposes to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms within the nucleus accumbens (NAc)\ndriving cue-elicited reward seeking during aversion-resistant alcohol drinking (ARD), defined as drinking\ndespite negative consequences or \u201ccompulsive alcohol drinking\u201d, using optogenetics and simultaneous in-vivo\nelectrophysiology and optogenetics in male and female Long-Evans rats. Environmental reward predicting\ncues provide a source of motivation for reward-seeking which may be heightened following extended alcohol\nuse, resulting in maladaptive, ARD, a defining feature of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Despite the well-\nestablished role of the NAc in mediating cue-elicited reward seeking, motivation, and ARD, the neural signature\nwithin the NAc during cue and alcohol access in ARD is not known, which greatly limits prevention and\ntreatment of AUD. The NAc is innervated by glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular nucleus of the\nthalamus (PVT). This projection is thought to be relevant for processing motivational conflict and preventing\nunproductive reward seeking, while sparing normal affective behavior. However, the PVT-to-NAc pathway\u2019s\nrole in modulating NAc encoding during ARD or how the activity of PVT-to-NAc neurons alter ARD is not\nknown. Thus, the central hypotheses of this project are 1) the NAc encodes cue and outcome information\nrelated to ARD. Specifically, neural activity in the NAc responds to reward (alcohol access) predictive cues and\nto alcohol rewards in a discriminative stimulus task and that over continued alcohol use, this activity increases\nin correlation with the development of ARD and 2) the neuronal activity in the NAc is causally related to an\nexcitatory projection from the PVT that acts to prevent ARD initially, but erodes over time resulting in ARD. This\nproject will assess the neural mechanisms of cue-elicited reward seeking and ARD during a discriminative\nstimulus task using both optogenetic circuit manipulations and simultaneous optogenetics and awake-and-\nbehaving electrophysiology recordings. The training plan for this project is curated in an ideal research\nenvironment in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Minnesota which will provide training in\ncutting edge neuroscience techniques, professional development, and research ethics that will amass an ideal\ntraining experience to facilitate my career as an independent alcohol research scientist. The specific research\nhypotheses are 1) Optogenetic inhibition of PVT-to-NAc neurons at cue presentation and alcohol reward will\ncause ARD in otherwise aversion-sensitive rats. 2) Optogenetic excitation of PVT-to-NAc at cue presentation\nand alcohol reward will reduce ARD, causing aversion-sensitivity, in otherwise ARD rats. 3) Ensembles of\nneurons within the NAc encode cue and alcohol rewards during ARD. This encoding is facilitated by the PVT-\nto-NAc projection whereby PVT-to-NAc inhibition will increase NAc encoding of cues and alcohol rewards and\nPVT-to-NAc excitation will reduce this encoding within the NAc. Completion of the proposed work will elucidate\nunderstanding of the neural mechanisms of ARD and will aid in the prevention and treatment of AUD.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nType I interferons (IFN) are crucial to anti-viral immunity. Neutralizing autoantibodies (AAb) to IFN are found in\nthe general population, increase in prevalence with age, and are linked to worse, often fatal, outcomes in some\nof the most lethal acute respiratory viral diseases known to date, including fulminant influenza and COVID-19\npneumonia. Despite this, the mechanisms behind the formation of IFN AAb remain unknown.\nHuman data suggest that impairments in thymic tolerance\u2014due to dysfunction of autoimmune regulator (AIRE)\nand medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC)\u2014may be required for the development of IFN AAb. AIRE is a\ntranscription factor expressed by mTEC that is essential for establishing T cell tolerance in the thymus. In\nmTEC, AIRE promotes the expression and presentation of antigens from extrathymic tissues to developing T\ncells (thymocytes). This allows for the elimination of auto-reactive thymocyte clones, thereby preventing\nautoimmunity. Interestingly, AIRE+ mTEC have been shown to express IFN at steady-state conditions in the\nthymus suggesting that, in this context, AIRE+ mTEC act as antigen-presenting cells to thymocytes to mediate\nT cell tolerance to IFN. Supporting this idea, individuals with Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome 1 (APS1),\nwho lack AIRE and experience T cell tolerance loss, consistently develop IFN AAb. These AAb are isotype-\nswitched and somatically hypermutated, supporting the notion that a failure of T cell tolerance, rather than\nsolely B cell tolerance, is necessary for their generation. However, additional findings suggest that loss of\nthymic T cell tolerance alone is insufficient for IFN AAb to develop. First, APS1 patients do not typically present\nIFN AAb at birth or infancy; instead, they develop these AAb later in life after exposure to pathogens is likely to\nhave occurred. Second, IFN AAb have not been observed in specific pathogen-free, Aire-deficient mice.\nCombined, these observations suggest that pathogen exposure, in addition to AIRE and mTEC dysfunction,\nmay be required for IFN AAb to develop.\nThis proposal aims to understand how infections, combined with AIRE deficiency, contribute to the loss of\nthymic tolerance to IFN. My central hypothesis is that in individuals with predisposing AIRE deficiency,\ninfections that induce IFN expression act as a double hit, promoting the development of neutralizing IFN AAb.\nUntil now, methods to detect neutralizing IFN AAb in mice have been lacking, which has hindered the field's\nability to test this hypothesis. I have developed a novel, sensitive, reproducible, and high-throughput assay for\ndetecting murine neutralizing IFN AAb. This new tool will serve as the basis for this proposal and will facilitate\nexploration of how microbial infections and thymic defects contribute to the development of IFN AAb in an\nanimal model. The findings from this work will deepen our understanding of how tolerance to IFN is mediated\nand may inform strategies to prevent IFN AAb development in affected individuals.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is an epidemic, evident from its substantial global prevalence and burden,\nand is driving other major public health issues, including economic consequences. More than 30% of\nindividuals living with MDD demonstrate no response to two or more antidepressant interventions and\nultimately exhibit treatment resistance. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a safe,\nevidence-based, and non-invasive neuromodulation therapy for treatment-resistant depression. TMS utilizes\nelectromagnetic induction to create an electric current in the brain, depolarizing cortical neurons and eliciting\nneurophysiological and behavioral effects. TMS works by inducing neuroplasticity, both within the stimulated\ncortex and its broader connected networks. However, the current efficacy rate of TMS for MDD remains up to\n60%. This variability in treatment response may partially result from current clinical TMS approaches failing to\nincorporate the influence of brain dynamics at the time of stimulation on the neuroplastic effects and\ntherapeutic outcomes. In line with this notion, it may be possible to reliably improve TMS response by\nenhancing the TMS-induced neuroplasticity through synchronizing the stimulation with ongoing neural activity.\nAn oscillation-locked stimulation protocol delivers stimulation timed to a certain phase of an endogenous\nneural oscillation, which has been shown to modulate the ongoing brain activity in a more selective manner.\nSpecifically, oscillation-locked stimulation can reliably produce opposing neuroplastic outcomes of potentiation\nor depression, depending on whether a pulse occurs at a negative-going or positive-going phase of a local\noscillatory potential. Initial investigations and my Preliminary Data indicate that this effect is present in the\nhuman left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a critical hub in circuits governing cognitive and affective functions\nand the most common clinical TMS target. However, these findings have not been extensively examined, and\nthe impact of oscillation-locked TMS on neuroplasticity has not been fully delineated. I will aim to bridge this\nknowledge gap by elucidating how precise, oscillation-locked TMS induces local and network neuroplasticity\nand by examining how these effects vary across the spectrum of depressive severity. My central hypothesis is\nthat the phase of the ongoing oscillatory activity at the time of stimulation will differentially modulate both local\n(Aim 1) and network (Aim 2) neuroplasticity in adults without psychiatric diagnoses and those with MDD. This\nstudy will advance our theoretical understanding of clinically relevant neuroplasticity and investigate the\npotential of developing a brain state-dependent TMS protocol to effectively modulate relevant brain networks.\nIn addition to completing the proposed research study under the Kirschstein-NRSA Fellowship, I will pursue\nrigorous clinical and career development activities to fulfill the requirements for my MD and PhD degrees and\nestablish myself as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in neuromodulation.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary: The gradual loss of physical and cognitive ability has been taken as the near-universal\nconsequence of growing older. Older adults slow down physically, with reduced gait speed and increased\ninstability, and slow cognitively, with declining memory and executive function. Disease pathologies can\naccelerate these declines and are the focus of most aging research. Nonetheless, exceptions to these\ntrajectories can be identified, most notably cognitive \u201cSuperAgers,\u201d who retain the working memory of people\n30 years younger. Initial research on SuperAgers has focused only on cognition studied through static, MR-\nbased neuroimaging and cytoarchitectural examination of post-mortem brains. However, as mounting evidence\ndemonstrates fast movement is a distinguishing feature of health and longevity in older adults, our research\nemphasizes the dynamic interaction between brain neural and vascular function during physical movement.\nOur preliminary data illustrate that older adults age 75+ years with exceptionally fast walking speeds and who\nare free of cognitive decline \u2013 who we have termed fast-moving SuperAgers - display a robust capacity for\nneuroplasticity induction (measured with electroencephalography (EEG)) and remarkably high cerebral blood\nflow (measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD)) during whole-body behavioral learning. Motivated\nby these captivating data, this DP2 project will test the novel hypothesis that fast-moving SuperAgers are\nenriched in unique neuroplasticity and cerebrovascular profiles that are neuroprotective and enable remarkably\nhigh physical and cognitive function as they near or enter their 9th and 10th decade.\nThis project embraces a systems-neuroscience perspective to study neuroplasticity induction and interactions\nwith real-time cerebrovascular function in the unique aging phenotype of fast-moving SuperAgers. We utilize a\nhighly innovative, multimodal approach (EEG, biomechanics, TCD) to quantify the adaptation of cortical and\nbiomechanical responses to repeated standing balance perturbations. We synergistically assess real-time\ncerebral blood flow velocity during this balance learning task and interactions with cortical plasticity induction.\nWe will compare the state and longitudinal trajectory of neuroplasticity and cerebrovascular function in fast-\nmoving SuperAgers to their normally- and slow-moving peers under the same learning conditions. These\nresults could identify key functional neuroprotective mechanisms of brain aging to be leveraged and targeted\nwith future interventions to prevent decline of cognition and physical function. The development of targeted,\nphysiologically-informed interventions through a lens of brain resilience for neurodegenerative diseases such\nas dementia would be especially impactful because current pathology-focused treatments (e.g. anti-amyloid\ndrugs) are extremely limited. Findings gleaned through our innovative conceptual and technical approach to\nstudy human aging neurobiology could pave the way towards a new resilience-focused framework, enabling us\nto make impactful scientific discoveries to improve the lives of aging Americans.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nProject Title: Expanding Low-Barrier Buprenorphine Initiation and Post-Discharge Engagement in\nEmergency and Prehospital Settings\nBackground: The opioid crisis continues to pose a significant public health challenge, with opioid-\nrelated overdose stubbornly high across the U.S. despite the availability of evidence-based treatment\noptions. Emergency departments (EDs) and emergency medical services (EMS) serve as critical\nintervention points for patients experiencing opioid-related crises. However, despite strong evidence\nsupporting ED-initiated medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), implementation remains limited\ndue to provider hesitancy, institutional barriers, and gaps in post-discharge care. This project seeks to\naddress these challenges by integrating structured, high-dose buprenorphine induction across EMS\nand ED settings while ensuring sustained post-discharge engagement through a multidisciplinary\nmobile outreach team.\nObjectives: This study will evaluate the impact of a structured MOUD expansion model that spans\nprehospital, acute care, and community settings. The primary objectives are to:\n1. Increase buprenorphine administration in ED and EMS settings to improve rapid access to MOUD.\n2. Enhance provider adoption of high-dose buprenorphine induction protocols through structured\ntraining and technical assistance.\n3. Improve patient retention at 7-day and 30-day post-discharge intervals via proactive mobile\noutreach and linkage to outpatient treatment.\n4. Decrease overall ED utilization among patients receiving buprenorphine, reducing avoidable\nhealthcare encounters and hospital burden.\nMethods: This study employs a mixed-methods evaluation framework, integrating both quantitative\nand qualitative assessments. Electronic health records (EHRs) will track buprenorphine\nadministration rates, help monitor retention in treatment, and measure changes to ED utilization and\nhospital re-admissions. Provider surveys and structured interviews will assess confidence and\nknowledge in high-dose induction protocols. The ED-IMAT tool will systematically evaluate\ninstitutional readiness, training gaps, and care linkage challenges. Qualitative insights from Extension\nfor Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) sessions will further inform implementation barriers\nand real-time adaptation strategies.\nSignificance: By embedding a sustainable, data-driven MOUD expansion model within acute and\nprehospital care settings, this initiative directly supports Healthy People 2030 objectives to increase\nthe proportion of individuals receiving MOUD and reduce opioid-related mortality. Findings will\ncontribute to national efforts to scale ED and EMS-based addiction treatment, inform state and\nmunicipal policy, and establish a replicable framework for integrating MOUD into emergency care\nworkflows.\nImpact: This project aims to transform opioid overdose response by shifting from a reactive to a\nproactive, patient-centered model of care. Through structured capacity-building, real-time technical\nassistance, and post-discharge navigation, this initiative will optimize MOUD retention, improve health\noutcomes, and reduce opioid-related harms at the population level.",
