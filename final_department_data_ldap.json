    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Aging is a fundamental driver of many chronic conditions, including obesity, type II diabetes and\nmetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly known as fatty liver disease).\nNumerous aging-related pathologies are promoted by overnutrition and are associated with dysregulation of\nkey metabolic pathways, particularly those related to lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. We have\npreviously found that the cell cycle protein cyclin D1 is induced in hepatocytes in response to feeding and\novernutrition, and that it unexpectedly regulates key metabolic pathways in the liver, independently of its role in\nproliferation. In particular, we find that cyclin D1 represses several steps of lipid catabolism, which play an\nimportant role in health and lifespan. We now find that cyclin D1 increases with age in hepatocytes of mice and\nhumans, suggesting a link between cyclin D1 and age-related metabolic dysfunction. However, the\nmechanisms by which age and overnutrition promote cell cycle-independent expression of cyclin D1 have not\nbeen defined. In addition, we have significant gaps in our understanding of how this protein modulates\ndownstream metabolic events.\n Using the nematode C. elegans, we have established that the links between cyclin D1 and repression\nof lipid catabolism are fundamental biological responses conserved between species. Using the auxin-induced\ndegron (AID) system, we have developed a new genetic tool in C. elegans that allows visualization of the worm\northolog of cyclin D1, encoded by the cyd-1 gene, as well as a means of reducing expression in a temporal and\nspatial manner. Preliminary studies indicate that genetic manipulation of cyclin D1/CYD-1 alters lipid\nmetabolism in the worm and targets pathways involved in lipid catabolism. We will now use this powerful\ngenetic model system as a discovery platform to define the mechanisms by which cyclin D1/CYD-1 influences\nlipid metabolism, aging and age-related metabolic dysfunction.\n Our proposed studies will establish a mechanistic foundation for further translational work, focusing on\nidentifying strategies to inhibit cyclin D1 expression or manipulate its downstream targets as therapeutic\napproaches to combat age-related metabolic dysfunction.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nIslet transplantation is a promising treatment for insulin-dependent forms of diabetes, including type 1 diabetes\nand surgical diabetes induced by total pancreatectomy. In the U.S., total pancreatectomy with islet\nautotransplantation (TPIAT)\u2014which is performed to relieve pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis-- has been\nthe most prevalent form of islet transplant to date. At the same time, islet allotransplantation for type 1\ndiabetes is growing, and will continue to grow with the success of stem-cell derived islets and future\napproaches to reduce immunosuppression risks via technological advancements, genetic editing, or newer\nimmunomodulation. Islet autotransplant is a useful research model to study adjunctive therapies for glycemic\ncontrol and islet graft survival because it is free of the confounding factors of alloimmune rejection and\nrecurrent type 1 diabetes. In TPIAT, about 70% of patients require exogenous insulin despite having some\nendogenous islet function, and attrition of islet function over time occurs in both auto and allografts. This\nattrition appears to be at least in part driven by metabolic stress on the transplanted beta cells.\nThis pilot clinical trial, submitted in response to PAS-25-102, is designed to gather preliminary data on the\nefficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy (SGLT2i) in islet autotransplant recipients who have partial islet\nfunction. Our rationale for studying SGLT2i in this population is: (1) SGLT2i reduces blood glucose levels\nthrough increased glucosuria and do not directly stimulate islets (avoiding extra metabolic stress), nor does the\nbenefit depend on presence of insulin resistance, which is often absent in islet transplant; (2) in both T1D and\ntotal pancreatectomy, there is evidence of reduced prandial glucose excursions with SGLT2i, which in turn may\nreduce metabolic beta-cell stress on transplanted islets in TPIAT; (3) SGLT2i are acceptable to patients as a\nonce-daily oral medication. However, safety of these agents is unknown in TPIAT, and in theory they may\nincrease risk for diabetic ketoacidosis in this population of patients who have partial insulin deficiency.\nWe will enroll 30 patients with partial islet function >1 year after TPIAT, randomized to a standard care control\narm (n=10) or one of 2 doses of empagliflozin (n=10 on 10 mg; n=10 on 25 mg) for 3 months, followed by a 3\nmonth extension during which all patients will receive empagliflozin (25 mg daily). Specific Aim 1 will\ndetermine if empagliflozin improves glycemic control and reduces beta-cell specific endoplasmic reticulum\nstress after islet autotransplant. Specific Aim 2 will assess safety and feasibility of empagliflozin in islet\nautotransplant recipients. If results from this pilot study are promising, we will conduct a larger randomized\nblinded study. PI Bellin has led two multicenter TPIAT studies and has relationships with other centers to build\na larger randomized trial. Importantly, we expect that results from this study will also inform the field of islet\nallotransplant for type 1 diabetes.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nChronic pancreatitis (CP) is an often painful and disabling condition with few treatment options. For those with\npain and impaired quality-of-life (QoL) who have failed medical and endoscopic therapies, complete removal of\nthe pancreas may be considered with a procedure called total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant (TPIAT).\nFor many patients, TPIAT can be life-changing, with meaningful pain reduction. However, up to 20% have\nsignificant persistent pain after TPIAT. We lack objective measures to predict who will respond to TPIAT. In\nthose who do respond, it is presumed that the pain is resolved simply because the pancreatectomy has removed\nthe visceral source of pain, while non-responders have more complex pain syndromes involving changes in the\ncentral nervous system. Complementary work by our group in CP (without TPIAT) suggests that plasma or\nurinary biomarkers may distinguish pain phenotypes.\nThe current proposal will leverage the largest TPIAT database and biorepository from a multicenter study of\npatients undergoing TPIAT (POST study) to develop biomarkers that predict response to TPIAT. Of note: Dr. M.\nBellin, the PI of the POST study, is also PI on this application. In the NIDDK-funded POST study, over 400\nenrolled participants underwent TPIAT, with detailed phenotyping for pain and QoL before and 1 year after TPIAT.\nIn addition, biospecimens including plasma and urine were collected before TPIAT in all consenting participants\n(n=384) and 1 year after TPIAT in a subset (n=183) with in-person follow up. Based on preliminary data from our\nand other labs, we hypothesize that a set of objective biomarkers from blood and/or urine can distinguish\nthose who benefit from TPIAT (pain reduction/relief) from those who respond poorly.\nThis clinical question is particularly important because TPIAT is a major, costly intervention with irreversible\nlifelong health implications. In SA 1, we will identify plasma biomarkers collected before TPIAT that predict\npersistent pain after TPIAT using samples and data from POST. Samples will be divided into FDA-compliant\ndiscovery and validation groups. Pain response to TPIAT will be defined by opioid use and pain scores at 1 year.\nSecondary measures for QoL and pain interference with daily function will also be assessed. In SA 2, we will\nuse the same approach to identify pre-TPIAT urine biomarkers that predict persistent pain after TPIAT. In SA 3,\nwe will assess change in biomarkers from pre-TPIAT to 1 year using plasma and urine biomarkers validated in\nSA 1/2 (SA 3a) and also using a discovery and validation approach to identify additional plasma and urine\nbiomarkers that may have distinct patterns over time in patients with vs. without persistent pain (SA 3b).\nIdentifying plasma and urinary biomarkers will improve TPIAT patient selection, reducing negative impact on\npatients and health care infrastructure. Data from this study will identify biomarkers that can also be investigated\nin the larger populations with CP and other pain syndromes.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nTotal pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant (TPIAT) is performed to treat the severe, intractable pain of\nchronic pancreatitis for patients who have failed medical or endoscopic therapies. The TP relieves the source\nof pain, while the IAT reduces risk or severity of post-operative diabetes; after 1 year, up to 40% of patients are\noff insulin and nearly 90% have islet function (C-peptide positive). However, little is known about the long-term\nfunction of the islet graft. Rigorous studies are needed to determine what proportion of patients maintain islet\nfunction long term and whether islet function improves glycemic control and reduces diabetes complications in\nthis population. This carries high potential for impact in clinical care: currently some patients are denied\ncoverage for IAT due to lack of rigorous studies establishing the benefit of IAT. Furthermore, we know little\nabout how changes in gut anatomy and associated hormones (GLP-1) and alpha cell dysregulation (glucagon)\nof intraportally transplanted islets impact long-term glycemic regulation. Hypoglycemia has been increasingly\nreported after TPIAT, with exaggerated incretin response and/or defective glucagon counterregulation\nsuggested as possible mechanisms.\nWe propose to study islet function, glycemic control, diabetes complications, and mechanisms impacting\nglycemic control (incretin hormone axis, counterregulatory hormones) in patients who are 5-20 years out from\nTPIAT. The study\u2019s overall aim is to determine the long-term benefit of IAT. To assess islet graft function, we\nwill use C-peptide levels from mixed meal tolerance testing (MMTT) as the marker of endogenous islet\nfunction. We will enroll at least 200 participants in this cross-sectional study, who are 5-20 years after TPIAT\nfor chronic or recurrent acute pancreatitis. The study's first aim is to determine the proportion of patients who\nmaintain islet graft function 5-20 years after TPIAT and to determine whether C-peptide levels from a MMTT\nare associated with concurrent glycemic control measures. The second aim is to determine whether islet graft\nfunction is inversely associated with diabetes-specific complications (severe hypoglycemia, diabetic\nketoacidosis, and micro- or macrovascular disease). The third aim is to determine other mechanisms that\nimpact long-term glycemic control in TPIAT, including incretin function, alpha cell function, and markers of beta\ncell stress. As an exploratory aim we will recruit a subgroup of patients who are 5-20 years out from TP alone\nto undergo the same testing protocol for comparison with TPIAT recipients without and with graft function. This\nstudy's significance lies in its potential to directly impact clinical care and access to IAT when TP is needed.\nWe hypothesize that islet graft function improves glycemic control and reduces diabetes complications even in\nrecipients who are not insulin-independent, but that dysfunctional incretin and counter-regulatory responses\nwill impact hypoglycemia risk.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) occurring after one or more episodes of acute pancreatitis (AP) is an important cause\nof DM in adults, affecting about 15% of individuals by 2 years after an episode of AP. However, more rigorous\ndata are needed in larger and more diverse populations to define the exact incidence of new DM, risk factors\nfor developing DM, and pathophysiological mechanisms driving AP-related DM. To address this research gap,\nthe National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) formed the \u201cType 1 Diabetes\nAcute Pancreatitis Consortium\u201d (T1DAPC) in 2020, which subsequently launched the Diabetes Related to\nAcute Pancreatitis and its Mechanisms (DREAM) study in 2022. The primary aims of the DREAM study are to\nestimate the prevalence of and clinical risk factors for DM after AP, characterize islet function and endocrine\ndysfunction after AP, and understand potential immunologic drivers of DM after AP. The University of\nMinnesota has been a successful clinical site in the T1DAPC, as evidenced by: (1) strong recruitment\nand exceptional retention (>95%) in DREAM; (2) leadership in the consortium including Co-Chairing the\nconsortium and DREAM protocol (contact P.I. Bellin); and (3) proposals and contributions for ancillary studies\nand secondary data analyses. We will continue this important work in the next funding cycle of the T1DAPC.\nOur site-specific Aims for this proposal are:\n (1) To recruit and retain participants in the DREAM trial and to maintain academic engagement,\ncollaboration, and leadership within the T1DAPC. We will continue to achieve a high level of participant\n engagement and retention in the DREAM study.\n(2) To determine whether CT-derived abdominal and pancreatic fat measures predict future development of\n DM and decline in beta cell function. We will use innovative machine learning approaches to estimate\n pancreatic, visceral and subcutaneous fat in the DREAM participants on initial CT imaging and\n determine its value in predicting later DM and beta cell function.\n(3) To define the role of beta cell function and insulin resistance in DM development after AP. We will use\n metabolic testing data collected in DREAM to determine metabolic pathways (reduced insulin secretion\n and/or insulin resistance) driving DM development.\nThe results of DREAM will have a high impact in the clinical care of patients with AP, and are a first step\ntowards developing screening, treatment, and ultimately prevention strategies for AP-related DM.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Maintaining healthy adipose tissue function is essential for metabolic homeostasis and the prevention\nof metabolic diseases. As potent endocrine cells, adipocytes secret various bioactive molecules and\nextracellular vesicles that influence the function of tissues and organs throughout the body. Besides\nadipocytes, multipotent stem and progenitor cells in adipose tissue are crucial for tissue maintenance\nand repair throughout life. With aging, adipose tissue undergoes species-conserved changes, including\ndecreased subcutaneous adiposity, increased visceral adiposity, and a decline in the thermogenic\ncapacity of brown and beige adipose tissue. In contrast to the detrimental effects of adipocyte\nhypertrophy, hyperplasia, a process known as adipogenesis, supports tissue development, repair, and\nmetabolic health. However, adipogenesis is impaired during aging, which has been linked to adipose\nprogenitor cell senescence, potentially contributing to the development of metabolic diseases. Recent\nstudies indicate that extracellular vehicles (EVs), particularly adipocyte-derived EVs (Ad-EVs) play a role\nin intercellular communication within adipose tissue, regulating its function. Ad-EVs exhibit heterogeneity,\nwith large and small Ad-EVs differing in protein and lipid composition, suggesting functional diversity.\nHowever, the specific subtypes of Ad-EVs secreted by adipocytes and their distinct roles in local and\nsystemic metabolic regulation remain unexplored. Our preliminary studies indicate that Lipocalin 2\n(LCN2), a novel phosphatidic acid (PA) binding protein, plays a potential role in senescence and\nadipogenesis of adipose stem and progenitor cells (ASPCs) through EV-mediated intercellular\ncommunication. Lcn2 deficiency impairs adipogenesis and results in hypertrophic obesity. Stromal-\nvascular (SV) cells from the brown and white adipose tissue of Lcn2 knockout mice exhibit increased\nsenescence and decreased adipogenesis. Importantly, we have identified LCN2 in a distinct\nsubpopulation of Ad-EVs that is separate from adiponectin-containing Ad-EVs. In this proposal, we aim\nto characterize the cargo composition and function of LCN2-containing EVs (LCN2+EVs) released from\nadipocytes, examining their role in ASPC senescence and adipogenesis during aging. We hypothesize\nthat adipocyte-derived LCN2+EVs possess anti-senescence properties that maintain ASPC health and\nadipogenic capacity through adipocyte-to-ASPC communication within adipose tissue, and this effect is\ncontext-dependent. We propose two aims to characterize the cargo composition of LCN2+EVs released\nfrom adipocytes upon metabolic and inflammatory stress, and 2) determine the role of adipocyte-derived\nLCN2+EVs in ASPC senescence and adipogenesis during aging. The project outcomes are expect to\nprovide new perspectives on the pathogenesis of aging-related metabolic disorders and pave the way for\ndeveloping new therapeutic strategies targeting adipose tissue function.",

Census-derived measures of family SES were reported by participants\u2019 parents.\nUsing full-count Census data, we will also construct aggregate measures of SES in participants\u2019 childhood\nneighborhoods. (Aim 2) Investigate the relationship between childhood Pb exposure and incident ADRD and\nbiomarkers of neuropathology. We will accomplish this by using historic data on Pb exposure through water\n(Pb plumbing and water acidity), Pb gasoline (automotive and aviation) and Pb mines and smelters. (Aim 3)\nExamine whether childhood SES modifies the association between Pb exposure and incident ADRD. (Aim 4)\nCreate infrastructure for future explorations using census-linked ARIC-NCS data. This Aim will support the\nsecure, efficient, and reproducible use of these novel early-life data for future investigations by the broader\nresearch community. This project is innovative because it will rely on contemporaneous rather than\nretrospective measurement of childhood circumstances, evaluate incident ADRD in a diverse population, and\nprovide etiologic insights using the deeply phenotyped ARIC-NCS data. The proposed research is significant\nbecause it will consequentially improve our understanding of the connections between early-life socioeconomic\ndisadvantage, Pb exposure, and ADRD risk in late-life, which may inform policy and future interventions.",

    "abstract_text": "The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study was initiated in 1985 with two components: community-based surveillance and a prospective cohort study. The community surveillance aimed to monitor trends in hospitalized myocardial infarction (MI), fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) in four U.S. communities: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. Surveillance for hospitalized heart failure (HF) events was added in 2005. The communities were selected to provide data across four (4) geographic locations with a range of mortality rates, in urban, suburban, and rural settings. The cohort study aimed to investigate the risk factors for and natural history of atherosclerosis and development of clinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged white or African American adults from the same communities. The study recruited in 15,792 white or African American participants initially aged 45-64 years and selected participants received triennial clinical exams over the first ten years of the study (1987-1989, 1990-1992, 1993-1995, and 1996-1998). The clinical exam in 2011-13 was conducted on over 6,500 participants 69-89 years with a focus on characterizing heart failure stages in community-dwelling participants and enabling identification of genetic and environmental factors leading to ventricular dysfunction and vascular stiffness. These data provided the basis for several ancillary studies covering a breadth of topics. The clinical exam in 2018-19 on almost 3,600 participants 75 years and older supported exam components from 12 NIH grant-funded ancillary studies on topics including progression of Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF), coronary artery calcification, atrial fibrillation burden detected by novel continuous ECG monitoring technology, diabetes, dementia, brain amyloid deposition, and changes in arterial stiffness and cognition. Participation of the surviving cohort was 91, 82, 74, 65, and 50% at each of the respective follow-up examinations. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other \u2013omics investigations. Since baseline, cohort members have also been contacted every 12 months (and every 6 months since 2012) to obtain information on vital status, current residence, major illness or injury, and hospitalizations occurring between contacts to identify clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Cohort contact was 78% at the last completed follow-up period. Findings have been presented in over 2,600 publications as of 2021.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY\nThis application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Pamela Lutsey, with protected time and other\nsupport to 1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior clinical investigators and graduate students\nengaged in cardiovascular disease (CVD) patient-oriented research (POR), 2) obtain additional training in\npharmacoepidemiology, -omics and mentoring best practices and 3) advance her ongoing CVD\npharmacoepidemiology research program. Pharmaceuticals play a crucial role in the prevention and treatment\nof CVD and other conditions. To improve the effectiveness of pharmacologic interventions on CVD outcomes,\nwe need junior clinical investigators conducting POR who have rigorous training and mentorship in the areas\nof pharmacoepidemiology, clinical epidemiology of CVD, translational research methods and the use of\ncomplex data sources. An expert in these areas, the candidate, Dr. Lutsey, proposes to apply K24 funds\ntoward the mentorship of POR scholars at the University of Minnesota who are committed to a research\ncareer that will reduce the burden of CVD in the population through building rigorous evidence regarding how\nto optimize use of pharmaceuticals in order to prevent CVD in at-risk populations and reduce risk of\nrecurrence among individuals with CVD. Aim 1 involves conducting pharmacoepidemiology POR comparative\neffectiveness research to prevent CVD in at-risk populations and improve the outcomes among CVD\nsurvivors. State-of-the-art pharmacoepidemiologic techniques will be applied to large administrative data\nsources, specifically MarketScan and the Medicare 20% sample. Aim 2 will harness rich data from deeply\nphenotyped cohorts to understand behavioral characteristics that influence the effectiveness of medications,\nand glean added understanding of the physiologic mechanisms through which pharmacotherapies act. These\nanalyses will use data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and the Multi-Ethnic Study\nof Atherosclerosis (MESA). Findings from the proposed Aims will advance understanding of the role of specific\npharmacologic treatment strategies on CVD risk, and have potential to directly impact clinical practice,\nreinforcing or leading to reconsideration of existing clinical guidelines. This proposal is structured to allow\ntrainees the flexibility to pursue their own hypotheses, motivated by their clinical experiences and interests.\nWith support from this K24, Dr. Lutsey plans to expand the breadth of her POR research activities, recruit new\njunior clinical scholars into POR, and prepare them to make major scientific advances and launch their own\nindependent research careers.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nTo increase smoking cessation rates from the status quo (7.4% of people who smoke [PWS] quit smoking\neach year in the U.S.) and curb cancer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering the\nimplementation of two cigarette product standards. The first is the FDA\u2019s proposed menthol ban (MB). The\nsecond is a nicotine reduction standard (NRS). Based on published literature encompassing modeling studies,\nbehavioral intent estimates, and expert elicitation, as well as our team\u2019s preliminary data, the MB is anticipated\nto motivate 7.3% to 17.7% of PWS menthol cigarettes to quit and the NRS is anticipated to motivate 46.8% to\n57.5% of all PWS to quit. These levels of quitting above the status quo will mean that quitlines and other state-\nbased cessation initiatives will be severely under-resourced to meet the needs of PWS. Our research is thus\nhighly significant as our overarching objective is to ensure that the U.S. is fully prepared to maximize smoking\ncessation during and following the implementation of cigarette product standards by providing state\ndepartments of health, tobacco quitline operators, as well as state policy and law makers, with state-specific\nestimates of the number of PWS who will quit smoking in response to cigarette standards and the number of\nquitline enrollees. We will also provide state-specific estimates for populations at higher risk for tobacco-related\ndisease and death which can be leveraged to purposively plan for equitable resource distribution. Additionally,\nthe added benefit of mass media campaigns, which will likely be used to introduce the cigarette standards and\npromote smoking cessation and cessation resources, will be forecasted. A constituent advisory council (CAC)\ncomprised of state public health professionals and representatives of national non-profits and advocacy\norganizations with interests in tobacco control will guide our efforts and help ensure that end users of the\nestimates understand the methods, assumptions, and limitations while providing opportunities to maximize the\nutility of the estimates. The aims of this three-year project are as follow: Aim 1: To estimate, for each U.S.\nstate, the number of and fold increase in PWS, both overall and in priority populations, who will quit smoking\nand enroll in the quitline in the year following the MB and the NRS. Aim 2: To estimate the added number of\nPWS who would quit and enroll into quitlines if mass media campaigns are implemented alongside the MB and\nthe NRS for each state and in priority populations. Aim 3: To conduct a constituent-centered design process,\ninvolving CAC inputs and usability assessments to inform the development of a public portal for disseminating\nthe estimates. Our research is consistent with the NCI\u2019s Tobacco Control Research Branch scientific priorities\nincluding research on \u201ctobacco cessation interventions at individual, system, and population levels\u201d and\n\u201ctobacco control interventions for underserved and at-risk populations.\u201d It is aligned with the recently released\nDepartment of Health and Human Services draft cessation framework which will be a roadmap to \u201cdrive further\nprogress toward smoking cessation and to deliver equitable outcomes for all persons in America.\u201d",

    "abstract_text": "While American Indian (AI) persons have historically used wild or homegrown tobacco for spiritual purposes,\nthe use of commercially produced tobacco has risen dramatically. Today, smoking-related cancers are as much\nas three fold higher among AI persons than White persons. Our preliminary data show that the odds of quitting\nsmoking among AI persons are 40% lower than White persons. Low engagement with smoking cessation\ninterventions is considered a major contributor to the disparity in cessation. NCI\u2019s Smokefree program provides a\nsuite of evidence-based digital resources for smoking cessation, including a website (Smokefree.gov), text\nprogram (Smokefree TXT), smartphone app (QuitGuide), and social media (Smokefree Facebook). These\nresources facilitate interaction with one another, have wide reach, and have been shown to increase cessation\nin the general population. However, we posit that Smokefree does not meet the needs and cultures of AI\npersons and is unlikely to engage and maximize cessation in AI persons. For this reason, through engagement\nwith tribes and AI-serving clinics and nationally drawn community advisory boards, our team has conducted\npreliminary studies to develop Smokefree TXT for Natives and QuitGuide for Natives. Our team also maintains\na social media page, Quit Connections, to provide a community for AI persons during their quit journey. These\nculturally aligned resources incorporate Indigenous worldviews and strengths, respect tobacco for spiritual\npurposes, integrate smoking triggers such as grief that are common to AI persons, and promote healing\nthrough culture and community connectedness as part of the quit journey. Our next step is to determine to\nwhat extent these culturally aligned resources, when packaged as Smokefree for Natives and supplemented\nwith a culturally aligned Smokefree.gov, increase smoking cessation among AI persons. Our central\nhypothesis is that in AI persons who smoke (PWS) Smokefree for Natives will yield greater smoking\nabstinence versus the non-tailored Smokefree. This proposal builds on longstanding collaborations and\nemploys mixed methodologies including Indigenous practices in engagement, a rigorous clinical trial, and\nqualitative interviews. The aims are: Aim 1: To co-create a website, Smokefree.gov for Natives, which will\nserve as the landing page for AI-aligned online cessation treatment content and facilitate access to a suite of\nculturally aligned digital cessation resources for AI persons; Aim 2: To test the efficacy of Smokefree for\nNatives via a remotely conducted randomized controlled trial among American Indian PWS (n=416); Aim 3: To\nqualitatively assess perceptions of Smokefree for Natives among AI PWS (n=40) and thematic differences in\nresponse based on demographics and geography. This proposal represents the braiding together of\nIndigenous and Western research approaches and represents a logical progression of our engagement efforts\nto date. Given that AI persons experience one of the most extreme smoking disparities, a scalable and\nculturally aligned smoking cessation intervention for AI persons could have considerable public health impact.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nDespite advances in treatment options, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-related\ndeaths in women. Identifying key signaling pathways that drive breast cancer progression is necessary for\ndeveloping new approaches to target breast cancer. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors\n(FGFR) are activated in human breast cancers across subtypes and contribute to breast cancer progression\nvia both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. The focus of this proposal is to define identify novel\nmechanisms through which FGFR activation in breast cancer cells contributes to pro-tumorigenic alterations\nin the tumor microenvironment, which contribute to breast cancer progression. To this end, we have focused\non identifying 1) novel transcriptional targets of FGF/FGFR signaling in breast cancer cells and 2) their\nimpact on the stromal environment. Using a model of FGFR-driven mammary tumor growth and progression,\nwe have generate preliminary data that link FGF/FGFR activation in tumor cells with de novo cholesterol\nsynthesis and accumulation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that cholesterol accumulation in tumor cells\npromotes the generation of an immunosuppressive macrophage population. Although the FGF/FGFR axis\nhas been shown to regulate metabolic functions in some physiological contexts, the link between FGF/FGFR\nand cholesterol metabolism has not been investigated in the cancer. The studies described in this proposal\nwill test the hypothesis that activation of FGFR in breast cancer cells drives cholesterol metabolism in tumor\ncells and that these alterations contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Studies proposed in\nSpecific Aim 1 will the mechanisms by which FGF/FGFR activation in breast cancer cells drives cholesterol\naccumulation and storage. Studies in Specific Aim 2 will examine the impact of FGFR-driven cholesterol\nmetabolism on the tumor microenvironment. Finally, studies in Specific Aim 3 will use spatial transcriptomics\nand multiplex imaging techniques to identify links between FGF/FGFR and cholesterol metabolism in human\nbreast cancers. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to FGFR-driven alterations in cholesterol\nmetabolism in tumor cells and subsequent impacts on the tumor microenvironment will lead to novel\ntherapeutic approaches that target malignant alterations within both the tumor cell and the stroma, leading to\nenhanced therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nNeurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and related dementias (ADRD) manifest with chronic inflammation\nand tau pathology. Passive immunotherapies have shown some success in clinical trials, but significant disease\nimprovement has not been achieved to date. The rapid advancement and clinical application of immune cell\nbased therapies in oncology has opened the door to developing innovative new cell therapies to treat\nneurodegeneration. Monocytes and derivative macrophages (M\u03a6) engineered with chimeric antigen receptors\n(CAR-M\u03a6) have emerged as a promising candidate for allogeneic cell-based cancer immunotherapy. M\u03a6 are\nunique from other immune cells in their capacity for tumor and tissue infiltration, and ability to phagocytosis\nextracellular entities including proteins, pathogens, and whole cells. The use of primary M\u03a6 derived from patient\nblood is challenging as these cells cannot be engineered and expanded ex vivo like T or NK cells, making\ncomplex genetic engineering maneuvers nearly impossible. We recently developed an optimized process for\nproduction of CAR M\u03a6 from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Human iPSC are amenable to\ncomplex genome engineering, and we have established a scalable process for production of genetically\nengineered M\u03a6 (iM\u03a6) for oncology applications. Here we propose redirecting our platform toward treatment of\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we will evaluate a curated list of novel iM\u03a6-specific CAR designs for\ntargeting the pathogenic Tau protein and evaluate their function using a battery of biochemical and in vitro\nassays. Additionally, as inflammation is a key contributor to AD pathology and also a potential risk associated\nwith transfer of immune cells to the central nervous system, we will pursue a two-pronged approach to address\nthese challenges. First, we will utilize multiplex base editing in iPSC to deactivate key inflammatory genes in\nderivative iM\u03a6, thus rendering them inert in their ability to instigate counterproductive inflammation.

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nNeurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and related dementias (ADRD) manifest with chronic inflammation\nand tau pathology. Passive immunotherapies have shown some success in clinical trials, but significant disease\nimprovement has not been achieved to date. The rapid advancement and clinical application of immune cell\nbased therapies in oncology has opened the door to developing innovative new cell therapies to treat\nneurodegeneration. Monocytes and derivative macrophages (M\u03a6) engineered with chimeric antigen receptors\n(CAR-M\u03a6) have emerged as a promising candidate for allogeneic cell-based cancer immunotherapy. M\u03a6 are\nunique from other immune cells in their capacity for tumor and tissue infiltration, and ability to phagocytosis\nextracellular entities including proteins, pathogens, and whole cells. The use of primary M\u03a6 derived from patient\nblood is challenging as these cells cannot be engineered and expanded ex vivo like T or NK cells, making\ncomplex genetic engineering maneuvers nearly impossible. We recently developed an optimized process for\nproduction of CAR M\u03a6 from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Human iPSC are amenable to\ncomplex genome engineering, and we have established a scalable process for production of genetically\nengineered M\u03a6 (iM\u03a6) for oncology applications. Here we propose redirecting our platform toward treatment of\nAlzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, we will evaluate a curated list of novel iM\u03a6-specific CAR designs for\ntargeting the pathogenic Tau protein and evaluate their function using a battery of biochemical and in vitro\nassays. Additionally, as inflammation is a key contributor to AD pathology and also a potential risk associated\nwith transfer of immune cells to the central nervous system, we will pursue a two-pronged approach to address\nthese challenges. First, we will utilize multiplex base editing in iPSC to deactivate key inflammatory genes in\nderivative iM\u03a6, thus rendering them inert in their ability to instigate counterproductive inflammation. Second, we\nwill incorporate a CAR activation-responsive genetic element in our vector that allows for selective production\nand secretion of our recently published high potency and high selectivity TNFR1 antagonist, thus achieving an\nadditional layer of inflammatory control specifically at the sites of Tau mediated inflammation.

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\n TDP43 is considered a key target for drug discovery in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis (ALS), and other TDP43 proteinopathies, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias (ADRD).\nThe pathophysiology of TDP43 proteinopathies involves a loss of native function (RNA binding and splicing\nregulation) and a toxic gain of function (cytoplasmic mislocalization and toxic aggregate formation). Despite years\nof research, current small molecule discovery efforts targeting TDP43 dysfunction have not yielded strong\ninhibitors or successful clinical translations.\n Historically, TDP43 therapeutic strategies have focused on reducing its toxic gain of function. Our proposal, in\ncontrast, aims to prevent the loss of TDP43\u2019s native function. Recent high-impact publications have provided\ncritical new insight into how we might accomplish this. It is now understood that TDP43\u2019s RNA binding requires\nN-terminal domain (NTD) multimerization, and that pathological loss of NTD-NTD interactions is the key step\npreceding cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation. The goal of this proposal is, therefore, to identify novel\nsmall molecules that stabilize functional, NTD-dependent TDP43 multimers to restore TDP43 function and\nrescue TDP43-associated pathologies. Our high-throughput screening pipeline, using engineered fluorescence\nlifetime (FLT)-based FRET biosensors, specifically monitors NTD-dependent TDP43 multimerization in living\ncells. We present strong and extensive preliminary data to support our proposal. A pilot screen of the 2,684\ncompound Selleck library identified multiple promising hits previously known to bind and effect TDP43. We\ndemonstrate the full pipeline on one of those hits, which stabilizes nuclear TDP43 multimers, rescues TDP43\nmislocalization and aggregation, improves neuronal cell health and partially rescues motor function in a C.\nelegans model of TDP43 proteinopathy. These data strongly support the premise of our targeting strategy, the\nrobustness of our HTS pipeline, and instill confidence in the promise of our proposed campaign.\n We will screen the 50,000-compound CNS-SetTM library, curated for BBB penetration, in an inducible neuronal\ncell line. Using a range of cell-based and biophysical assays we will identify two kinds of promising small\nmolecules that stabilize NTD-dependent multimers: 1) compounds that directly bind to the TDP43 NTD; or 2)\ncompounds that act through an indirect mechanism of action. To enrich the pool of direct acting compounds, we\nwill also perform in silico docking screens of over 500,000 compounds targeting the NTD-NTD dimeric interface.\nHit compounds from both screens will advance through the pipeline, which includes functional assays to monitor\nTDP43 splicing regulation, TDP43 mislocalization and aggregation, neurite length (a measure of cell health) in\nboth 2D neuronal culture and 3D neurospheres, and a C. elegans movement assay. Lastly, we will engineer\niPSC-derived motor neurons to express the TDP43 biosensors, providing an improved physiological model of\ndisease for future refinement of the most promising leads.",

These disorders include multiple cellular dysfunctions including impaired\nproteostasis (e.g., the dysregulation of the autophagy lysosomal pathway [ALP]). As preclinical disease models\nbecome more complex to better recapitulate disease relevant pathophysiology\u2014 i.e., monoculture \u2794 2D co-\nculture \u2794 3D organoids (both mono- and co-cultured) \u2794 in vivo \u2014 advanced multiplexing technologies that are\ncapable of dynamic temporal and spatial monitoring of protein-protein interactions (e.g., aSyn oligomerization\nand misfolding) and pathological phenotypes are required. Existing fluorescence-based biosensors are limited\nby their static nature and inability to differentiate signals across distinct cell types within multi-cellular\nenvironments. To address this, our proposal introduces Dark-FRET (DF) and Dual-Channel DF (DCDF) cellular\nbiosensors that utilize the Shadow-G/Y/R series of acceptor protein which were engineered as to have reduced\nquantum yield and negligible fluorescence emission, eliminating emission spillover from acceptor proteins which\nfacilitates improved live-cell multiplexing for multiple protein-protein interaction (PPI) fluorescence assays.\nThis cutting-edge approach enables real-time monitoring of both aSyn folding (ShadowY-aSyn-mNeongreen)\nand aggregation (aSyn-mScarlet-I3/ShadowR) FRET biosensors expressed in distinct cellular populations. We\nexpand on these capabilities by multiplexing the aSyn DCDF biosensors with our TFEB (the master regulator of\nALP), FRET and nuclear translocation biosensors. Aim 1 involves applying these biosensors to CNS-resident\ncell lines (neurons, microglia, astrocytes) to establish mono-, bi-, and tri-culture cellular models for dynamically\ntracking cell-specific aSyn interactions and ALP phenotype. Aim 2 extends DCDF technology to in vivo models\nusing novel C. elegans strains expressing aSyn DCDF and ALP biosensors in specific tissues. By enabling\nsimultaneous monitoring of aSyn oligomerization and phenotypic dysfunction, this approach provides a valuable\ntool for investigating synucleinopathies. Its potential applications extend to 3D organoids and hiPSC models,\noffering insights into diverse cell-type pathways and enabling the identification of compounds modulating aSyn\noligomerization and pathological phenotypes in these advanced preclinical models.\nIn summary, our DF/DCDF technology presents a groundbreaking approach, enabling dynamic monitoring of\naSyn aggregation and pathological phenotypes across complex disease models, paving the way to address\nbiological questions on the supporting roles of microglia and astrocytes on neuronal health and function.\nFurthermore, these multiplexed biosensors represent an innovative preclinical therapeutic discovery platform\nthat holds promise for enhancing the drug discovery process, potentially filling the therapeutic gap in\nsynucleinopathy treatment.",

The proposed study will modify an existing evidence-based parental\ntobacco cessation intervention (the Clinical Effort Against Secondhand Smoke Exposure, or CEASE) delivered\nin pediatric primary care clinics to address shared tobacco use determinants and barriers to smoking cessation\ntreatment among Somali Americans, an immigrant population facing significant combustible tobacco use\ndisparities. This new intervention, CEASE+, will increase access to and utilization of tobacco cessation\nresources for Somali parents. The goal of Aim 1 is 1a) to conduct focus groups with Somali parents who\nsmoke and non-smokers who live with adults who smoke to identify how to modify clinic-based parental\ntobacco cessation treatment within pediatric primary care and 1b) to use these results to modify CEASE\ncomponents and delivery to develop the new intervention, CEASE+. In Aim 2, we will conduct a pilot study of\nthe new intervention, CEASE+, to evaluate its feasibility and acceptability for Somali parents. The goal of Aim\n3 is to assess parent, clinician, and staff experiences with CEASE+ components and delivery strategies within\npediatric primary care clinics to inform future modifications. Ultimately, the completion of this study will provide\nfoundational data that will guide CEASE+ modifications for a future definitive test via a fully powered clinical\ntrial in Somali immigrant populations.

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a group of blood disorders diagnosed in nearly 15,000 Americans annually,\nare characterized by patients with high-risk MDS having a median survival of less than two years. Roughly half\nof all MDS patients possess a mutation in an RNA splicing factor (SF) gene: most commonly U2AF1, SRSF2, or\nSF3B1. Mutations in U2AF1 and SRSF2 are associated with faster disease progression to secondary acute\nmyeloid leukemia and with poorer patient outcomes. Complicating treatment, MDS-associated SF mutations are\nmutually exclusive and cause unique patterns of alternative splicing events with non-overlapping outcomes,\nbased on the individual mutations. Overcoming this, previous work in the Nguyen lab identified R loops, three-\nstranded RNA:DNA hybrid transcription intermediates, as a unifying mechanism of disease pathogenesis\ninduced by MDS-associated SF mutations. Recently, the lab further found that SF mutations sensitize cells to\ninhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, and that PARP1 plays a vital role in regulating R\nloops and maintaining genomic stability in SF-mutant cells. The proposed project aims to expand on this prior\nwork by elucidating the mechanism by which PARP2 regulates R loops in cells possessing MDS-associated SF\nmutations. Preliminary results show that PARP2 associates with R loops, and that loss of PARP2 leads to both\na reduction in ADP-ribosylation signaling in SF-mutant cells, and R-loop accumulation. In contrast, loss of PARP2\nhad no effect on ADP-ribosylation levels following direct DNA damage alone. PARP2 was also found to interact\nwith the R-loop-resolving helicase DDX41. The central hypothesis of this project is that PARP2 plays a unique\nrole at R loops to prevent R-loop-associated genomic instability in SF-mutant cells. This hypothesis will be tested\nthrough two specific aims evaluating PARP2 function at R loops: 1) elucidate how PARP2 senses R loops in\nU2AF1S34F cells, and 2) determine the impact of DDX41 ADP-ribosylation at R loops in SF-mutant cells. Results\nobtained through completion of these aims will provide new insights into how cells maintain genomic stability in\nresponse to R-loop accumulation, explicate a mechanism by which PARP inhibitors sensitize SF-mutant cells,\nand potentially identify novel biomarkers to predict this sensitivity. This proposal will be completed at the\nUniversity of Minnesota, under the co-mentorship of Dr. Hai Dang Nguyen, an expert in the DNA damage\nresponse, R-loop regulation, and hematologic disorders, and Dr. David Largaespada (co-sponsor), an expert in\nmolecular-genetic mechanisms of pathogenesis. To complement this expertise, I will receive further guidance\nfrom my collaborators: Dr. Stanley Lee, who specializes in mouse models of splicing-factor mutant MDS, and Dr.\nAnthony Leung, an expert in ADP-ribosylation signaling. This mentorship team, paired with the collaborative\nresearch environment, provides a unique opportunity for the candidate to complete the research aims described\nin this proposal and achieve his goal of becoming a molecular translational scientist working to uncover\nmechanisms of pathogenesis in hematologic disorders.",

Results\nobtained through completion of these aims will provide new insights into how cells maintain genomic stability in\nresponse to R-loop accumulation, explicate a mechanism by which PARP inhibitors sensitize SF-mutant cells,\nand potentially identify novel biomarkers to predict this sensitivity. This proposal will be completed at the\nUniversity of Minnesota, under the co-mentorship of Dr. Hai Dang Nguyen, an expert in the DNA damage\nresponse, R-loop regulation, and hematologic disorders, and Dr. David Largaespada (co-sponsor), an expert in\nmolecular-genetic mechanisms of pathogenesis. To complement this expertise, I will receive further guidance\nfrom my collaborators: Dr. Stanley Lee, who specializes in mouse models of splicing-factor mutant MDS, and Dr.\nAnthony Leung, an expert in ADP-ribosylation signaling. This mentorship team, paired with the collaborative\nresearch environment, provides a unique opportunity for the candidate to complete the research aims described\nin this proposal and achieve his goal of becoming a molecular translational scientist working to uncover\nmechanisms of pathogenesis in hematologic disorders.",

The long range goal and the\nclinical significance of this proposal are to use our newly engineered NKX2-5/TBX5/HAND2 knockout pigs as\nhosts ultimately for the production of personalized human hearts for clinical applications. The goal of the\ncurrent application is to establish a nonhuman primate platform in a pig that would provide the feasibility for\nengineering a humanized heart in a gene edited pig. Our previous publications demonstrate the rationale and\nfeasibility for our approach. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology, we have established that NKX2-\n5/TBX5/HAND2 mutant porcine embryos lack a heart and are lethal early during development. Using\nblastocyst complementation and SCNT we have further demonstrated that we can rescue the null phenotype\nand produce a viable chimeric pig with normal cardiac function. In these proposed studies, we will utilize a\nnumber of emerging technologies to engineer a paradigm shifting nonhuman primate heart in a genetically\nmodified porcine surrogate. To examine our hypotheses, we will address the following specific aims: Specific\nAim #1: To examine the capacity of GFP-labeled MHC mismatched porcine stem cells to rescue the\nporcine NKX2-5/TBX5/HAND2 null embryo; Specific Aim #2: To examine the capacity of interspecies\n(macaque iPSCs) stem cells to rescue the NKX2-5/TBX5/HAND2 null porcine host in vitro and Specific\nAim #3: To generate a macaque heart in the NKX2-5/TBX5/HAND2 null porcine host.

    "abstract_text": "Cardiovascular diseases are both common and deadly. For example, peripheral artery disease affects more\nthan 10M Americans resulting in more than 150,000 limb amputations each year in the U.S. In addition, more\nthan 300,000 patients have coronary artery bypass grafting (surgical revascularization). Current medical\ntherapies for vascular disease include limb amputation and vascular bypass grafting--these therapeutic\ninterventions have significant limitations. These diseases are chronic, debilitating, lethal and they warrant new\nand novel therapies. Previous studies have demonstrated the essential role for pioneer factors that modulate\nchromatin accessibility and thereby impact the binding of early transcriptional regulators for lineage\nspecification. We have recently demonstrated that ETV2 is an essential pioneer factor for endothelial, vascular\nand blood lineages. We have used global and conditional gene disruption strategies, fate-mapping, gene\nediting, single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq assays to provide supportive data for this application. In\naddition, we defined an important ETV2-miR130a-PDGFRa cascade that governs endothelial development.\nFurthermore, our recent publications and our preliminary data support the overall hypothesis that\nETV2 is a pioneer factor that regulates the specification of the endothelial lineage. In these proposed\nstudies, we will use a number of unique genetic models that we have engineered and we take an innovative\nstrategy to define the mechanisms whereby ETV2 functions as a pioneer factor to regulate cardiovascular\nregeneration. To examine our hypotheses, we will address the following specific aims: Specific Aim #1:\nSpecific Aim #1: To further define the mechanisms whereby ETV2 functions as a pioneer factor during\nembryogenesis and reprogramming to the endothelial lineage; Specific Aim #2: To define the role of\nchromatin modifying factors and ETV2 during embryogenesis and reprogramming to the endothelial\nlineage and Specific Aim #3: To examine the factors that promote ETV2 mediated reprogramming of\nthe endothelial lineage in vitro and in vivo. These aims will utilize our recently engineered genetic mouse\nmodels, ATAC-seq, MNase-seq, ChIP-seq, inducible mouse model, cardiac injury model in the adult mouse,\nnovel and bioinformatics algorithms to comprehensively define the mechanisms whereby ETV2 functions as a\npioneer factor and will serve as prelude for therapeutic initiatives to engineer and promote regeneration of the\ncardiovascular lineages. Given the tremendous morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease in our\nsociety, the potential impact of this proposal is significant.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThe mechanism of DNA packaging for double-stranded DNA viruses will be studied in the Bacillus\nsubtilis bacteriophage \u03c629, the most efficient in vitro viral packaging system known. Using an\nintegrated genetic, biochemical, single-molecule and structural approach, we will characterize\nprotein conformational change and movement in the transiently assembled packaging motor during\nDNA encapsidation. The mechanism of packaging in \u03c629 will serve as a model for animal virus\npackaging in the analogous herpesvirus and adenovirus systems, and aid in the search for new\nantiviral therapies. Due to similarities between the \u03c629 ATPase and other ring translocases, insights\ngained from the study of \u03c629 packaging will also provide insight into the basic principles of\nmacromolecular motor function in higher organisms. As part of our long-term and multicomponent\nefforts to interrogate the mechanism of DNA packaging, here we will: 1 \u2013 Characterize the\nstructure, dynamics, and energy landscape of DNA packaging motors. In Aim 1.1, we will use\nstandard cryoEM SPA and nested highly focused reconstructions to test structural predictions of the\nhelical to planar model. In Aim 1.2: we will utilize advanced image processing approaches to\ncharacterize the dynamics and energy landscape of packaging motors, and 2 \u2013 Complete single-\nmolecule studies of ring motor mechanism. In Aim 2.1 we will use single molecule optical laser\ntweezers to dissect how key residues participate in critical functions during DNA translocation.\nFurther, we will utilize combined single molecule imaging and force measurements to characterize\nDNA rotation during DNA packaging (Aim 2.2) and to correlate changes in motor conformation with\nDNA translocation (Aim 2.3).",

    "abstract_text": "RESEARCH SUMMARY\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) accounts for the largest percentage of active substance use disorders. One\nprominent trait of AUD is compulsive use despite adverse consequences. Previous work has found that animals\nwho drink alcohol in excess display diminished lateral habenula (LHb) activity, a brain region widely\nacknowledged to participate in aversive behaviors, suggesting that LHb hypoactivity may be an integral factor in\ncompulsive alcohol use. However, mechanisms that contribute to these reductions in LHb activity have not been\nfully explored. Comprehensive assessment of LHb plasticity in preclinical models of AUD through the\nmeasurement of afferent neurotransmission dynamics could offer potential insight into a neurobiological basis\nfor the reduced LHb activity observed in aversion resistance. One afferent region of particular interest is the\nventral pallidum (VP). Recent findings have shown that VP glutamate (VPGlu) neurons, which project extensively\ninto the LHb, contribute to adaptive constraint of natural reward consumption and reduction of drug-seeking\nactions. Yet, there remains a significant knowledge gap concerning potential alterations of LHb-projecting VP\nneurons that arise in response to the development of aversion-resistant alcohol use. Clarifying the changes that\noccur in both multiregional and VP-specific afferent input is necessary to improve our understanding of\nphysiological alterations preventing normative aversive behavior in aversion-resistant drinking. Thus, the broad\ngoal of the proposed work is to elucidate neurobiological adaptations of LHb afferent projections during\ncompulsive alcohol consumption.\nThe primary objective of this proposal is twofold: first, to investigate the impact of alcohol use on afferent\nneurotransmission into the LHb during aversion resistant alcohol consumption, and second, to explore the\nsignificance of VP-to-LHb projections in this behavior. Given that afferent input from several distinct brain regions\nhas been shown to influence aversive behavior and alcohol misuse, I hypothesize that LHb afferent\nneurotransmission is adaptably dysregulated in animals that exhibit aversion resistant alcohol use,\nwhich may be due in part to changes in activity of VP inputs. To test this hypothesis, I will use in vivo fiber\nphotometry to record neurotransmitter activity in the LHb and optogenetics to manipulate VP-to-LHb projections\nduring aversion-resistant alcohol consumption alongside histological techniques to quantify neurochemical\ncontent of LHb projections. Experiments proposed here will advance our understanding of the neural\nmechanisms underlying aversion-resistant alcohol use, establishing a foundation for future research examining\nLHb-associated neural circuitry in compulsive alcohol use.

    "abstract_text": "RESEARCH SUMMARY\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) accounts for the largest percentage of active substance use disorders. One\nprominent trait of AUD is compulsive use despite adverse consequences. Previous work has found that animals\nwho drink alcohol in excess display diminished lateral habenula (LHb) activity, a brain region widely\nacknowledged to participate in aversive behaviors, suggesting that LHb hypoactivity may be an integral factor in\ncompulsive alcohol use. However, mechanisms that contribute to these reductions in LHb activity have not been\nfully explored. Comprehensive assessment of LHb plasticity in preclinical models of AUD through the\nmeasurement of afferent neurotransmission dynamics could offer potential insight into a neurobiological basis\nfor the reduced LHb activity observed in aversion resistance. One afferent region of particular interest is the\nventral pallidum (VP). Recent findings have shown that VP glutamate (VPGlu) neurons, which project extensively\ninto the LHb, contribute to adaptive constraint of natural reward consumption and reduction of drug-seeking\nactions. Yet, there remains a significant knowledge gap concerning potential alterations of LHb-projecting VP\nneurons that arise in response to the development of aversion-resistant alcohol use. Clarifying the changes that\noccur in both multiregional and VP-specific afferent input is necessary to improve our understanding of\nphysiological alterations preventing normative aversive behavior in aversion-resistant drinking. Thus, the broad\ngoal of the proposed work is to elucidate neurobiological adaptations of LHb afferent projections during\ncompulsive alcohol consumption.\nThe primary objective of this proposal is twofold: first, to investigate the impact of alcohol use on afferent\nneurotransmission into the LHb during aversion resistant alcohol consumption, and second, to explore the\nsignificance of VP-to-LHb projections in this behavior. Given that afferent input from several distinct brain regions\nhas been shown to influence aversive behavior and alcohol misuse, I hypothesize that LHb afferent\nneurotransmission is adaptably dysregulated in animals that exhibit aversion resistant alcohol use,\nwhich may be due in part to changes in activity of VP inputs. To test this hypothesis, I will use in vivo fiber\nphotometry to record neurotransmitter activity in the LHb and optogenetics to manipulate VP-to-LHb projections\nduring aversion-resistant alcohol consumption alongside histological techniques to quantify neurochemical\ncontent of LHb projections. Experiments proposed here will advance our understanding of the neural\nmechanisms underlying aversion-resistant alcohol use, establishing a foundation for future research examining\nLHb-associated neural circuitry in compulsive alcohol use. Throughout this proposal, I will gain valuable training\nin the execution of behavioral neuroscience experiments, in vivo neurotransmitter recording methods, neuronal\nmanipulation techniques, histological processing, and advanced computational strategies. This project will allow\nme to build a firm foundation for a successful career as an independent investigator.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT (CATALYST PROJECT)\nWhile much research has been dedicated to understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD),\nthe neural circuit dynamics underlying the manifestation of motor signs remain to be determined. Current theories\npropose that the power and incidence of beta band (11-35 Hz) oscillations, synchronized throughout the basal\nganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit, are associated with the severity of motor signs. Although changes in\nbradykinesia and rigidity related to levodopa and deep brain stimulation (DBS) have been shown to correlate\nwith the power of local field potential (LFP) oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), no study has\ndeductively demonstrated their causal relationship. Clarifying whether this relationship is causal or\nepiphenomenon is critical to advance our understanding of PD pathophysiology. The goal of this Catalyst\nProject is to characterize the relationship of rigidity and bradykinesia with beta band oscillations and\ntheir propagation dynamics in the BGTC circuit. We will leverage a new neural control approach capable\nof suppressing or amplifying frequency-specific neural oscillations in real-time using DBS leads. This\ntechnique, referred to as evoked-interference closed-loop DBS (eiDBS), is based on the concept that electrical\nstimulation with precise amplitude and timing can evoke neural responses that modulate spontaneous neural\nactivity via constructive or destructive interference. We will characterize how controlled suppression or\namplification of beta band activity in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) or the STN via eiDBS\nrelates to the severity of rigidity and bradykinesia in PD patients. We will also test the hypothesis that changes\nin the propagation of beta band oscillations (information flow) across the GPi, STN, motor (MC), premotor (PMC),\nand dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortices will be better correlated with rigidity and bradykinesia than the\namplitude of beta band oscillations alone (Aims 1,2). Furthermore, we will characterize the spectral, temporal,\nand spatial dynamics of neural responses in the BGTC circuit evoked by stimulation in the GPi and STN. By\ncombining the evoked response (ER) data with high-resolution imaging and computational modeling, we will\ndelineate how activation of distinct neuronal pathways in the GPi and STN influences ER dynamics, critical not\nonly to optimize eiDBS, but also to provide insights into the mechanism(s) of action of DBS (Aim 3).",

Concomitantly, there has been an explosive expansion of vector-borne\ndisease agents, especially obligate intracellular bacteria transmitted by ticks including the recently described\nhuman anaplasmosis agent, Anaplasma phagoctophilum (Ap) that causes a severe and potentially life-\nthreatening illness. Progress in our understanding of this and related organisms has been hindered by the\ninherent difficulties with manipulation of obligate intracellular bacteria in the order Rickettsiales. Moreover,\nover 30% of their encoded genes have no matches in the databases, and are thus of unknown function. While\nbioinformatics algorithms offer an approach to predict form and function, these predictions are unreliable. At\nthe same time, uptake of existing genetic systems has been slow, in part due to their limitations. To alleviate this\nsituation, we propose to employ a modified himar1 transposon-transposase system that enables efficient\nreplacement of the transposon with another cassette containing a wild-type copy of the mutated gene using\nrecombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE), a well-established molecular technique, to restore gene\nfunction. We will accomplish our planned projects following four specific aims: Aim 1: Generate a collection of\nAp mutants recovered in tick vector and human host cell culture using the himar1 transposon system where the\ntransposon is designed with flanking mis-matched lox sequences to allow subsequent replacement of the\ntransposon using RMCE. Aim 2: Determine insertion sites using whole genome sequencing. This will be\nfacilitated through the use of the Ap-HGE1 isolate for which the genome sequence is available. Aims 1 and 2 will\nbe carried out during the Phase I (R61) component of the application, and set the stage/provide the mutants for\nthe subsequent Aims 3 and 4, which will occupy the Phase II (R33) component of the award.

Mutants of interest\nwill be selected for RMCE to restore gene function, and successful RMCE will be verified using site-specific PCR\nand Sanger sequencing coupled with assessment of restored phenotype.

Concomitantly, there has been an explosive expansion of vector-borne\ndisease agents, especially obligate intracellular bacteria transmitted by ticks including the recently described\nhuman anaplasmosis agent, Anaplasma phagoctophilum (Ap) that causes a severe and potentially life-\nthreatening illness. Progress in our understanding of this and related organisms has been hindered by the\ninherent difficulties with manipulation of obligate intracellular bacteria in the order Rickettsiales. Moreover,\nover 30% of their encoded genes have no matches in the databases, and are thus of unknown function. While\nbioinformatics algorithms offer an approach to predict form and function, these predictions are unreliable. At\nthe same time, uptake of existing genetic systems has been slow, in part due to their limitations. To alleviate this\nsituation, we propose to employ a modified himar1 transposon-transposase system that enables efficient\nreplacement of the transposon with another cassette containing a wild-type copy of the mutated gene using\nrecombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE), a well-established molecular technique, to restore gene\nfunction. We will accomplish our planned projects following four specific aims: Aim 1: Generate a collection of\nAp mutants recovered in tick vector and human host cell culture using the himar1 transposon system where the\ntransposon is designed with flanking mis-matched lox sequences to allow subsequent replacement of the\ntransposon using RMCE. Aim 2: Determine insertion sites using whole genome sequencing. This will be\nfacilitated through the use of the Ap-HGE1 isolate for which the genome sequence is available. Aims 1 and 2 will\nbe carried out during the Phase I (R61) component of the application, and set the stage/provide the mutants for\nthe subsequent Aims 3 and 4, which will occupy the Phase II (R33) component of the award. Aim 3: Test\ninfectivity of selected mutants and of genetically \u201crestored\u201d mutants in vitro using multiple tick and mammalian\ncell lines, and verify gene knock-out/knock-in using RT-PCR to demonstrate absence and restored presence of\ntranscripts, and immune-assays to demonstrate absence/restored presence of gene products. Mutants of interest\nwill be selected for RMCE to restore gene function, and successful RMCE will be verified using site-specific PCR\nand Sanger sequencing coupled with assessment of restored phenotype. Aim 4: Test infectivity of selected\nmutants and of genetically \u201crestored\u201d mutants in vivo in ticks and mice, including tick transmission studies.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nGene therapy provides a universal therapeutic option for patients with genetic or acquired disorders that can\npotentially benefit a broad patient populations. However, up to date several gene therapy clinical trials for lung-\nspecific diseases, while well addressing safety concerns, have failed to demonstrate clear therapeutic benefits\namong the participated patients. This dismal reality is most likely attributed to the inability to achieve clinically-\nrelevant gene transfer efficacy in the airway epithelium, and particularly to airway basal stem cell or basal cell.\nRecently, we have demonstrated the ability of AAV serotype 6 (AAV6) vectors to achieve widespread and\nefficient transgene expression in the human airway epithelial cell (AEC) in in vitro and in the mouse models in\nvivo. Importantly, subsets of the lung cell, such as basal cells, were targeting that provides anticipation for\npossible long-term gene expression in highly renewable layer of airways. Additionally we showed in our most\nrecent published collaborative studies higher transduction efficiency over commonly used AAVs by\nextracellular vesicles associated AAV (EV-AAV) to the mouse lungs and human AEC cultured in air-liquid\ninterface conditions. The large cargo of average EVs (100-200 nm) allows accumulation of multiple AAV\nparticles (20-25 nm), and, unlike AAV, EVs enter cells multiple by ways that do not depend on receptor\nabundance. These important findings lead to the development of current proposal that combines non-invasive\nin vivo imaging with post-necropsy analysis of AAV-mediated gene expression in subpopulations of airway\ncells in non-human primates (NHP) model. NHP models play a critical role in feasibility and safety modeling for\nthe development of therapeutics. The mechanistic underpinning is expected to provide critical information for\nthe design of next-generation gene therapy vectors targeting lung, which can be used for wide range of\npulmonary diseases required reliable expression of therapeutic modalities across airways.",

    "abstract_text": "The first ever International Indigenous Dementia Research Network Annual Conference series addresses a\ncritical need to advance knowledge, discovery, and scientific collaboration in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related\nDementias (ADRD) in Indigenous populations. American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), Native Hawaiians and\nPacific Islanders, First Nations in Canada, and Indigenous peoples in Australia all experience a significant\nhealth equity gap reflected in the rates of ADRD. Moreover, these racial disparities are expected to expand in\nall Indigenous populations; for example, the prevalence of ADRD in AI/AN populations is projected to increase\nalmost 6-fold by 2060. Indigenous ADRD research is an emerging field, and the number of studies is\nincreasing. In the US, Indigenous people have been referred to as an invisible minority in relation to ADRD\nresearch, but there is a core group of researchers working with Indigenous populations on dementia all over\nthe world. These scientists utilize community-based and Indigenous research methods to address dementia\nspecific topics such as caregiving, screening and diagnosis, and culturally safe care. Unfortunately, little\nattention is given to these studies in mainstream conferences and knowledge exchange has been limited.\nThere is currently no equitable venue for academics and communities studying dementia in Indigenous\npopulations to come together and share scientific and Indigenous knowledge in a way that is comparable to\nother disciplines or disease focused research areas. The consequence of this structural inequity is slow\nprogression of the field and researchers working in isolation, which leads to inadequately informed health care\nand poor policy preparation for the growing prevalence of dementia in Indigenous communities.\nTo remedy this situation, we will implement a 5-year conference series focused on ADRD in Indigenous\npopulations by bringing together current members of the International Indigenous Dementia Research Network\n(IIDRN) along with other leading scientists, policy makers, Indigenous Elders, Indigenous communities and\norganizations, people living with dementia, and trainees to exchange information on current research and\nadvancements concerning ADRD in the context of health equity. The IIDRN is a network of over 100 members\nfrom seven countries. Recognizing that ADRD in Indigenous populations is still a developing field of research,\nthese annual conferences will build and support research capacity, facilitate the development of national and\ninternational research collaborations, and sustain scientific advancement in Indigenous dementia research.\nKey components will include featured research sessions, keynote speakers, Elder involvement, mentorship,\nand volunteered papers and posters. Our long-term goal is to create an expanded, sustainable, supportive,\nworldwide network of scholars committed to knowledge exchange and collaboration to advance research,\nknowledge, and mentorship in community-based, culturally appropriate ADRD research with Indigenous\npopulations.",

    "abstract_text": "The first ever International Indigenous Dementia Research Network Annual Conference series addresses a\ncritical need to advance knowledge, discovery, and scientific collaboration in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related\nDementias (ADRD) in Indigenous populations. American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), Native Hawaiians and\nPacific Islanders, First Nations in Canada, and Indigenous peoples in Australia all experience a significant\nhealth equity gap reflected in the rates of ADRD. Moreover, these racial disparities are expected to expand in\nall Indigenous populations; for example, the prevalence of ADRD in AI/AN populations is projected to increase\nalmost 6-fold by 2060. Indigenous ADRD research is an emerging field, and the number of studies is\nincreasing. In the US, Indigenous people have been referred to as an invisible minority in relation to ADRD\nresearch, but there is a core group of researchers working with Indigenous populations on dementia all over\nthe world. These scientists utilize community-based and Indigenous research methods to address dementia\nspecific topics such as caregiving, screening and diagnosis, and culturally safe care. Unfortunately, little\nattention is given to these studies in mainstream conferences and knowledge exchange has been limited.\nThere is currently no equitable venue for academics and communities studying dementia in Indigenous\npopulations to come together and share scientific and Indigenous knowledge in a way that is comparable to\nother disciplines or disease focused research areas. The consequence of this structural inequity is slow\nprogression of the field and researchers working in isolation, which leads to inadequately informed health care\nand poor policy preparation for the growing prevalence of dementia in Indigenous communities.\nTo remedy this situation, we will implement a 5-year conference series focused on ADRD in Indigenous\npopulations by bringing together current members of the International Indigenous Dementia Research Network\n(IIDRN) along with other leading scientists, policy makers, Indigenous Elders, Indigenous communities and\norganizations, people living with dementia, and trainees to exchange information on current research and\nadvancements concerning ADRD in the context of health equity. The IIDRN is a network of over 100 members\nfrom seven countries. Recognizing that ADRD in Indigenous populations is still a developing field of research,\nthese annual conferences will build and support research capacity, facilitate the development of national and\ninternational research collaborations, and sustain scientific advancement in Indigenous dementia research.\nKey components will include featured research sessions, keynote speakers, Elder involvement, mentorship,\nand volunteered papers and posters. Our long-term goal is to create an expanded, sustainable, supportive,\nworldwide network of scholars committed to knowledge exchange and collaboration to advance research,\nknowledge, and mentorship in community-based, culturally appropriate ADRD research with Indigenous\npopulations.",

Compared to the majority population, Indigenous rates of Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease and related dementias (ADRD) are approximately 3 times higher. This research will adapt and validate\na battery of complementary Indigenous cognitive assessment tools developed in Canada and Australia for use\namong AI populations in the United States. This battery expands and adapts the Canadian Indigenous Cognitive\nAssessment (CICA), as well as the Australian Kimberley Indigenous assessments for depression (KICA\ndepression), Activities of Daily Living (KICA-ADL) and a caregiver report (KICA-Carer).\nCulture and context are central to Indigenous peoples\u2019 experience with dementia and dementia diagnosis. Due\nto significant cultural differences between tribal populations in Australia, Canada, and the US, existing\nIndigenous culturally valid clinical tools cannot be used in the US until they are first adapted and re-validated.\nUntil unbiased tools are developed, we run the risk of basing critical clinical and policy decisions on flawed\nepidemiological estimates of ADRD which, in turn, further exacerbates dementia inequities. Using community-\nbased participatory research approaches blended with Indigenous methodologies, we will revise existing\nIndigenous assessments to align with AI cultural context as well as the neuropsychiatric properties. We intend\nto measure and assess the reliability, validity, and cultural acceptance of the adapted instruments with a total of\n390 dyads of people with dementia and their caregivers (n=780) in in two culturally distinct tribal communities in\nMinnesota, Wisconsin, and an urban AI population in New Mexico. Our central hypothesis is that developing a\nculturally safe cognitive assessment approach that accounts for cultural context will provide accurate diagnoses,\nwhich in turn will help us achieve our long-term goal of improving the diagnosis and care of Indigenous persons\nwith dementia across the ADRD continuum. Our specific aims are to: 1) create American Indian appropriate\nversions of the CICA Cog, KICA Carer, KICA depression and KICA-ADL (the \u201cAMICA battery\u201d); 2) assess the\npsychometric properties and cultural acceptability of the four tools in the AMICA battery. We hypothesize that\nthe AMICA battery will demonstrate strong reliability, validity, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative\npredictive value relative to the two-eyed seeing consensus diagnosis. Thus the AMICA battery will produce the\nsame diagnoses, while providing greater cultural safety, than the standard assessments. By achieving these\naims we can expect to deliver the first culturally adapted valid cognitive assessment battery for American Indian\nolder adults. In doing so, this research will help to reduce disparities, accelerate research, and enhance access\nto high quality clinical practice.",

Our central hypothesis is that\nculture and community-specific context shape ADRD illness experiences in Indigenous populations\nsignificantly enough to create distinct impacts of ADRD requiring culturally tailored approaches to diagnosis,\ncare and education. Our goal is to create a foundational ethnographic database of AI/FN lived experience of\nADRD that can be examined to inform the creation of culturally appropriate and safe approaches to improve\ndementia diagnostics, care and outreach. Our findings will inform our longer-term goal to create culturally safe\nclinical guidelines and dementia diagnosis and care tools for North American Indigenous populations.\nAI/FN ADRD rates are approximately three times higher, with a 10-year earlier onset, compared to majority\npopulations. Higher rates of co-morbidities and limited access to social, economic, and health resources\nincrease Indigenous health disparities. Culture and community context influence Indigenous peoples\u2019\nexperience with dementia and culturally grounded approaches/resources increase awareness and improve\noutcomes. Currently, there is little information to guide culturally appropriate efforts to address ADRD.\nUsing community-based participatory research (CBPR), ICARE engages AI/FN communities in Minnesota,\nWisconsin and Ontario. We will undertake a CBPR qualitative ethnographic examination of the AI/FN lived\nexperience across the illness trajectory including: cultural understandings of ADRD; experiences with diagnosis\nand care; and AI/FN community strengths and challenges. Specific methods include participant observation\nand semi-structured in-depth interviews with people with dementia (PWD), caregivers, and healthy seniors.\nOur qualitative analytic approach incorporates both biomedical and Indigenous understandings of ADRD.\n Our research has three specific aims. First, we will document and examine the lived experiences of ADRD\nacross the disease trajectory in 3 diverse AI/FN regions (Red Lake Nation and Grand Portage, MN; Oneida\nNation, WI; Manitoulin Island, ON) and identify cultural, health systems, and community factors influencing\nADRD diagnostic and care pathways for PWD. Second, we will use this ethnographic data to delineate AI/FN\nspecific explanatory models of ADRD and understandings of ADRD Quality of Life, diagnosis and staging to\nidentify appropriate approaches to diagnose and assess ADRD in AI/FN populations. Third, we will conduct\ncollaborative knowledge translation of ethnographic knowledge into culturally appropriate health\npromotion/education tools (fact sheets, videos or training modules) to respond to community needs. This study\nrepresents an important step in identifying effective, culturally-grounded approaches to address dementia-\nrelated inequities in AI/FN populations.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nChronic kidney disease is a significant healthcare issue affecting >15% of the U.S. population and costing billions\nin healthcare dollars annually. Transplantation is the best option for most patients with progressive disease,\nresulting in a significant increase in life expectancy and improved quality of life compared to dialysis. The\npotential U.S. deceased donor organ supply is estimated to exceed the current number of organs transplanted\nby a factor of 4- to 5-fold, with a major limitation to the number of acceptable organs for transplant being the\nischemic injury sustained between recovery and implantation. A method to cryopreserve or \u201cbank\u201d kidneys prior\nto transplant would effectively remove the influence of time from the supply chain of organ distribution. This\nwould allow a new paradigm for transplantation that would improve donor/recipient matching, allow for better\npatient preparation, facilitate tolerance induction protocols, and increase organ utilization while improving graft\nand patient survival. One promising approach that overcomes the limitations of conventional strategies is\nvitrification\u2014that is, cooling organs so quickly that they cannot undergo the phase transition from liquid to solid\nice. With the help of cryoprotective agents (CPAs), the organ enters a stable glass-like state wherein viable\nstorage is theoretically indefinite. The critical challenge, however, is rewarming without ice formation or cracking:\nif rewarming is too slow, ice crystals form, and if rewarming is not uniform, thermal stress causes cracking. During\nour initial R01 funding, we developed a novel approach termed \u201cnanowarming\u201d that achieved both objectives.\nIron oxide nanoparticles were perfused throughout the vasculature of the organ along with CPA solutions. The\norgan was then vitrified by cooling and rewarmed on-demand by placing it in a radiofrequency coil that induces\nheating in the nanoparticles and, therefore, from within the organ. We found that nanowarming could rewarm\nvitrified organs, including kidneys, in animal models. We have recently shown, for the first time, that nanowarmed\norgans function in vitro and in vivo following transplantation. Further, we showed successful vitrification and\nnanowarming of human-sized (porcine) kidneys. These new data support the feasibility of our approach to\ncryopreserve and nanowarm whole human organs for transplantation. Nevertheless, many questions\nremain, including how nanowarmed kidneys function compared to control organs, what, if any, injury occurs\nduring nanowarming, and how to scale up to human-sized organs. In this renewal R01, we propose to: (1)\nQuantitatively assess cryopreserved and nanowarmed kidney transplant function in a rat model, including long-\nterm preservation, long-term function, modes of injury, and alterations of the host immune response, (2) Engineer\nand optimize scale-up for nanowarming vitrified human-sized organs, and (3) Vitrify and nanowarm human-sized\nkidneys while measuring viability, structural integrity, and organ function.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nThe biochemical hallmark of FKRP-associated dystroglycanopathies is the hypoglycosylation of \u03b1-dystroglycan\n(\u03b1-DG), which leads to disruption in the interaction of \u03b1-DG with extracellular matrix proteins, ultimately leading\nto muscle wasting. Recessive mutations in FKRP are associated with a heterogeneous spectrum of muscle\ndisorders, ranging from severe early-onset to mild late-onset limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2I) to several\nforms of congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1C), including severe Walker-Warburg Syndrome. Respiratory\nimpairment due to loss of diaphragm function is a prominent complication of both LGMD2I and MDC1C. No\napproved therapy currently exists for dystroglycanopathies. There has been tremendous excitement for the\ntherapeutic potential of reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in treating genetic diseases. The\npremise of this project is that stem cell-based therapy consisting of human skeletal myogenic progenitors derived\nfrom iPSCs will replenish diseased muscle with normal functional muscle fibers as well as muscle stem cells,\nwhich have the potential to provide long-term therapeutic effect in dystroglycanopathies. We have developed\nand extensively validated a method to generate engraftable skeletal myogenic progenitors from pluripotent stem\ncells through conditional expression of Pax3 or Pax7. This approach results in highly efficient generation of\ntherapeutic myogenic progenitors, which when transplanted into dystrophic mice locally or systemically produce\nlarge quantities of functional skeletal muscle tissue that incorporates normally into the host muscle. Importantly,\na fraction of transplanted cells remains mononuclear, and displays key features of skeletal muscle stem cells,\nincluding satellite cell localization, response to re-injury, and contribution to muscle regeneration in secondary\ntransplantation assays. Therefore, our technology comprises a cell therapy to rebuild functional skeletal muscle,\nrobust to future damage, in hosts with muscular dystrophy. We have recently shown that mouse and human\nPSC-derived myogenic progenitors contribute to significant myofiber and satellite cell repopulation in the\nimmunodeficient FKRPP448L-NSG mouse model that we generated. Of therapeutic relevance, we have evidence\nof successful delivery of these myogenic progenitors directly into the diaphragm of FKRP mice. In addition, we\nhave developed a universal gene correction strategy for FKRP, applied this to patient-specific WWS and LGMD2I\niPSCs, and demonstrated in vitro and in vivo rescue of functional \u03b1-DG glycosylation. In this application, we\npropose studies that are critical for the development of successful therapeutic approaches for\ndystroglycanopathies, including understanding 1) the effect of the environment on the engraftment of\ntransplanted cells and 2) the long-term functionality and molecular characteristics of human gene edited WWS\nand unaffected iPSC-derived myogenic progenitors, important for both autologous and allogeneic future\ntherapeutic applications, respectively.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nThe biochemical hallmark of FKRP-associated dystroglycanopathies is the hypoglycosylation of \u03b1-dystroglycan\n(\u03b1-DG), which leads to disruption in the interaction of \u03b1-DG with extracellular matrix proteins, ultimately leading\nto muscle wasting. Recessive mutations in FKRP are associated with a heterogeneous spectrum of muscle\ndisorders, ranging from severe early-onset to mild late-onset limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2I) to several\nforms of congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1C), including severe Walker-Warburg Syndrome. Respiratory\nimpairment due to loss of diaphragm function is a prominent complication of both LGMD2I and MDC1C. No\napproved therapy currently exists for dystroglycanopathies. There has been tremendous excitement for the\ntherapeutic potential of reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in treating genetic diseases. The\npremise of this project is that stem cell-based therapy consisting of human skeletal myogenic progenitors derived\nfrom iPSCs will replenish diseased muscle with normal functional muscle fibers as well as muscle stem cells,\nwhich have the potential to provide long-term therapeutic effect in dystroglycanopathies. We have developed\nand extensively validated a method to generate engraftable skeletal myogenic progenitors from pluripotent stem\ncells through conditional expression of Pax3 or Pax7. This approach results in highly efficient generation of\ntherapeutic myogenic progenitors, which when transplanted into dystrophic mice locally or systemically produce\nlarge quantities of functional skeletal muscle tissue that incorporates normally into the host muscle. Importantly,\na fraction of transplanted cells remains mononuclear, and displays key features of skeletal muscle stem cells,\nincluding satellite cell localization, response to re-injury, and contribution to muscle regeneration in secondary\ntransplantation assays. Therefore, our technology comprises a cell therapy to rebuild functional skeletal muscle,\nrobust to future damage, in hosts with muscular dystrophy. We have recently shown that mouse and human\nPSC-derived myogenic progenitors contribute to significant myofiber and satellite cell repopulation in the\nimmunodeficient FKRPP448L-NSG mouse model that we generated. Of therapeutic relevance, we have evidence\nof successful delivery of these myogenic progenitors directly into the diaphragm of FKRP mice. In addition, we\nhave developed a universal gene correction strategy for FKRP, applied this to patient-specific WWS and LGMD2I\niPSCs, and demonstrated in vitro and in vivo rescue of functional \u03b1-DG glycosylation. In this application, we\npropose studies that are critical for the development of successful therapeutic approaches for\ndystroglycanopathies, including understanding 1) the effect of the environment on the engraftment of\ntransplanted cells and 2) the long-term functionality and molecular characteristics of human gene edited WWS\nand unaffected iPSC-derived myogenic progenitors, important for both autologous and allogeneic future\ntherapeutic applications, respectively.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nMuscular dystrophies are genetically and clinically heterogeneous disorders characterized by progressive\nweakness and degeneration of the skeletal muscles that control movement. The most common, Duchenne\nMuscular Dystrophy (DMD), is caused by genetic and biochemical defects of the dystrophin-glycoprotein\ncomplex (DGC). These alterations lead to cell membrane damage and death of muscle cells, resulting in chronic\ntissue degeneration and impaired muscle contractility. Although no effective treatment is available at present,\none attractive therapeutic approach is to use cell-based therapies to promote muscle regeneration. There has\nbeen tremendous excitement for the therapeutic potential of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in treating\ngenetic diseases since these cells have virtually unlimited proliferation potential, and can differentiate into all cell\ntypes. We have pioneered a method to generate engraftable skeletal myogenic progenitors from pluripotent stem\ncells through conditional expression of Pax3 or Pax7. This approach results in highly efficient generation of\ntherapeutic myogenic progenitors, which when transplanted into dystrophic mice locally or systemically produce\nlarge quantities of functional skeletal muscle tissue that incorporates normally into the host muscle. Importantly,\na fraction of transplanted cells remains mononuclear, and displays key features of skeletal muscle stem cells,\nincluding satellite cell localization, response to re-injury, and contribution to muscle regeneration in secondary\ntransplantation assays. Based on these encouraging findings, we have begun the manufacturing of these cells\nunder cGMP compatible conditions and performed preclinical studies in murine recipients. The results from these\nstudies are promising but before moving this therapy towards clinical translation, it would be ideal to assess\nscalability, delivery, distribution, safety, and engraftment in larger animal models. Therefore, here we propose\npreclinical studies to investigate these parameters using non-human primates (NHP) as recipients. It will also be\ncritical to understand the impact of HLA mismatch on muscle engraftment, and NHP represent the ideal system\nto properly address this question. The transplantation of NHP iPS cell-derived myogenic progenitors into NHP\nrecipients will provide critical knowledge for understanding tolerance in the allogeneic setting. This aspect, which\nhas important implications for regenerative medicine, has been mostly overlooked in the pluripotent stem cell\nfield. These are all critical prerequisites to advance this therapy towards successful clinical translation.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nPluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells) have the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into multiple lineages\nin vitro. This makes these cells a powerful tool to study early embryonic developmental pathways and to generate\nspecific cell populations for regenerative medicine and disease investigation. Our research group has pioneered\nmethods to derive large quantities of skeletal myogenic progenitor cells from mouse and human pluripotent ES\nand iPS cells. Upon transplantation into dystrophic mice, these progenitors are not only able to generate new\nfunctional myofibers, but also to seed the satellite cell compartment, thus providing long-term regeneration. With\nprior NIH support, we defined the molecular signature of in vitro-generated PSC-derived myogenic progenitors\nby comparing their transcriptome profiles to those of primary skeletal myogenic progenitors isolated at different\ndevelopmental stages. Our findings revealed that PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess a molecular\nsignature similar to embryonic/fetal myoblasts. Paradoxically however, they differ functionally from fetal\nmyoblasts, as PSC-derived myogenic progenitors show much superior myofiber engraftment and ability to seed\nthe satellite cell niche, respond to multiple re-injuries and contribute to long-term regeneration. These results led\nus to hypothesize that exposure to the adult host skeletal muscle environment may induce molecular changes\nin transplanted cells. We found this to be the case as transcriptome analysis of PSC-derived mononuclear cells\n(MNCs) re-isolated after engraftment revealed a shift in molecular signature from embryonic/fetal towards\nneonatal/adult stages. In this renewal application we propose studies to understand i) the interaction and\nmolecular cues provided by the adult niche that favor the in vivo maturation of PSC-derived myogenic\nprogenitors, ii) the role of post-transcriptional regulation in this process, and iii) the dynamics of engraftment and\nthe quiescence status of specific donor-derived sub-fractions.",

LDs interact with numerous organelles,\nespecially ER and mitochondria, which are thought to coordinate de novo LD biogenesis and fatty acid (FA)\ntransfer/oxidation, respectively.

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary / Abstract\nA group of principal investigators at the University of Minnesota seeks to renew our Training Program under the\nnew title \u201cFunctional Multi-omics of Aging\u201d to support predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. The goal of the\nTraining Program is to assist exceptional young scientists develop the intellectual and technical skills needed for\nproductive careers as biomedical researchers and educators in aging biology with a focus on training in -omics\ntechnologies. The Training Program is in its 14th year of funding and has trained 23 pre- and 15 post-doctoral\ntrainees. Didactic training occurs through four T32-led courses covering fundamental biology that drives aging,\nthe Geroscience Hypothesis of Aging, emerging -omics technologies in aging research, and professional\ndevelopment to prepare trainees for the next step in their scientific careers. Novel to this funding period, the\nTraining Program will interface with the newly established and continually expanding Institute on the Biology of\nAging and Metabolism (iBAM) at the University of Minnesota to further provide trainees experiential training in\nthe biology of aging and multi-omics through workshops, conferences, seminars, symposia, journal clubs, and a\nvisitorship program. Through iBAM, our institution has recruited internationally prominent researchers in aging\nbiology and with this explosion of energy and ideas, our training faculty has grown from 19 to 23, diversifying\nrank, background, and departmental homes. Training faculty research focuses on the use of -omics technologies\nto reveal the molecular details behind aging and they draw trainees from five graduate programs: Biochemistry,\nMolecular Biology and Biophysics, Chemistry, Integrative Biology & Physiology, Neuroscience, and\nRehabilitation Science. New leadership of this T32 takes on an MPI structure to capture the breadth of needs\nwith Drs. Arriaga, Lowe, and Niedernhofer synergizing their expertise in graduate education, -omics technology,\naging research, and professional development. Our aging research is supported by outstanding genomics,\nproteomics, and imaging cores at UMN equipped with state-of-the-art single cell and spatial transcriptomics and\nproteomics platforms. These new developments have led to an even stronger Training Program as measured\nby the publication records and research career success of past trainees as well as the funding and training\nrecords of Training Program faculty. Together, the team of distinguished mentors, the extensive interdisciplinary\ncollaborations among faculty and trainees from multiple departments, the technological resources, and the\ndidactic and experiential training helps our trainees to shape successful careers in aging research.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nChronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with\nrepeated mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). CTE is among the many neurodegenerative diseases\ncharacterized as tauopathies, wherein the protein tau, which is usually associated with\nmicrotubules in the axons of neurons, becomes separated from microtubules, initiating a\ndegenerative cascade and leading to eventual neurofunctional loss. There are currently no\npharmacological treatments available for CTE patients, so any treatment that could limit or\nreverse tau-associated dysfunction would have an important impact on TBI patient outcomes.\nMoreover, given the similarity between CTE and other tauopathies, insights into CTE treatment\ncould be broadly applicable to other common neurodegenerative diseases.\nWe have recently developed an in vitro model that directly links mechanical injury to tau pathology\nin cultured neurons. One notable outcome from our prior studies is that we found that synaptic\ndysfunction (measured using patch clamp) is correlated with mislocalization of tau to dendritic\nspines (measured using fluorescent imaging). This result suggests that this relatively simple\nimage-based readout could be used for screening the effects of pharmacological agents on the\nfunctional progression of trauma-induced tauopathy.\nThere are currently no high-throughput in vitro models for screening the effects of\npharmaceuticals on trauma-induced tauopathy. We have developed several cell stretching\nsystems, both for neurotrauma and other applications. However, all of these systems are far too\nlow-throughput for performing drug discovery studies. Thus, our goal is to scale up our current in\nvitro neurotrauma model to a high-enough throughput for drug screening studies. We will design\na new stretchable multi-well plate for neuronal cell culture and a new high strain rate stretcher\nthat can apply trauma-like loads to the cells in the plate. In addition, we will employ machine\nlearning based algorithms to quickly and efficiently analyze the data collected from our new\ndevice. Finally, we will use the device to test inhibitors known to be effective against other aspects\nof neuronal injury affect tau mislocalization",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\n The mesocorticostriatal network is central to adaptive reward processes, as well as diseases of\ndysfunctional learning, motivation, and cognition. As learning progresses, there is a transition from initial\nreliance on nucleus accumbens (NAC) to later recruitment of dorsolateral striatum (DLS), which drives a shift\nfrom goal-directed behavior to more automatic behaviors characterized by rapid, stimulus-driven movement\nsequences.

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nEnvironmental stimuli (\u201ccues\u201d \u2013 sensory information such as sights, sounds, and smells) help organize reward\nseeking and decision making. In disease states like addiction drug-related cues can acquire powerful control\nover behavior, promoting exaggerated drug intake and relapse. Cues vary in their sensory modality, temporal\nprofile, and their relationship with one another and behavior. Within this complex sensory landscape, not all\nindividuals respond the same way to reward cues. For example, some rats, when trained to associate a\ndiscrete, localizable cue with a food reward in a Pavlovian conditioning procedure, develop cue-directed\napproach behavior, known at sign tracking. Other rats develop approach behavior directed at the location of\nreward delivery, termed goal tracking. In preliminary studies we expand this notion to show that discrete\nversus state-based drug-associated cues preferentially evoke relapse of drug seeking in different subsets of\nrats. Here, we will investigate how Pavlovian reward-learning strategies (e.g., sign versus goal tracking) predict\nan individual\u2019s unique relapse trigger, for greater understanding of vulnerability to addiction. To explore the\nneural mechanisms of these behaviors, we focus on the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a critical brain site for\nthe integration of sensory and emotional information to guide associative learning and goal-directed behavior.\nDopamine neurons, in addition to their classic striatal targets, also project strongly to the BLA, where densely\nexpressed D1-type dopamine receptors reside. Here, we will examine the role of BLA dopamine and D1\nneurons in the emergence and expression of reward-based learning and addiction-like behaviors. In three\nAims, we will test the central hypothesis that individual differences in reward learning strategies reflect\nbiased responsivity to proximal vs state-based sensory information, resulting in unique vulnerabilities\nto addiction-like behavior that are encoded and controlled by dopamine signaling within the BLA.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nAdolescence is one of the most critical periods of neurodevelopment. The brain undergoes a profound\nreorganization during this stage, including the formation and stabilization of neural circuits that control decision-\nmaking. We, and others, hypothesize that age-related improvements in decision-making are driven by changes\nin brain circuits that encode specific decision-making mechanisms. Direct evidence supporting this hypothesis,\nhowever, has been limited. The prefrontal cortex in particular undergoes an intense restructuring during\nadolescence and brain imaging studies have observed robust changes in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and\nanterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The OFC and ACC are altered in individuals with mental illness, which is thought\nto be the mechanism underlying decision-making deficits that emerge in these clinical populations. When and\nhow these alterations occur is not known, but emerging evidence suggests developmental changes in subcortical\nprojections to the OFC and ACC may be involved. Here, we propose to use in vivo calcium imaging and\noptogenetic techniques coupled with computational modeling, to longitudinally assess circuit and neuronal\nactivity in behaving rats at multiple adolescent ages to determine how developmental changes in OFC and ACC\nnetworks mediate improvements in decision-making. In Aim 1 we will determine how encoding of attention and\nreward-prediction errors in amygdala and ventral tegmental area (VTA) projections to the OFC improves across\nadolescence in rats using a reversal-learning task. We will then use a new transsynaptic tracing approach in Aim\n2 to demonstrate that attention and reward prediction errors controlled by amygdala and VTA projections are\nintegrated into OFC neurons to determine the degree to which action values are updated and strengthened\nduring adolescence. Finally, Aim 3 studies will investigate the role of OFC projections to the ACC in integrating\nvalue updating with current action value estimates that guide adaptive decision making. Together, these studies\nwill provide key insights into the developmental mechanisms that guide complex decision making. Our normative\ndata will provide a framework for identifying and understanding the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of mental\nillness, and inspire future translational studies.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract-Overall Coordinated and integrated care programs for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) and their family caregivers are growing. These models of care integrate disease care management, provide multidisciplinary care planning, and navigate healthcare and social service systems for persons living with dementia and their caregivers. However, knowledge of these services\u2019 effectiveness is limited due to the lack of high-quality data at the state and sub-state levels, which hampers evaluation of policies that support integrated/coordinated dementia care services. Lack of data also inhibits opportunities to adapt and scale integrated/coordinated dementia care services within and across states. The State Alzheimer\u2019s Research Support Center (StARS) will guide states through partnership, engagement, and 1-year pilot projects to build collaborations and create a shared data infrastructure to advance the accessibility, affordability, and effectiveness of dementia care services across the United States. Guided by the National Institute on Aging Health Disparities Research Framework, the specific aims are as follows: 1) to establish partnerships to identify existing coordinated/integrated dementia care services and available data sources within states; 2) to support up to 16 dementia care pilot projects; 3) to build a within- and across state data infrastructure to evaluate dementia care services and policies; and 4) to implement a multifaceted dissemination strategy to promote best practices in the identification, linking, and sharing of dementia care data. The State Alzheimer\u2019s Research Support Center will create a national data infrastructure that enables states and all communities to better understand dementia care services\u2019 effects on key care transitions, such as hospitalization readmissions, nursing home admission, home health care, as well as the health and well-being of people living with dementia and their caregivers. This infrastructure will also facilitate the examination of policy variations and changes on dementia care services within and across states. The partnership building, pilot project support, and data sharing infrastructure of StARS will ultimately result in greater dissemination of integrated/coordinated dementia care services that yield positive outcomes for people with dementia and care partners.",

The Porchlight Project is multicomponent training delivered to volunteers and includes three\nestablished online training modules on person-centered dementia care; a four-session online training program\nthat demonstrates to volunteers how to apply person-centered dementia care knowledge to their interactions\nwith persons with dementia and their caregivers; and ongoing monthly coaching sessions. We will evaluate the\nreal-world efficacy of the Porchlight Project throughout Minnesota and randomly assign a minimum of 171\npersons with AD/ADRD, family caregivers, and volunteers across 19 Regional Program Coordinator regions to\none of two groups: one that receives the Porchlight Project over a 12-month period and a usual care control\ncondition that receives standard volunteer support. An embedded experimental mixed methods design will be\nutilized that will incorporate various qualitative data collection elements within the 12-month randomized\ncontrolled evaluation of the Porchlight Project (Stage III of the NIH Stage Model). Twelve month outcomes that\nwe hypothesize the Porchlight Project will influence include: 1) increased volunteer competence; 2) increases\nin quality of life and reduced loneliness for the person with AD/ADRD; and 3) increased self-efficacy,\ndecreased stress, and improved well-being for caregivers.

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nOsteoclasts are large multinucleated cells that secrete acid and proteases to resorb bone. Understanding the\nmolecular events that regulate osteoclast activity during periodontal disease is critical to treating bone loss during\ninflammatory diseases. Reversible modifications to DNA such as histone acetylation, methylation,\nphosphorylation and ubiquitylation alter the access of transcriptional machinery to DNA and regulate gene\nexpression. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) confers transcriptional repression by demethylating H3K4 or\nactivating transcription by demethylating H3K9. The role and targets of LSD1 during osteoclast differentiation\nare unknown. Results from our work with LSD1;LysM-Cre (LSD1cKO) conditional mice begins to fill this\nknowledge gap. LSD1cKO mice have smaller osteoclasts and increased BV/TV compared to LSD1WT mice.\nBulk RNA-SEQ of femur-derived osteoclast precursors from LSD1cKO mice indicate that genes in the IFN-b\npathway are upregulated compared to LSD1WT cells. Unlike those from the femur, osteoclasts generated from\nthe LSD1cKO mandible were not significantly different in size compared to their wild type littermates suggesting\na difference in skeletal site regulation by LSD1. Our data demonstrates significant bone loss in LSD1WT mice\nbut no significant bone loss in LSD1cKO mice in a ligature induced periodontitis model. In support of this, TNF-\na, an inflammatory cytokine that induces osteoclast differentiation after priming by TGF-b, was unable to induce\nosteoclast differentiation in mandible derived cells suggesting a mechanism for the inability of LSD1cKO mice to\nlose bone in ligature induced periodontal disease. The central hypothesis is that LSD1 demethylates residues\nat H3K4 to inhibit expression of genes involved in the IFN-b pathway thus allowing inflammatory cytokines to\ninduce osteoclast differentiation. In the first aim we will gain mechanistic insights by conducting an in-depth\ninvestigation of ligature induced periodontitis in mandible derived osteoclast precursors from LSD1cKO mice.\nWe will confirm our initial data that LSD1cKO mice are resistant to bone loss during ligature induced periodontitis\ndisease through micro-CT, histology, and ELISA of various cytokines. Additionally, we will perform bulk RNA-\nand ATAC-SEQ of mandible-derived preosteoclasts from un-ligated and ligated LSD1WT and -cKO mice. This\ndata will allow us to determine skeletal site-specific changes in mandible derived osteoclasts during ligature\ninduced periodontitis. In our second aim we will determine if LSD1 expression is necessary for innate immune\ntraining resulting from ligature induced periodontitis by performing single cell sequencing of bone marrow cells\nfrom LSD1WT and LSD1cKO mice. To complement our single cell sequencing we will also perform single cell\nATAC-SEQ of bone marrow cells from LSD1WT and cKO mice who have undergone innate immunity training.\nEpigenetic modifications are modifiable, potentially reversible and represent a promising group of treatments for\nperiodontal disease.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nProstate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in males. Prostate cancer cells are dependent on\na transcription factor called the androgen receptor (AR), which is activated by the androgens testosterone and\ndihydrotestosterone. Accordingly, an effective treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer is\nandrogen deprivation therapy, which blocks the effects of androgens, inhibits the AR, and halts the growth of\nprostate cancer cells. Although this form of treatment is very effective for advanced prostate cancer, the stress\nof this therapy will eventually lead to the prostate cancer cells developing resistance. In approximately 25-30%\nof cases, the stress of prostate cancer therapy will cause the prostate cancer cells to transform into cellular\nstates where they no longer resemble the original disease. These prostate cancer cells take on features of\nalternative cell types through a process called lineage plasticity. These lineage plastic prostate cancers are\nvery difficult to treat because they do not contain AR and there are no effective therapeutics available.\nAdditionally, the processes by which standard prostate cancer therapies can cause prostate cancer lineage\nplasticity is poorly understood. This proposal seeks to understand the biology of prostate cancer lineage\nplasticity and develop new therapeutic strategies to treat, prevent, or reverse this disease stage. Our\npreliminary data demonstrates the stem cell transcription factor KLF5 is up-regulated by standard prostate\ncancer therapies that inhibit the AR. Up-regulation of KLF5 enhances androgen-independent growth of\nprostate cancer cells, as well as migration and colony formation phenotypes. Functionally, the transcriptional\nprogram initiated by up-regulated KLF5 clashes with the transcriptional program activated by the AR. Because\nthe AR transcriptional program controls prostate cancer cell identity, KLF5 up-regulation breaks down this\nidentity and promotes very early steps in lineage plasticity of prostate cancer cells. We hypothesize that\ntargeting this early step in therapy-induced prostate cancer lineage plasticity will block later events that lead to\nvery aggressive, treatment-resistant manifestations of the disease. We have identified ERBB2 as a focal point\nof this tug-of-war between AR and KLF5, and shown that ERBB2 inhibitors can block the oncogenic effects of\nKLF5.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nProstate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in males. Prostate cancer cells are dependent on\na transcription factor called the androgen receptor (AR), which is activated by the androgens testosterone and\ndihydrotestosterone. Accordingly, an effective treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer is\nandrogen deprivation therapy, which blocks the effects of androgens, inhibits the AR, and halts the growth of\nprostate cancer cells. Although this form of treatment is very effective for advanced prostate cancer, the stress\nof this therapy will eventually lead to the prostate cancer cells developing resistance. In approximately 25-30%\nof cases, the stress of prostate cancer therapy will cause the prostate cancer cells to transform into cellular\nstates where they no longer resemble the original disease. These prostate cancer cells take on features of\nalternative cell types through a process called lineage plasticity. These lineage plastic prostate cancers are\nvery difficult to treat because they do not contain AR and there are no effective therapeutics available.\nAdditionally, the processes by which standard prostate cancer therapies can cause prostate cancer lineage\nplasticity is poorly understood. This proposal seeks to understand the biology of prostate cancer lineage\nplasticity and develop new therapeutic strategies to treat, prevent, or reverse this disease stage.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nProstate cancer (PC) is the most frequently diagnosed male cancer. Surgery or radiation therapy are curative\ntreatments for localized PC while systemic endocrine therapies are standard-of-care for advanced or\nmetastatic PC. The molecular target of endocrine therapy is the androgen receptor (AR), a transcription factor\nactivated by the steroid hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Because PC cells require AR for\nproliferation and survival, inhibiting testosterone production (with gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs\nand/or abiraterone acetate) and using competitive AR antagonists to block testosterone actions (such as\nenzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide) are the cornerstones of endocrine therapy. Unfortunately,\nendocrine therapy is not curative and the disease will inevitably progress to advanced castration-resistant PC\n(CRPC). CRPC is a lethal disease stage for which no curative therapies exist. Our analysis of tumor\nspecimens from patients has shown that one of the most frequent alterations occurring in CRPC is structural\nrearrangement of the AR gene. Our preliminary data show that AR gene rearrangements uncouple the AR\ntranscription factor from endocrine regulation and also from negative feedback regulation that occurs when\ntumor suppressor genes like PTEN are lost. This uncoupling renders AR activity insensitive to endocrine\ntherapies and promotes CRPC. The long term goals of this project are to harness AR gene rearrangements as\nbiomarkers to guide more effective use of current and future CRPC therapeutics, and to develop novel\ntherapeutics that can overcome the effects of AR gene rearrangements. To achieve these goals, we will\ndevelop new mouse models of CRPC progression that harbor AR gene rearrangements and PTEN loss, and\nuse these models to identify mechanisms by which AR gene rearrangements promote PC progression and\ntherapeutic resistance. These models will fill a long-standing void in the field: a lack of mouse models reflecting\nclinically-relevant AR alterations. We will test the utility of these models for advancing CRPC research by\nevaluating CRPC responses to AR-targeted therapeutics in a whole-organism context. We will also use third-\ngeneration genome structural variation analysis techniques to interrogate the structure of certain AR gene\nrearrangements that occur via complex, multi-step mechanisms. This work is expected to provide clarity about\nthe role and origin of the most frequent and complex patterns of AR gene rearrangements in CRPC. Finally,\ntherapeutic vulnerabilities of CRPC models harboring AR gene rearrangements will be evaluated using a set of\ncandidate AR-targeted therapeutics. We will also use computational methods to nominate non-AR-targeted\ntherapeutics that will have efficacy in CRPC tumors harboring AR gene rearrangements. Collectively, this work\nis expected to enhance understanding of AR gene rearrangements in CRPC progression, and yield new\nmodels, biomarkers, and therapeutics that can be used to combat this lethal subset of the disease.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\n The long-term goal of our research is to understand fundamental principles of cell communications\nmediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). HSPGs are a special type of carbohydrate-modified\nproteins that serve as co-receptors for various growth factors, including bone morphogenetic proteins,\nWnt/Wingless, and Hedgehog. These HSPG co-receptors play critical roles in quantitative and robust\ncontrol of signaling output. We study in vivo functions of HSPGs using the Drosophila model. Our earlier\nresearch has established critical roles of HSPGs in development, namely in morphogen signaling/gradient\nformation and stem cell control. Although proteoglycan biology has made significant progress, several major\nquestions remain to be elucidated. For example, the molecular mechanisms of co-receptor activities of\nHSPGs are poorly understood. It is also unknown how distinct HS structures regulate specific signaling and\npatterning events. Furthermore, despite extensive studies of HS functions in paracrine signaling, the\ninvolvement of HS in inter-organ communications remains to be determined.\n Our previous studies suggested that HSPGs cooperate with other factors to exert co-receptor\nactivity on the cell surface. Using proteomic and genetic approaches, we recently identified candidate\nmolecules of the HSPG regulators that can be classified into three groups: (1) secreted glypican-binding\nproteins, (2) transmembrane proteins, and (3) a different class of proteoglycans\u2014chondroitin sulfate\nproteoglycans (CSPGs). We will study their roles in morphogen signaling and stem cell control.\n To understand how HS structures affect signaling and morphogenesis, we have developed an \"in\nvitro\" model using Drosophila cells. Using these cell lines, we will establish a direct link between detailed\nstructural information of Drosophila HS and a wealth of knowledge on biological phenotypic information\nobtained over the last two decades using this animal model.\n Several lines of evidence suggest that Drosophila activins are novel HS-dependent factors. Three\nactivins, Act\u00df, Dawdle, and Myoglianin, regulate body size, sugar homeostasis, metabolism, and pH\nbalance through inter-organ signaling. We will study the functions of HS in trapping the source tissue,\nsystemic transport, recruiting to the target tissue, release from latency, and signal reception of activins.\n Together, this application will advance our field by: (1) defining fundamental molecular mechanisms\nof co-receptor function, (2) developing a comprehensive understanding of the structure-function relationship\nof HS, and (3) identifying novel functions of HSPGs in development and physiology.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\n A hallmark of alcohol use disorder is continued seeking and consumption of alcohol despite negative\nconsequences. Neuroadaptations in corticostriatal projections to nucleus accumbens are critical for the\ndevelopment of compulsive-like alcohol use behaviors, including in an aversion-resistant drinking model. Yet it\nremains unclear how potentiated activity in nucleus accumbens neurons alters sensitivity to aversive outcomes\nduring consumption and seeking of alcohol. Pre-existing individual differences in aversion-related circuits have\nbeen shown to predict future compulsive-like alcohol consumption. Yet, we are not aware of any\ndemonstrations of alcohol-induced neuroadaptations in aversion-related circuits that track the development of\naversion-resistant drinking, and that account for the emergence of this compulsive phenotype after alcohol\nexposure. Our long-term goal is to identify dynamics changes in the activity of aversion-related neural circuits\nthat drive the emergence of compulsive alcohol use. Here, we will examine glutamatergic basal forebrain\nneurons that project to the lateral habenula. These neurons are found in an anterior-posterior continuum from\nthe ventral pallidum to the lateral hypothalamus and are targeted by nucleus accumbens inhibitory projection\nneurons. We hypothesize that the emergence of aversion-resistant drinking requires selective inhibition of\nthese neurons during alcohol consumption.\n A crucial first step in our investigation of this circuit is to determine whether the emergence of aversion-\nresistant drinking is correlated with cell-type specific alterations in drinking-related neural activity in the\nglutamatergic basal forebrain. We will assess this question, and whether these neural correlates are\ndownstream of nucleus accumbens mechanisms in Aim 1. Our second goal is to examine lateral habenula\nglutamate activity dynamics during aversion-resistant drinking. Therefore, our Aim 2 experiments will utilize a\nfluorescent glutamate sensor combined with fiber photometry to identify temporally-specific neural correlates of\naversion-resistant drinking. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use chemogenetic approaches to assess the functional\ncontributions of basal forebrain projections to lateral habenula in aversion-resistant drinking and determine\nwhich inputs to lateral habenula from regions of the glutamatergic basal forebrain most effectively modulate\ncompulsive alcohol consumption. Together, these experiments will yield novel insights into the neural circuits\nmediating compulsive alcohol use, as well as aversion-related constraint of reward-seeking more broadly.",

We will also explore personal, social, behavioral, and environmental factors that may influence adoption of mobile market shopping. The long-term goal of our work is to improve diet/weight-related health outcomes by increasing access to and intake of healthy foods for individuals who are more likely to be impacted by poor nutrition and diet/weight-related health outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Lack of affordable, healthy food access and food insecurity are believed to be important contributing factors to these outcomes. Mobile food markets have been proposed as a strategy for improving diet-related health outcomes because they aim to improve access to low-cost, healthy food. Mobile food markets are increasingly available nationally and have been supported by state legislation, but little is known about their effectiveness. Full-service mobile markets may improve multiple aspects of the diet by providing foods to meet all dietary needs through a convenient one-stop shop. The full-service mobile market to be tested in this proposal (Twin Cities Mobile Market) sells staple foods from a bus that regularly visits low-income neighborhoods. Foods are sold at prices 10% below those of grocery stores. SNAP/EBT is accepted, and a state-funded fruit/vegetable incentive program (Market Bucks) is available to shoppers. Working in partnership with our community team members, we will enroll 6 community sites (clusters) in two waves (12 total sites/clusters) and recruit 20 participants per site (N=240). We will collect baseline data and randomize sites to either receive the full-service mobile market intervention or serve as the waitlist control. We will then implement the full-service mobile market at intervention sites, follow participants for one year, and collect follow-up data. After follow-up data collection, waitlist control sites will receive the full-service mobile market intervention. For Aim 1, changes in diet quality (our primary outcome measured with the Health Eating Index-2015) and food insecurity (measured with the 18-item U.S. Adult Food Security Survey Module) will be assessed. For Aim 2, changes in food purchases will be objectively measured by collecting one month of food purchase receipts at baseline and follow-up data collection. We will also assess mobile market food purchases during the implementation period with customer loyalty cards. For Aim 3, we will explore the factors that influence adoption of mobile market shopping.

The United Nations\nprojects that the population aged 60 and older will grow by over 50% over the next 15 years. Most of the growth\nof the older population will take place in the Global South, which will include 80% of the older population by 2050.\nThe growth of the older population in Latin America, Africa, and South Asia is occurring far more rapidly than it\ndid in the developed countries of Europe and North America. Despite its manifest significance, population aging\nin the Global South is understudied, partly because of a dearth of suitable data. To grapple with processes of\npopulation aging across the Global South over multiple decades, researchers must have access to big microdata.\nOver the past two decades, the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) has created a vast database\nof census and survey microdata covering most of the globe from the 1960s to the present. These data include\ndetailed information about each person's geographic location, demographic characteristics, and economic\nactivities. The data also cover education and literacy, fertility history, migration and place of former residence,\nmarital status and consensual unions, disabilities, water supply, sewage, housing features (e.g., floor and roof\nmaterial), and a host of other characteristics. This competing continuation proposal requests funding to expand\nand adapt the world\u2019s most comprehensive collection of census microdata to meet the needs of research on\naging in the Global South. We have four specific aims: (1) Data acquisition and long-run preservation. We will\nobtain and preserve census and survey microdata from the Global South, including the newest microdata from\nhousehold surveys and older data at risk of destruction. (2) Data processing. We plan to expand the IPUMS\ndatabase by adding data for approximately 100 million individuals included in 40 censuses and surveys, focusing\non recent data from Africa and Latin America. This expansion will require data cleaning, development of\ncomprehensive machine-processable metadata, spatial data ingest and harmonization, and variable\nharmonization. (3) Innovations in data, metadata, and technical infrastructure. We will make major improvements\nto IPUMS data and metadata while adding new capabilities to IPUMS data processing and dissemination\nsystems. (4) Dissemination and outreach. We will provide user support, training, and outreach and will develop\nnew online training capabilities. We will harness the expertise of the user community and promote collaboration\nand scientific discovery through surveys of users, workshops, and online interaction. Most critically, we will\nmaintain our network of collaboration with the national statistical agencies that provide the source data.",

MLP currently includes linked censuses from 1850 through 1940,\nadministrative records from Social Security, selected vital records, and links between several surveys of aging\nand the 1940 census. We propose to multiply the analytic power of MLP by expanding it and making it easily\ninteroperable with other sources of linked data. Under our proposed Aims, MLP will be expanded to include all\navailable records from the 1950 decennial census, new death certificate data, additional linkages to surveys of\naging, and rich data on health outcomes. To make this massive infrastructure sustainable and accessible, we\nalso propose refinement of software and methods for automatic record linkage, maintenance of the system of\nlinked records, and dissemination of linked data. The expanded and improved MLP will provide the most\ncomprehensive view of long-run changes in life-course dynamics available for any place in the world and will\ntransform our understanding of processes of population aging.\nMLP is a highly cost-effective use of scarce resources to develop shared infrastructure for research, education,\nand policy-making on health and aging. The longitudinal panel will reduce redundant effort by researchers,\nincrease data quality, and improve replicability and comparability. The proposed work is directly relevant to the\ncore mission of the Population and Social Processes branch of NIA: The new data will advance fundamental\nknowledge about the causes and consequences of changes in social, demographic, economic, and health\ncharacteristics of the older population in the U.S. and will support research on the effects of public policies, social\ninstitutions, and environmental conditions on the health, cognition, well-being, and functioning of people, both\nover the life course and in their later years.",

The\nextraordinary growth and redistribution of the human population is reshaping the planet with profound\nconsequences for population health and health behaviors. Unless we understand the processes of change, we\ncannot hope to plan adequately. To meet the challenges created by rapid demographic, economic, and\nenvironmental change, researchers must have open access to the best possible information. Over the past two\ndecades, IPUMS has created a vast archive of census and survey microdata covering 100 countries over multiple\ndecades. There has been explosive growth in the number of researchers using the database, the amount of data\nthey request, and the number of high-impact publications they produce. The massive growth of the database\nhas created new challenges, however, for data discovery, processing, and management that will require creative\nnew technical solutions. There is also high demand to further expand, improve, and support the database.\nThe proposed continuation project will expand the database, enhance the data and metadata, improve key\nelements of the infrastructure, and support the research community. Aims 1 and 2 focus on acquiring, preserving,\nand processing microdata from Asia and Europe. Aims 3 and 4 will provide infrastructure and outreach that will\nbenefit all IPUMS microdata efforts. Aim 1: Data acquisition and long-run preservation. The IPUMS International\nteam will obtain and preserve census and survey microdata from Asia and Europe, including the newest\nmicrodata from household surveys and older data at risk of destruction. Aim 2: Data processing. The project will\nexpand the IPUMS database by adding data for at least 120 million individuals included in at least 60 censuses\nand surveys, focusing on recent data from Asia and Europe. This will require data cleaning, development of\ncomprehensive machine-processable metadata, spatial data ingest and harmonization, and variable\nharmonization. Aim 3: Data, metadata, and infrastructural improvements. This project includes dozens of\nimprovements to IPUMS data and metadata while adding new capabilities to IPUMS data processing and\ndissemination systems. Aim 4: Dissemination and outreach. The project will continue to provide user support,\ntraining, and outreach and will develop new online training capabilities as well as promoting scientific discovery\nthrough surveys, workshops, and online interaction. Most critically, IPUMS will maintain collaborations with the\nnational statistical agencies who provide the source data. The improved and expanded IPUMS database will\nallow investigators to make comparisons across the world over multiple decades of social and economic\nupheaval, creating a resource of unprecedented power for understanding ongoing transformations of\ndemographic behavior and population health.",

These advances result from the ability of high resolutions to uncover layer specific (feedforward, feedback) activation patterns. These tools however are not validated in translational models that mimic human brain function. The reason for that is primarily due to our current inability to obtain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals at resolutions high enough to resolve layer specific responses in the non human primate. This project aims at developing novel and innovative radiofrequency hardware and using it at the ultra high field strength of 10.5 Tesla to directly test how well whole brain directional connectivity estimates from fMRI correspond with ground truth tract tracing experiments. This development and validation can directly aid us in translating findings from the animal model into future studies of the mesoscopic circuit effects of human mental illness.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract/Summary\nAll current techniques for the study of brain functions have limitations. Human brain activity and\nfunctional connectivity for example, can be studied with non-invasive functional whole brain MR\nmethods. However, the spatiotemporal resolution and neuronal specificity of the MR technique\nis limited. This limitation is imposed at two levels irrespective of the functional MR approach\nemployed: First, the inherent sensitivity of the MR approach limits the achievable spatial\nresolution. Although the development of UHF fMRI has enabled human studies with nominal\nvoxel volumes of ~0.5 to1 \u00b5L to permit the detection of activity in cortical layers, columns, and\nother fine scale organizations such voxels still contain more than forty to eighty thousand\nneurons, capable of performing a multitude of different computations. The second limitation is\nthe indirect nature of the MR based functional mapping signals. Irrespective of the functional\ncontrast mechanism employed, they reflect physiological changes mediated by neurovascular\ncoupling and subsequent coupling to and perturbations of MR parameters and these\nintermediary steps lead to ambiguities in spatiotemporal fidelity to neuronal activity especially at\nthe mesoscopic scale or cortical column and layers. More importantly, the relationship between\nthe MR based functional mapping signals and the underlying neuronal computations generated\nby a plethora of neuronal processes and cell types organized in complex local circuits remains\nlargely unknown. This TRD seeks to overcome these limitations by improving the MR\nmeasurements by exploiting advantages of uniquely high magnetic fields (10.5T and 16.4T) and\ndeveloping rigorous multi-modal (MRI-Electrophysiology and MRI-Multi Photon Imaging) data\nacquisition approaches these ultrahigh magnetic fields to build sharable technologies as well as\nto understand the nature of the functional MR signals.",

    "abstract_text": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an extremely lethal disease with the lowest 1-year and 5-year survival\nrates of any cancer. This is due, in part, to the extremely metastatic behavior of pancreas carcinoma cells and\ntheir extreme resistance to both chemical and radiotherapies. Importantly, we now know that a strong, but\nnevertheless unique, fibrotic and immunosuppressive stromal response is present in PDA. This intense\nfibroinflammatory, or desmoplastic, response is essentially pathognomonic for PDA and limits infiltration of\nanti-tumor immune cells and also their ability to move throughout and sample the tumor volume. Indeed,\nimmunotherapies with immune checkpoint blockade or infusion of genetically modified cells are producing\nremarkable clinical responses in other advanced malignancies, but to date, success has been much more\nlimited in PDA. However, focused preclinical strategies to disrupt the stroma or specifically engineer T cell\ntherapies have shown promise in PDA. Thus, understanding the molecular basis for engineered T cell\ninfiltration and identifying strategies to further enhance their infiltration, migration throughout tumor masses,\nand persistence and function in cancer will inform cell engineering strategies for improved treatment. Here, we\ntest a number of focused hypotheses using integrated experiments, advanced imaging, and mathematical\nmodeling to elucidate engineered T cell migratory mechanisms both in vivo and in engineered platforms in vitro\nand utilize genome editing and overexpression to engineer T cells that can maximally infiltrate and move\nthroughout complex tumor microenvironments. We hypothesize that by enhancing the ability of engineered T\ncells to move throughout tumor we can profoundly improve their efficacy and employ combinations of stroma\ntargeting and T cell therapies to improve disease outcomes. We will dissect mechanisms governing infiltration,\nlongevity and functionality of engineered T cells and determine how engineered T cell migrate within the\nphysically complex tumor environments. This information will be used engineer T cells that most effectively\nmove throughout the entire tumor mass. Using these cells, we will perform rigorous preclinical evaluation of\nour engineered T cell approach in concert with rational stroma re-engineering. Our goals are aligned with\nProjects 1 and 3 where we seek to collectively elucidate fundamental mechanisms of immune cell migration\nand to innovate novel cell engineering approaches to eradicate cancer.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nIn glioblastoma (GBM), cancer cells break away from the tumor mass and infiltrate into adjacent brain tissue.\nLike other poor-prognosis cancers, GBM has been extensively analyzed by genome-wide transcriptomic\nanalyses. This has led to the identification of 3-4 subtypes that span a spectrum of states from \u201cProneural\u201d (PN)\nto \u201cMesenchymal\u201d (MES). While the identification of subtypes is intriguing, it has yet to produce clinically-\nactionable mechanistic insight. In our unpublished work, we discovered key mechanical signatures of these two\nsubtypes. Using our Sleeping Beauty (SB) immunocompetent genetically-induced mouse glioma model, we\nfound that the oncogenic driver NRasG12V promotes a MES-like phenotype and the oncogenic driver PDGF\u03b2\npromotes a PN-like phenotype. In addition, we found that NRas-driven tumors migrate fast and generate large\ntraction forces, while PDGF\u03b2-driven tumors migrate slowly and generate weaker traction forces, features we also\nobserve with human cells in brain tissue. Thus, the two subtypes may each have their own distinct mechanical\nweaknesses that can be effectively targeted. Since brute force trial-and-error of possible targets is not feasible,\nwe will manage complexity using the modeling approach that is widely used in engineering. As pointed out in the\nOverall section of this proposal, the mobility of the cancer cells and the antitumoral T cells are both critical\ndeterminants of tumor progression/regression, so we will apply our recently published \u201cCell Migration\nSimulator\u201d (CMS1.0) to cancer and immune cell migration and use experimental microscopy measurements\nmade in brain tissue to identify the model parameters for the two GBM subtypes. This will then allow us to identify\nkey mechanical vulnerabilities that will be tested using digital multiplex T cell genome engineering (as described\nin Project 3) and will provide a computational platform for application to pancreatic cancer and immune cells (in\nProject 2). To simulate the multicellular migration, proliferation, and immune-mediated killing dynamics, we will\napply our \u201cBrownian Dynamics Tumor Simulator\u201d (BDTS1.0) to predict the overall tumor dynamics of the\nNRas (MES) and PDGF\u03b2 (PN) tumors. Interestingly, like the human disease, the NRas (MES) tumors are\nimmunologically \u2018hot\u2019, while the PDGF\u03b2 (PN) tumors are immunologically \u2018cold\u2019. Thus, the BDTS1.0, once\ndeveloped for these two subtypes of brain tumors, will allow us to predict the effects of emergent immunotherapy\nconcepts developed by our team, including CD200 peptide therapy and Peptide Alarm Therapy. By\nconstraining the simulators with data obtained by live cell fluorescence microscopy, we will develop a multiscale\ncomputational model that provides mechanistic de-risking and optimization to maximize the physical proximity\nand encounter frequency between antitumoral T cells and cancer cells. Together the modeling and experiments\nwill allow us to test our central hypothesis that T cell proximity to cancer cells is a major determinant of\nsuccessful immunotherapy of solid tumors.",

The recent vaping-related acute\nlung injuries and deaths as well as the first animal studies linking vaping to cancer have highlighted the need to\nrespond to e-cigarette use among youth.\nIn Aim 1, the project will assess the relationship between spatial density and proximity of tobacco/e-cigarette\nretailers around schools and county-level youth e-cigarette use and marketing exposure in Florida, overall and\nby county-level sociodemographic characteristics and racial/ethnic segregation. In Aim 2, it will qualitatively\nexplore where, how, why, and from whom youth access e-cigarettes, interactions with tobacco/e-cigarette\nretailers, exposure to e-cigarette marketing, and combined substance use, as well as whether these factors differ\nacross neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics using participatory mapping and focus groups. Finally,\nin Aim 3, I will leverage a natural experiment in tobacco regulation across three Florida counties to assess\nwhether T21+TRL is more effective in reducing youth ENDS use and marketing exposure than T21 alone using\nquasi-experimental methods \u2013 comparative interrupted time series and difference-in-differences analysis.\nDr. Zinzi Bailey is an Assistant Scientist in the Jay Weiss Institute for Health Equity at the Sylvester\nComprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\nWhile cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use has declined among American youth over time, use of\nelectronic cigarettes \u2013 or vaping \u2013 among youth has increased tremendously. The recent vaping-related acute\nlung injuries and deaths as well as the first animal studies linking vaping to cancer have highlighted the need to\nrespond to e-cigarette use among youth.\nIn Aim 1, the project will assess the relationship between spatial density and proximity of tobacco/e-cigarette\nretailers around schools and county-level youth e-cigarette use and marketing exposure in Florida, overall and\nby county-level sociodemographic characteristics and racial/ethnic segregation. In Aim 2, it will qualitatively\nexplore where, how, why, and from whom youth access e-cigarettes, interactions with tobacco/e-cigarette\nretailers, exposure to e-cigarette marketing, and combined substance use, as well as whether these factors differ\nacross neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics using participatory mapping and focus groups. Finally,\nin Aim 3, I will leverage a natural experiment in tobacco regulation across three Florida counties to assess\nwhether T21+TRL is more effective in reducing youth ENDS use and marketing exposure than T21 alone using\nquasi-experimental methods \u2013 comparative interrupted time series and difference-in-differences analysis.\nDr. Zinzi Bailey is an Assistant Scientist in the Jay Weiss Institute for Health Equity at the Sylvester\nComprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. As a Black woman in\nacademia where Black women are underrepresented, Dr. Bailey seeks a K01 Mentored Research Scientist\nDevelopment Award to Promote Diversity to gain the skills, experience, and preliminary data needed for an\nindependent, policy-focused research program in translational cancer disparities research. Dr. Bailey will\nintegrate her background in social epidemiology and tobacco smoking behavior with methods and theories that\ncapture the socio-ecological complexity of tobacco regulation and its potential impact across communities.\nTo achieve this goal, Dr. Bailey proposes to gain the training and experience in policy analysis using quasi-\nexperimental designs, geographic information systems, and participatory research through mentorship,\ncoursework, workshops/seminars, and scientific meetings. Her career development objectives include (1)\nobtaining training in quasi-experimental designs for policy analysis, (2) advancing my expertise in assessing\nlocal, state, and federal tobacco policies and regulations, (3) receiving formal policy-relevant training in\ngeographic information systems (GIS) and spatial econometrics, and (4) developing methodological training on\nqualitative, participatory methods.\nThis study will lay the groundwork for a tobacco regulation-oriented research program that blends multiple\nmethods of policy analysis to guide the translation of disparities-focused research to evidence-based policy.",

Specific aims will reevaluate\nthe Hayflick Limit, assess mutational burden and the accumulation of transcriptional noise, test\nwhether a young host environment is responsible for maintaining everlasting functional\npersistence of transferred T cells, and evaluate metabolic adaptations that may support extreme\nlongevity and maintenance of proliferative potential.

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nT cell immunity may be exploited through vaccination, immunomodulating therapies, and\nengineered adoptive cell therapies to immunize against or control infections and cancer. However\nrepeated or prolonged stimulation can result in T cell dysfunction and senescence which impairs\nprotective immunity or allows disease progression. Establishing numerically robust, durable, and\nfunctional T cell immunity and preventing or reversing T cell exhaustion remain substantial goals\nin immunology that have significant clinical ramifications. Our preliminary data demonstrates that\nrepeated stimulation, even when punctuated by periods of rest, can result in senescence.\nHowever, we also show that this fate can be avoided, allowing indefinite boosting across multiple\nmouse lifetimes, while preserving function and durability. Additional preliminary data indicates\nthat T cells can adapt to become inured to exhaustion. The goals of this proposal are to determine\nthe underlying mechanisms that permit T cells to undergo indefinite clonal expansion while\navoiding functional exhaustion or proliferative senescence. Successful execution of the proposal\nwill inform our understanding of the regulation of immunological memory, vaccine development,\nand immune therapies for chronic diseases.\n.",

During tumor progression, the rapid\nproliferation of cancer cells creates a hypoxic microenvironment that inhibits the hydroxyproline-mediated\ndegradation of HIFa proteins and activates hypoxia-response cellular pathways to promote cancer cell survival\nin hypoxia. In addition to oxygen, the modification enzyme prolyl hydroxylases are also sensitive to the\nconcentration of iron and key mitochondria metabolites including succinate, fumarate, and alpha-ketoglutarate,\nmaking the pathway a critical metabolic sensor in cells. Extensive studies have demonstrated that proline\nhydroxylation regulates protein structural stability, protein-protein interactions, or proteasomal degradation of\nsubstrate proteins. Despite its important roles in cell physiology and success in the targeted analysis of\nindividual substrates, system-wide characterization and functional quantification of the pathway have been\nhindered by the lack of effective tools and strategies for site-specific identification of proline hydroxylation\ntargets.

    "abstract_text": "Project summary\nThis proposal seeks the acquisition of a LUMICKS C-Trap instrument at the University of Minnesota. The\nC-Trap is the only commercially available laser optical trap that combines TIRF fluorescence microscopy with\nintegrated microfluidics in a user-friendly, reliable, engineered instrument. Single molecule force and\nfluorescence spectroscopies have transformed the fields of cellular and molecular biology, biochemistry,\nbiophysics, and biomedical engineering, providing answers to crucial biological and health-related questions.\nThese tools are currently limited to laboratories with specialized expertise and custom-built single molecule\ninstruments. The C-Trap is designed as a turnkey system, enabling laboratories without specific single\nmolecule force or fluorescence spectroscopy expertise to conduct advanced single molecule force, position,\nand fluorescence localization, as well as FRET analysis, with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. Key\nfeatures of the C-Trap include dual optical traps for manipulating biomolecules with sub-pN force\nresolution/detection; 3-color laser TIRF and widefield fluorescence detection for visualizing biological\nprocesses; precise temperature control; micro and nano-stage control for exact sample positioning; laminar\nflow microfluidics for high sample throughput and varying ambient media while maintaining molecular\ninteractions; and user-friendly software for integrated, controlled, and automated instrument operation. The\nintuitive instrument and software interface, along with the automation package, will enable non-expert users to\nrun experiments and collect high-quality data with minimal training.\nThe proposal represents five major users (all with NIH R01/R35 funding) who will primarily use the instrument,\nand eight minor users with NIH or other funding. These users come from four colleges across University of\nMinnesota (College of Biological Sciences, College of Science and Engineering, School of Dentistry, and the\nMedical School) and six different departments. The C-Trap will significantly advance the NIH-funded projects of\nthese researchers by enabling high-impact single molecule mechanobiological and fluorescence studies on a\nrange of important biomedical questions in areas such as cell surface mechanosensing, muscular dystrophy\npathogenesis, cytoskeletal structure and dynamics, viral assembly and cell entry and nucleic acid processing.\nThe major users and technical advisors possess extensive relevant expertise with the technology, and will\nprovide guidance to all users. The instrument will be housed in the University Imaging Center, a Nikon Center\nof Excellence, which provides support and training for all of their instruments as well as expert advice and\nconsultation, from experiment planning to image acquisition and analysis. Establishing this resource will\nsignificantly enhance numerous research programs at the University of Minnesota and contribute to the\ndiscovery of impactful scientific, biomedical, and healthcare-related knowledge.",

We will build on our recent structural\nstudies of the Human T-cell Leukemia virus and Rous sarcoma virus intasomes and further investigate the\nroles of host factors during integration of these retroviruses. Another area that we are pursuing is the\nreplication of coronavirus RNA genomes and host cell invasion. In particular, we are interested in how a virally\nencoded exoribonuclease complex facilitates faithful replication of the large RNA genomes of coronaviruses,\nand how this unique proofreading activity could be modulated by small molecules. We are also investigating\ninhibition of the receptor binding of the coronavirus spike protein by novel antibodies and antibody-mimics.\nOverall, the studies proposed in this application will help better understand important RNA-based human\npathogens and could aid in the development of antiviral strategies, or alternatively, gene delivery tools useful in\nresearch or gene therapy applications.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT (Project 1)\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting over 10 million people world-\nwide. It can be a debilitating disorder and although studied for decades the physiological changes in the basal\nganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit that underlie its development remain under debate. Deep brain stimulation\n(DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal globus pallidus (GPi) has been a highly effective therapy\nfor many patients with PD, however, the results have been highly variable and may be associated with cognitive\ncompromise in some patients. To advance DBS therapies for PD we require a deeper understanding of the local\nand network-wide circuit dynamics and their relationship to motor signs and cognitive function. This\nunderstanding will provide the rationale for optimizing STN and GPi DBS, targeting specific regions within the\nSTN and GPi, and development of patient-specific DBS based on the patients\u2019 motor signs and cognitive profile.\nThe goals of this study are to advance our understanding of the role of BGTC (subcortical-cortical) and\ncortical-cortical circuits in the development of PD, the changes that occur with DBS and L-dopa, and to\nuse this understanding to advance current and develop new DBS approaches for its treatment. We will\ndefine the relationship between synchronized oscillations, coherence and connectivity within the broader BGTC\ncircuit (STN, GPi, sensory, motor, premotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices) to the development of PD motor\nsigns, define their role in motor performance (SA1,2), cognitive function (SA1,2,3), and corresponding changes\nwith DBS, L-dopa and DBS+L-dopa (SA2). By defining the strength and direction of connectivity patterns at rest\nand during movement we will characterize the role of individual circuits within the BGTC network and define their\nrespective roles in motor performance and cognitive function paving the way for future development of\noptimization algorithms for DBS that take advantage of this understanding (SA1,2,3,4). By correlating the degree\nof coherence between multiple single cells and local field potential (LFP) activity we will also advance our\nunderstanding of the role of spike-phase locking to the development of motor signs. Through high resolution\nimaging techniques and parcellation analyses we will define the optimal site for DBS within the STN and GPi\n(SA2,3,4) correlating motor and cognitive outcomes to biomarker activity and lead location, leading to patient-\nspecific DBS and development of automated programming algorithms based on each patient\u2019s phenotype and\nlead location. The proposed aims will be conducted using directional DBS leads, multiple independent current\ncontrolled (MICC) devices, high resolution imaging and electrophysiological recordings in PD patients with\nelectrocorticography (ECoG) arrays undergoing microelectrode mapping (SA1,3), postoperatively in patients\nwith ECoG arrays and externalized leads (SA2,3), and following optimization of DBS parameters (SA4).",

These recordings will be performed at rest and during cognitive-\nmotor tasks, with and without therapeutic interventions (DBS, L-dopa, DBS+L-dopa). It will also clarify the relative\neffect of stimulation in different functional subregions of the STN and GPi on motor and cognitive function.\nProject 2 (human) will explore the mechanisms and effects of pallidal DBS on levodopa resistant motor signs\nusing MRI-derived computational models and fMRI to examine the pathways mediating these changes. It will\nuse new sensing technology (Percept) to identify and correlate the physiological changes in the GP to worsening\nof, or improvement in, gait dysfunction. Project 3 (non-human primate) will examine the electrophysiological\nchanges in pallido\u2194peduncular, pallido\u2192intralaminar, and pallido\u2192habenular activity that are related to\ncognitive-motor symptoms providing further network-level insights into cognitive motor gait impairments, task\nshifting difficulties, and loss of motivation, which will complement the results from the human studies in Projects\n1 and 2. All center components have synergistic interactions with the Catalyst Project, which will support\nresearch efforts of a promising Early Stage Investigator who will use a novel closed-loop DBS approach to probe\ncircuit dynamics in PD patients and their relationship to PD motor signs. The Imaging Core will acquire state-\nof-the-art, high-field structural MRI as well as rest and task-based fMRI for PD patients in Projects 1 and 2 (using\n7T scanner) and structural MRI for the NHPs in Project 3 (using the first of its kind 10.5T scanner).The Clinical\nCore will obtain clinical and quantitative motor and neuropsychological assessments that will be correlated to\nphysiological data obtained acutely in the operating room, subacutely in patients with externalized DBS leads\nand electrocorticography arrays, and chronically through postoperative recordings using Percept.

Data will be collected during both rest and movement, on and off L-dopa and\non L-dopa during drug-induced dyskinesia.

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nWe wish to understand how immunotherapy-induced neurotoxicity occurs. Neurotoxicity is the most pernicious\nside effect of several immunotherapies for B-cell leukemias and lymphomas, including CAR T-cell therapy. In\nthe latter approach, a sample of the patient\u2019s own T-cells are removed, genetically engineered to recognize B-\ncell tumors, expanded to large numbers, and then reinfused into the patient. The genetically engineered tumor-\nrecognition component is a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CARs reprogram T-cells to recognize and kill\ntumor cells, regardless of the T-cell\u2019s innate specificity. CAR T-cells specific for the B-cell-associated antigen\nCD19 can induce durable complete remissions in patients with otherwise terminal B-cell malignancies. Like\nany therapy, though, it has side-effects. CD19-specific CAR T-cells frequently cause a spectrum of\nneurological adverse effects (NAE) ranging from disorientation to death. They cannot be prevented or treated\nadequately because their pathophysiology is poorly understood. To that end, we developed a novel, immune-\ncompetent humanized mouse model that replicates the anti-tumor efficacy and toxicities (including NAE)\ncaused clinically by CD19-specific CAR T-cells. In our model, mouse B-cells express a human CD19\ntransgene (hCD19Tg). Transfer of mouse T-cells \u2013 called CART19 cells - that express a hCD19-specific CAR\ninto hCD19Tg mice cause NAEs that are very similar to those experienced clinically. Because our findings\nmirror clinical reports, we suggest the causes of CART19-induced murine NAE will extrapolate to patients\ntreated with CD19-specific CAR T-cells. Our central hypothesis is that blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption\nfollowing CART19 infusion permits leukocytes, fluids, and systemic cytokines to enter the central nervous\nsystem (CNS). Here these systemic cytokines, and to a greater extent cytokines produced in the CNS by\nCART19 cells, activate resident microglial cells and extravasated myeloid cells. The differentiation of both into\nproinflammatory cells ultimately causes NAE. We propose two aims to test these hypotheses. The first aim will\nreveal what causes BBB dysfunction while the second aim will determine what drives NAE. We will learn how\nCART19 cells cross the BBB and if their persistent activation in the CNS contributes to or drives NAE. Using\ngenetic, immunological, and pharmacological methods, we also will assess the contributions of resident and\nextravasated peripheral myeloid cells and specific cytokines to NAE. Finally, we will assess how NAE affects\ngene and protein expression by brain parenchymal cells using single cell approaches. Our proposed project\nwill significantly impact two areas: 1) basic research in CNS pathobiology as it relates to NAE and 2)\ntranslational research as it relates to improving CD19-specific CAR T-cell therapy for human B-cell\nmalignancies.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies have dramatically shifted the treatment paradigm for many\npatients with cancer. Broader use of autologous CAR-T cell therapies, however, is hindered by complicated\nlogistics, variable quality, T cell exhaustion, antigen escape and on-target/off-tumor effects and other toxicities,\nlike CRS. The broad objective is to address these issues by the development of a safe and effective off-the-\nshelf cell therapy. To accomplish this, we propose a different cellular vehicle, specifically Regulatory T Cells\n(Tregs). Advantages of Tregs include (a) an inherent ability to suppress the release of proinflammatory\ncytokines and host mediated allogeneic rejection, and (b) proliferative capacity for large-scale expansion and\ngenetic engineering, ideal characteristics of an allogeneic immune effector cell (IEC) therapeutic. Based on the\nsafety and efficacy profile of third party Tregs previously tested in phase I/II trials for prevention of graft-versus-\nhost disease (GVHD), and their tumoricidal potency in preclinical models, this strategy addresses some of the\ngrand challenges facing allogeneic IECs. During the current funding period, in proof of concept studies, we\ndemonstrated the tumoricidal activity of Treg expressing CARs targeting CD19+ and CD83+ hematological\nmalignancies. Our central hypothesis is that allogeneic Tregs can be engineered for enhanced persistence\nand maximal tumor killing with reduced risks of adverse side effects compared to conventional T cells.\nSpecifically, we will establish the safety profile of CAR19 Tregs at the maximal tolerable dose without and with\nrhIL-2 in patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ acute lymphocytic leukemia (Aim 1A, Aim 1B), assessing in\nvivo pharmacokinetics and persistence as well as tumoricidal activity. To avoid the potential side effects of\nsystemic rhIL-2 and avoid bystander activation, we will engineer CAR19 Tregs to express an orthoIL2R\u03b2\nresponsive to orthoIL-2 to maximize persistence and tumor killing (Aim 1C). In Aim 2, we will test the potency\nof nanoCAR Tregs targeting CD83 on AML cells and not myeloid progenitors (Aim 2A). Additionally, to\nminimize Treg exhaustion from tonic stimulation as well as enhance safety, Tregs will be engineered with a\ndrug inducible CAR permitting control over its activation (Aim 2B). These IND enabling studies will support\nfuture clinical testing. IMPACT. The availability of safer and more effective allogeneic \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 tTreg IECs\nwould address a critical unmet need, overcoming some of the principal limitations of individualized products.\n1",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nImmune effector cells (IECs) targeting tumor associated antigens, such as with chimeric antigen receptors\n(CARs) and bi- and tri- specific antibodies, offer unprecedented results in patients previously considered\nincurable. The number of cellular immunotherapies for solid tumors and hematological malignancies has\ndramatically increased. CAR T cells are now being considered early in the patient\u2019s treatment plan as in children\nwith CD19+ acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), no longer reserved for salvage therapy. However, as experience\ngrows, a number of issues need to be addressed urgently. The grand challenges of adoptive IEC therapy include:\non-target/off-tumor toxicities, T cell exhaustion, tumor escape by antigen loss, immunosuppressive tumor\nmicroenvironment, variable persistence, and time and cost of individualized product manufacture, limiting global\naccess. To this end, there are 5 important research themes woven throughout the 3 Projects and 4 Cores,\nspecifically, 1) the need for safe and effective allogeneic off-the-shelf IECs, 2) IECs that can target multiple tumor\nantigens to minimize tumor escape, 3) development of drug regulatable CARs for greater control, limiting on-\ntarget/off-tumor adverse effects and T cell exhaustion, 4) more selective cytokine stimulation to enhance IEC\npersistence and potency with minimal systemic side effects, and 5) translation of new engineering methods for\nindustrial-scale manufacturing. During the current funding period, there have been key discoveries that will drive\nthe next 5 years of this grant, specifically: the finding that (a) Tregs are effective cancer IECs which can be\nengineered to effectively target and kill cancer comparable to conventional T cells, (b) ability to generate iPSC-\nderived CD8 iTregs as a renewable starting cell source, readily amenable to genetic engineering and ex vivo\nexpansion, (c) iPSC-derived NK cells engineered to express a high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16a (hnCD16) and\nmembrane-bound IL-15/IL-15R without expression of CD38 enhances in vivo persistence and NK fitness and\npermits use of anti-CD38 antibody for in vivo depletion of regulatory cells, (d) the construction of antibodies that\nengage multiple targets, i.e. NK cells and tumor cells, with a stimulatory cytokine increase anti-tumor efficacy,\nand, (e) large scale IEC manufacturing, providing 100s to 1000s of cell doses, is possible. These discoveries will\nbe further optimized and tested in relevant model systems in support of clinical translation. Project 1 will test\nthe hypothesis that engineered allogeneic CD4 Tregs can be engineered to express synthetic stimulatory\nreceptors and drug inducible CARs for maximum safety and reduced risk of exhaustion. Project 2 we will test\nthe hypothesis that off-the-shelf CD83 CAR iPSC CD8 iTregs can be engineered to avoid rejection and\nexhaustion but retain potent tumoricidal activity against AML. And, Project 3 will test the hypothesis that the\ncombination of iNK genetic engineering and antigen specific targeting with TriKEs and CARs will enhance\nspecificity, potency, persistence for maximal AML killing.",

    "abstract_text": "The broad objective of the Administrative and Clinical Research Support Core is to provide essential\nadministrative and clinical research support for the Projects and other Cores fundamental to the success of this\nProgram Project Grant. The administrative components of the Core focus on accounting, budgeting, regulatory\nreporting and, most importantly, fostering team science by providing multiple opportunities for communication\nbetween project and core investigators, external collaborators and the External Advisory Board members. Core\nA will also facilitate clinical trial activation and execution and protocol specific training for the faculty and\nresearch staff as well as nurse coordinators and advance practice providers working in the inpatient and\noutpatient clinical units to maximize trial safety and integrity. To accomplish our objective, there are 4 specific\naims: Aim 1: Scientific Oversight is focused on facilitating communication between investigators in projects\nand cores, arranging annual retreats for the Program\u2019s team and annual meetings with an External Advisory\nBoard, composed of 4 renowned experts in the field of immune effector cellular therapy, and other key leaders\nin the field on an ad hoc basis. The Programs\u2019 leaders will continually seek areas of collaboration within and\noutside the Program with investigators with expertise. Aim 2: Administrative and Financial Support is focused\non general accounting and fiscal support associated with the grant overall and individual projects and cores,\nand assistance in the completion of progress reports. Aim 3: Clinical Oversight and Services is focused on\nproviding the support staff necessary for the preparation of clinical protocols and applications to regulatory\nbodies, maintenance of clinical protocols, regulatory assistance for IND submissions and reporting, and\nmanagement of audits by internal and external agencies, and trial monitoring. Core A is also be responsible for\ndevelopment of data management plans, case report forms and patient study treatment calendars, as well as\nthe collection of data from each of the clinical units, meeting the data management agreements with our clinical\npartner, MHealth-Fairview. Aim 4: Faculty and Staff Education is focused on enhancing staff and faculty\neducation in the rapidly evolving field of cell, gene and immunotherapy. This will be accomplished through\nstanding seminars and grand rounds and other clinical program meetings. Here, we bring in outside leaders in\nthe field to present seminars and meet with senior and junior faculty and trainees, often leading to new\ncollaborations, magnifying our successes in translational medicine. Aim 5: Enrollment Optimization and\nEnhanced Subject Education is novel unique approach for predicting and enhancing patient accrual and\nsubject understanding in support of the proposed clinical trials. These tools developed by investigators at the\nUniversity of Minnesota identify barriers to accrual and subject understanding, permitting interventions prior to\ntrial initiation. The long-term objective is the rapid and safe translation of allogeneic immune effector cell\ntherapies in the treatment of cancer that more effectively target and kill tumor cells with fewer adverse effects.",

The CPRC, ISC teams, and CTO SLT are responsible for \nreviewing all hypothesis-driven protocols involving human subjects with cancer or at risk of developing cancer. \nThe goals of these committees are to ensure that studies are feasible and have scientific merit. \nProtocol review takes place in 2 stages. First, the disease-specific ISC team evaluates the study to ensure \naccrual goals are feasible, competing trials have been addressed, adequate funding is in place, and study \nprioritization is considered (IIT > cooperative group > industry). In July 2022, the CTO SLT was added to the \nfeasibility review process to provide a review of CTO staffing and to grant final approval of feasibility. The CTO \nSLT review was added to satisfy a new mandate by the Dean of the Medical School for a Departmental Clinical \nResearch Resource Review (CR3). Prior to the Medical School implementing the CR3 process, the CPRC sent \na feasibility review form to ISC Team Chairs for completion prior to the CPRC meeting. \nIn the second stage of review, the CPRC reviews scientific quality and merit. The CPRC reviews the adequacy \nof the objectives, treatment plan, study justification, statistical plan, data and safety monitoring plan, and \naccrual goals. Protocols must receive CPRC approval or stipulated approval with permission to proceed with \nthe Institutional Review Board application and submission. \nThe CPRC is also responsible for continuing review of scientific progress and accrual throughout a trial\u2019s \nenrollment period. The CPRC may disapprove or close a study for lack of scientific or accrual progress. Annual \nreview of all CPRC-approved studies begins 1 year after the initial CPRC approval date. The annual accrual \nminimum has been increased to 35% of the projected goal. If a protocol does not meet the accrual threshold, if \nscientific merit is in question, or if there has been a delay in study activation, a letter is sent to the PI requesting \njustification. \nThe CPRC is composed of members with scientific expertise in solid tumors, hematology, blood and marrow \ntransplant, pediatrics, epidemiology, pharmacology, and cancer prevention and control to encompass the \nportfolio of research conducted at the MCC. Co-Chairs of the committee are appointed by MCC Executive \nLeadership. The ISC teams are composed of faculty and staff representatives from disease specific disciplines \nwho currently serve as treating physicians, Advanced Practice Providers (APP), or study staff within that \ndisease portfolio.

In \nthe past 5 years, several other leadership positions have been modified or added to meet the changing needs \nof the MCC. A new Associate Director position has been created to provide oversight of Diversity, Equity, and \nInclusion (DEI) and leadership as the MCC implements its plan to enhance participation of women, minorities, \nand underrepresented groups in the Center\u2019s workforce and leadership. The Associate Director for Basic \nSciences now oversees the Basic Shared Resources, and the Associate Director for Clinical Affairs is now the \nAssociate Director for Clinical Research, overseeing all clinical research functions of the Center, including the \nClinical Trials Office and other clinical research resources. New recruits have filled the positions of Associate \nDirectors of Administration, Basic Sciences, Clinical Research, Community Outreach and Engagement, \nEducation, and Translational Research. \nSince the last competitive renewal, MCC undertook an extensive strategic planning process, which culminated \nin the release of a refreshed 5-year Strategic Plan in 2022 driven by 3 elements central to the mission and \nvision of the Center: 1) Engage in the research strengths of MCC research members, 2) Enhance integration of \nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion across the center, 3) Proactively develop and retain the next generation of new \nleadership, faculty and staff, 4) Incorporate catchment and care provider input into MCC activities. \nThe overall goal was to ensure that these elements of the Center\u2019s mission and vision are embedded \nthroughout the Plan. Therefore, governance structures, evaluation metrics, and associated resources were \nrevised to align with each area of the Plan. As a result of this process, 4 strategic pillars and areas for a \ncascading strategic plan were formulated based on a combination of stakeholder interviews, comprehensive \nreviews of previous strategic plans, ecosystem partner objectives, an inventory of current state activities, and \nfuture state objectives. Those 4 pillars are: Reduce the Cancer Burden in Minnesota and beyond, Drive \nResearch Discovery, Accelerate the Path to Cures, and Enable Research Excellence. \nMCC will continue to receive input from its External Advisory Board annually and will leverage institutional \nleadership and engage key stakeholders in support of the Center\u2019s Aims to 1) Guide cancer research at the \nUniversity of Minnesota, 2) Provide vision and oversight for the MCC Strategic Plan, and 3) Evaluate progress \nand adjust our efforts accordingly to achieve the mission, vision, and goals of MCC.",

    "abstract_text": "In 2010 we treated our first patient with advanced ovarian cancer (OC) with intravenous (IV) allogeneic NK cells.\nSince then, we have worked to improve the persistence and function of NK cells in this disease. Based on our\npre-clinical findings, we designed and completed a clinical trial testing the safety and efficacy of ex vivo expanded\n(IL-15 + GSK3b inhibitor) adaptive NK cells administered intraperitoneally (IP) to treat OC. These allogeneic NK\ncells persisted and had enhanced in vivo function for up to 21 days with promising clinical responses. These\ninitial results support improved NK cell persistence with IP versus IV delivery and NK cell-mediated antitumor\neffects in advanced OC. The overarching hypothesis for Project 3 is that IP delivery of NK cells will be optimal\nfor clinical testing of NK cells gene modified to target OC through their Fc receptors. We will test an off-the-shelf\nNK cell product that resists CD16 cleavage (hnCD16) in combination with IL-2 and an Fc-optimized mAb against\nB7-H3, a target highly expressed on OC. We predict this NK product will overcome suppressive mechanisms\nand mediate potent anti-tumor activity and that targeting these cells with specific killer immune engagers\ncontaining IL-15 will enhance their specificity to kill OC. These studies are supported by strong pre-clinical data\nshowing high NK cell frequencies with markedly diminished CD16 expression in ascites from OC patients. The\ninduced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NK (iNK) cell product (FT516) proposed for use in this project has\nnon-cleavable CD16 to sustain antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) when combined with an Fc\noptimized anti-B7-H3 antibody. To further enhance the antitumor efficacy of FT516 NK cells, we will test our own\nIL-15-containing Trispecific Killer Engagers: 1) a 1615B7H3 TriKE comprised of three functional domains: a) an\nNK cell-engaging single domain Ab fragment against CD16, b) an OC-engaging Ab fragment against B7-H3, and\nc) an IL-15 linker between them; 2) a 1615CD133 TriKE to target OC stem cells; and 3) a 1615CD133B7H3\nTriKE for dual targeting of OC cells. Lastly, supported by strong pre-clinical data, we developed a CD64/CD16\nchimeric receptor, as CD64 is the only high-affinity receptor that can stably bind monomeric IgG with >30-fold\nhigher affinity than CD16. This novel receptor has been genetically edited into iPSC-derived NK cells and will be\ntested in vitro and in xenogeneic mouse models of OC. We have developed Specific Aims to 1) clinically test\nwhether IP delivery of FT516 iNK cells combined with enoblituzumab (anti B7-H3 antibody) will enhance efficacy\nthrough ADCC in advanced OC; 2) pre-clinically test whether single- or dual-targeted TriKEs will enhance the\nantitumor efficacy of FT516 NK cells; and 3) pre-clinically test whether multi-antibody targeting by iNK cells\nexpressing the chimeric CD64/16A receptor will enhance function. The themes developed in Project 3 will inform\nthe Program on whether delivery of an off-the-shelf NK cell product directly into the peritoneal cavity, an\nenvironment that may evade immune attack, can enhance tumor control. Results from these studies will inform\nProjects 1 and 2 on the mechanisms of rejection versus the intrinsic capacity of NK cells to persist in vivo.",

Prior to the Medical School implementing the CR3 process, the CPRC sent \na feasibility review form to ISC Team Chairs for completion prior to the CPRC meeting. \nIn the second stage of review, the CPRC reviews scientific quality and merit. The CPRC reviews the adequacy \nof the objectives, treatment plan, study justification, statistical plan, data and safety monitoring plan, and \naccrual goals. Protocols must receive CPRC approval or stipulated approval with permission to proceed with \nthe Institutional Review Board application and submission. \nThe CPRC is also responsible for continuing review of scientific progress and accrual throughout a trial\u2019s \nenrollment period. The CPRC may disapprove or close a study for lack of scientific or accrual progress. Annual \nreview of all CPRC-approved studies begins 1 year after the initial CPRC approval date. The annual accrual \nminimum has been increased to 35% of the projected goal. If a protocol does not meet the accrual threshold, if \nscientific merit is in question, or if there has been a delay in study activation, a letter is sent to the PI requesting \njustification. \nThe CPRC is composed of members with scientific expertise in solid tumors, hematology, blood and marrow \ntransplant, pediatrics, epidemiology, pharmacology, and cancer prevention and control to encompass the \nportfolio of research conducted at the MCC. Co-Chairs of the committee are appointed by MCC Executive \nLeadership. The ISC teams are composed of faculty and staff representatives from disease specific disciplines \nwho currently serve as treating physicians, Advanced Practice Providers (APP), or study staff within that \ndisease portfolio. The CTO SLT is composed of senior MCC and CTO leadership.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT: PROJECT 3\nOver the last several decades, it has become possible to isolate a patient\u2019s own cells, engineer and expand them\nin the laboratory, and use them to treat an existing cancer. This technology has largely advanced to using primary\nhuman T cells genetically modified to express a tumor specific T cell receptor (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptor\n(CAR). This approach has demonstrated durable cures in some leukemias, but has had limited success in the\ntreatment of solid tumors. This lack of efficacy is believed to be due to challenges faced by T cells in migrating\ninto and within complex solid tumor microenvironments and multiple immunosuppressive modalities found there.\nAs many of these challenges have been identified and mechanistically studied, we hypothesize that we can\nengineer CAR T cells capable of overcoming all challenges found in the solid tumor microenvironment, leading\nto durable cures for cancer patients with the worst prognosis. Recently, a number of groups have published high\nefficiency methods for engineering T cells using CRISPR/Cas9. Moreover, the use of recombinant adeno\nassociated virus (rAAV) as a DNA donor molecule for homologous recombination (HR) combined with Cas9 has\nalso demonstrated incredible rates of site-specific gene delivery in T cells. Although these approaches are highly\neffective, there are still drawbacks and issues to be resolved to improve capabilities and safety of gene editing\ncells for therapy. For instance, nuclease-based gene editing still relies on stochastic repair of genotoxic double\nstrand breaks (DSBs) with little uniformity in the editing outcome. Fortunately, new technologies have emerged\nto gene edit DNA at single base pair resolution with high product purity and efficiency and without a targeted\nDSB, termed Cas9 base editors (BEs) and primer editors (PEs). We have demonstrated that this technology\nallows for highly efficient multiplex genome editing via programmable enzymatic single base changes without\ncreating toxic DSBs, i.e. \u201cdigital editing\u201d. As this technology is relatively new, there is also opportunity to develop\nnew and innovative genome editing strategies to develop fully digitally edited cells intended for therapeutic use\nin a cost effect, rapid, and accurate manner. Thus, our specific aims are as follows: 1) Further develop multiplex\ndigital editing in murine and human T cells and explore novel uses for digital editing, 2) Deploy multiplex digital\nediting to install novel edits in order to enhance T cells migration into and within mechanically complex tumor\nmicroenvironment and also hardwire T cells to maintain a T resident memory phenotype, 3) Implement digital\nediting to develop \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d T cells with enhanced solid tumor efficacy via digital knockout of all 3 NUR4A\ntranscription factor family. In summary, by deploying digital editing, we will make gene editing of cells intended\nfor therapeutic use more sophisticated, safe and lead to effective therapies against solid tumor tumors with\nmechanically complex and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments.",

Third party targeted therapeutic Immune Effector Cell (IEC) interventions are\nbound to change the way we treat AML and ALL. NK cell products hold promise because of their ability to quickly\nkill tumor cells without causing graft versus host disease (GVHD). Similarly, tolerance inducing regulatory T cells\n(Tregs) are a T cell population with cytolytic as well as tolerance induction potential. Furthermore, in the\nallogeneic setting, Tregs suppress GVHD and graft rejection. This grant focuses on clinical implementation of\nnovel Treg and NK targeted therapeutics in AML and ALL, as well as development of novel CAR-iTregs and\nCAR-iNKs. An overarching hypothesis of this PPG is that allogeneic Treg and NK cell immunotherapies can be\nengineered to maximize successful leukemia control with decreased toxicity, when compared to conventional T\ncell immunotherapy approaches. To that end, Core C will provide seamless sample processing and state-of-the-\nart assays to best inform the projects on how IEC cell interventions work in the clinic and help assess how novel\nIEC products perform pre-clinically. The Core integrates the processing, storage/annotation, distribution, and\nanalytic capabilities of the Translational Therapy Laboratory, an NCI funded Cancer Center Support Grant\nshared resource, with a number of novel techniques to gain deep understanding of Treg and NK cell biology, the\nimmune landscape influencing and resulting from IEC intervention, and the tumor microenvironment (TME) the\nIEC cell interventions must operate in. Mass cytometry, CyTOF, will be used to phenotypically evaluate IEC\nproducts and immune reconstitution at a high level of detail.

Since the time of the first award in 1997,\nthere has been growth of the membership and research base. In our original application, there were 89\nmembers; this has increased to 245 members from 49 departments and 11 colleges and schools of the\nUniversity of Minnesota.

In \nthe past 5 years, several other leadership positions have been modified or added to meet the changing needs \nof the MCC. A new Associate Director position has been created to provide oversight of Diversity, Equity, and \nInclusion (DEI) and leadership as the MCC implements its plan to enhance participation of women, minorities, \nand underrepresented groups in the Center\u2019s workforce and leadership. The Associate Director for Basic \nSciences now oversees the Basic Shared Resources, and the Associate Director for Clinical Affairs is now the \nAssociate Director for Clinical Research, overseeing all clinical research functions of the Center, including the \nClinical Trials Office and other clinical research resources. New recruits have filled the positions of Associate \nDirectors of Administration, Basic Sciences, Clinical Research, Community Outreach and Engagement, \nEducation, and Translational Research. \nSince the last competitive renewal, MCC undertook an extensive strategic planning process, which culminated \nin the release of a refreshed 5-year Strategic Plan in 2022 driven by 3 elements central to the mission and \nvision of the Center: 1) Engage in the research strengths of MCC research members, 2) Enhance integration of \nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion across the center, 3) Proactively develop and retain the next generation of new \nleadership, faculty and staff, 4) Incorporate catchment and care provider input into MCC activities. \nThe overall goal was to ensure that these elements of the Center\u2019s mission and vision are embedded \nthroughout the Plan. Therefore, governance structures, evaluation metrics, and associated resources were \nrevised to align with each area of the Plan. As a result of this process, 4 strategic pillars and areas for a \ncascading strategic plan were formulated based on a combination of stakeholder interviews, comprehensive \nreviews of previous strategic plans, ecosystem partner objectives, an inventory of current state activities, and \nfuture state objectives. Those 4 pillars are: Reduce the Cancer Burden in Minnesota and beyond, Drive \nResearch Discovery, Accelerate the Path to Cures, and Enable Research Excellence. \nMCC will continue to receive input from its External Advisory Board annually and will leverage institutional \nleadership and engage key stakeholders in support of the Center\u2019s Aims to 1) Guide cancer research at the \nUniversity of Minnesota, 2) Provide vision and oversight for the MCC Strategic Plan, and 3) Evaluate progress \nand adjust our efforts accordingly to achieve the mission, vision, and goals of MCC.",

Our Aims align with the Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) \nStrategic Plan pillars of driving research discoveries and accelerating the path to cures: 1) Identify basic \nmechanisms of immune cell regulation and function in the context of cancer and other chronic disease states \nthat form the foundation for immune-mediated clinical interventions. 2) Develop, implement, and optimize \ncancer immunotherapies for clinical application. \nYoji Shimizu, PhD, and Jeffrey Miller, MD, co-lead the IMM Program. Dr. Shimizu's expertise is in basic \nimmunology and Dr. Miller's is in translational immunology; these synergize to accelerate the development and \noptimization of cancer immunotherapies to realize the full potential of immunotherapy for cancer patients. \nThe IMM Program has 29 members, representing 11 departments and 3 schools or colleges. For the last \nbudget year, these members were supported by $13.1 million in cancer-relevant research funding (direct \ncosts), of which $1.85 million was from the National Cancer Institute. The Program's scientific \naccomplishments over the past 5 years include new insights into resident memory T cells and the development \nof a novel cancer clinical immunotherapy that targets them, the optimization and clinical testing of trispecific \nengagers that specifically activate NK cells, an expanding NCI-funded program focused on developing \napproaches to overcome the resistance of pancreatic cancer to immunotherapy by targeting both T cells and \nmyeloid cells, a preclinical mouse model to address the mechanism that leads to neurotoxicity during CAR T \ncell therapy, and multiple approaches for optimizing and enhancing current cancer immunotherapies. Since \n2018, Program members have published 349 papers, 24% of which resulted from intraprogrammatic \ncollaborations, 35% from interprogrammatic collaborations, and 57% from external collaborations. \nMCC adds substantial value, such as the Cancer Research Translational Initiative, which allows IMM Program \nmembers to continue to move fundamental, high-impact scientific discoveries directly into cancer models and \nthen on to clinical application. Program members also make extensive use of MCC Shared Resources and \nactively participate in Translational Working Groups. MCC-supported Program meetings and events foster our \nbasic research and translational activities, and Program members are actively involved in community outreach \nand engagement activities, particularly those that focus on education and clinical trial enrollment.",

    "abstract_text": "During the last 2.5 decades, I have led clinical efforts to develop novel NK cell immunotherapy strategies to treat\ncancer by advancing lab-based discoveries in the areas of natural killer (NK) cell and IL-15 biology. This work\nhas been supported by a continuously funded and recently renewed NCI P01 (CA111412) grant, now in its 21st\nyear of funding (through 2026). This P01 will serve as the clinical output for the translational work proposed in\nthis R35 application. An R35 award will allow me to further pivot my research program to focus on solid tumors.\nI started a long-standing NK Cell Program at the University of Minnesota that now includes a team of basic and\ntranslational scientists interested in NK cell immunotherapy. My research group has found that exposure to\ncytomegalovirus (CMV) induces a population of NK cells with potent immune and anti-tumor function that are\nmarked by the expression of the NKG2C activating receptor that recognizes HLA-E, which is overexpressed on\nmany solid tumor cancers. Our highest impact research during the past 5 years is based on an induced\npluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NK cell platform designed with attributes of naturally occurring CMV-induced\nadaptive NK cells. This iPSC platform allows an unlimited number of iPSC gene edits to be performed at the\nclonal level for mechanistic studies that will be translated into clinical trials. I have used my expertise in NK cell\ndevelopment to help develop methods for directed differentiation of iPSCs to the NK cell lineage (termed iNK) at\nclinical scale to generate fully functional NK cells for immunotherapy. These iNK cells will be multiplex engineered\nto enhance tumor-specific activity and persistence in a hostile \u201ccold\u201d tumor environment. My team, who pioneered\nadoptive transfer of allogeneic NK cells in 2005, has the most experience worldwide, having infused >400\nhaploidentical NK cell products to treat patients with cancer. We have now made a complete transition away\nfrom individual donor blood cell products because of their variability, barriers to gene editing, high cost, and\ndifficulty exporting to the cancer community. The overarching goal of this R35 OIA is to develop novel\nstrategies to specifically target solid tumor malignancies by testing new iPSC edits that facilitate homing and\nmigration, overcome hypoxia, and promote survival after adoptive transfer in patients with solid tumor\nmalignancies. To enhance the specificity and anti-tumoral activity of our iNK cells, we have developed a camelid\nnanobody specific for B7-H3 that serves as the engager of a novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). We have\nchosen to further study the anti-tumor function of these new CAR iNK cells against two solid tumors (glioblastoma\nand prostate cancer) that demonstrate oncogenic dependence on the expression of B7-H3. B7-H3 is not\nexpressed at the protein level in normal tissues. We will also compare these CAR iNK cells using the same CAR\nedited into an iPSC-derived T cell (termed iT). The impact of these investigations is to develop novel off-the-\nshelf immune cell therapies with potential to change standards of cancer care.",

    "abstract_text": "Recent high-profile advances have reinvigorated enthusiasm for immunologic and cell-based therapies for\ncancer. While the first 15 years of this Program focused on related donor sourced products and defining the\nimmunogenetics of NK cell contributions to allotransplantation, the adoptive transfer of single donor products is\nlimited to specialty centers because of high cost, difficulty in exporting, and inability to test multi-dosing strategies.\nWe have formed new strategic partnerships to shift from single donor products to off-the-shelf approaches. This\napproach is simpler for protein-based NK cell immune engagers, as they are readily druggable, but more\nchallenging for cell products. Therefore, our overall goal is to develop off-the-shelf NK cell products to be used\nalone or in combination with novel immune engagers. We have assembled a team of Minnesota and international\nexperts to lead the Projects and Cores. In Project 1, we discovered that NKG2C+ adaptive NK cells induced by\nCMV have properties of immune memory, exhibit a unique methylation signature similar to CD8+ T cells, and are\nprimed for anti-tumor activity. Our group also published the 1st clinical link between adaptive NK cells and\nreduced rates of leukemia relapse in 2016. We will now conduct a multi-institutional phase I/II trial of allogeneic\nKIR-HLA mismatched adaptive NK cell infusions to treat patients with AML/MDS. We will also perform preclinical\ntesting of off-the-shelf NK cell products and novel immune engagers called tri-specific killer engagers (TriKEs).\nTriKEs contain 3 arms: an arm that engages the CD16 activating receptor on NK cells; an arm that specifically\nengages a tumor antigen on cancer cells; and an IL-15 linker. In the current funding, we discovered that IL-15 is\nsuperior to IL-2 in promoting in vivo NK persistence and expansion; however, it also stimulates host CD8+ T cells\nin many subjects, and we will test whether IL-15\u2019s targeted delivery via TriKE minimizes bystander T cell\nactivation. Project 2 will focus on NHL and clinically test a dual-targeted strategy using an off-the-shelf, iPSC-\nderived NK (iNK) cell product containing a CAR against CD19, a CD16 receptor, and membrane bound IL-15.\nPreclinically, we will test whether targeting NK cell metabolism can improve in vivo NK cell performance. Project\n3 will extend off-the-shelf iNK cell therapies into a solid tumor setting. Initial testing of adaptive NK cells in ovarian\ncancer showed that the intraperitoneal (\nIP) space is immune privileged and allows for NK cell persistence. We\nwill conduct a phase I clinical trial to determine whether IP delivery of off-the-shelf iNK cells expressing a non-\ncleavable CD16 (FT516)\nimproves outcomes among patients with ovarian cancer.\nPreclinically, we will test novel\nimmune engagers (TriKEs) in combination with FT516 and a new iNK cell product expressing a chimeric\nCD64/16A receptor capable of multi-antibody targeting. Projects will be supported by the Administration &\nClinical Research Support (Core A), Biostatistics (Core B), and Immune Monitoring & Tissue Analysis (Core C)\nresources. This Program will build upon our success in establishing a signal of clinical efficacy with single-donor\nNK cells by moving from individually sourced related donor products to multi-dosed, off-the-shelf strategies.",

    "abstract_text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clinically heterogeneous disease characterized by the expansion and\naccumulation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Advances in the AML genetics\nhave led to a better understanding of disease progression, paving the way for the development of novel targeted\ntherapies. Still, the mainstay of AML treatment is chemotherapy, which has remained mostly unchanged for\nseveral decades, and fewer than one-third of adult AML patients experience a durable remission. Reduced-\nintensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for AML is potentially curative, but relapse rates exceed\n50%. We have shown that allogeneic natural killer (NK) cell infusions after high-dose lymphodepletion (LD) can\ninduce remission in 30-40% of patients with relapsed/refractory AML. However, this approach is limited by the\ntoxicity of high-dose LD, NK cell numbers within haploidentical blood products, inadequate donor NK cell\npersistence, lack of NK cell antigen specificity, allogeneic rejection and challenges of exporting adoptive NK cell\ntherapy beyond specialty centers. To overcome these barriers, we have developed a scalable GMP-compliant\nplatform for the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into highly potent NK cells (termed iNK).\nWith our system, we can generate stable gene-edited lines for tailored approaches to NK cell immunotherapy.\nIn the past year, we have safely treated patients with up to 6 cryopreserved doses of off-the-shelf iNK cell\nproducts. In this project we will test the central hypothesis that triple gene-modified iNK cells (FT538) represent\na novel and effective immunotherapy for the treatment of AML. FT538 is a cell product with three functional\nmodifications: a high affinity, non-cleavable CD16 Fc receptor to augment antibody-dependent cellular\ncytotoxicity; a membrane-bound IL-15/IL-15 receptor fusion molecule (IL-15RF) that acts intrinsically to enhance\nNK cell activity; and knockout of CD38 to mitigate NK cell fratricide in the presence of the anti-CD38 monoclonal\nantibody, daratumumab. The central hypothesis will be tested in three independent aims. In Aim 1, we will test\nthe hypothesis that FT538 iNK cells will exhibit sustained persistence and function after adoptive transfer for\ntargeting of CD38+ AML cells when combined with daratumumab in an FDA-approved and enrolling phase I\nclinical trial. Because CD38 is highly expressed on AML, immune suppressor cells, and activated CD8+ T cells,\nour clinical trial will test whether daratumumab dosing before FT538 iNK cell treatment enhances the persistence\nof iNK through selective immunodepletion. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that iNK cell specificity, potency,\nand persistence can be enhanced by optimizing IL-15 signaling in the context of CD38 knockout and that a novel\nanti-CD5-ADC will provide effective and safer LD to enhance persistence. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis\nthat dual antigen-specific targeting through a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and CD16 (with Tri-specific Killer\nEngagers [TriKEs]) will further increase efficacy of the iNK cell product against AML. Approaches to maximize\npersistence without exhaustion and antigen targeting will synergize with Projects 1 and 2.",

However, metaproteomic analysis is limited by the low\nabundance of microbes compared to host cells within the tumor microenvironment. Current approaches for\nenrichment (e.g., differential centrifugation) only modestly increase detection of microbes, while culturing\nsamples to boost bacterial abundance suffers from loss of unculturable microbes and their in vivo. An approach\nto efficiently enrich microbes directly from clinical cancer samples, such as tissue biopsies and fluids, and enable\ndeep metaproteomic analysis, would transform our ability to investigate the mechanisms by which non-host\nmicroorganisms influence carcinogenesis and treatment. To address this challenge, we propose to develop and\noptimize a novel approach for enriching microbes from clinical cancer sample (CS) specimens, by developing a\nnovel approach based on bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), coupled with cell sorting\nenrichment and sensitive MS-based metaproteomics. Our interdisciplinary team, which includes clinical and\ntranslational cancer research partners, brings the necessary expertise and access to clinical samples necessary\nfor developing, optimizing, and demonstrating effectiveness of our approach. Our work will pursue these Aims:\nSpecific Aim 1. Optimize and evaluate CS-BONCAT in samples of known composition; Specific Aim 2.\nOptimize and demonstrate proof-of-concept using CS-BONCAT to enable metaproteomic analysis of clinical\ncancer samples. We will focus on optimization in brush biopsy samples from oral cancer patients, and further\ndemonstrate effectiveness in evaluating bacterial metaproteomes associated with colorectal and ovarian cancers\nfrom clinical samples. We will evaluate the effectiveness of our optimized approach through quantitative\nperformance measures, ensuring CS-BONCAT will be useful for the cancer research community. We will\npromote adoption of CS-BONCAT by cancer researchers as part of a complete, clinical metaproteomics workflow\nthrough accessible online and on-demand multimedia resources. Once completed, we will deliver a\ntransformative approach to better understand microorganism contributors to tumorigenesis, impacting diagnosis,\nprevention, and treatment for many cancer types.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY\nImmuno-oncology studies continue to grow which seek new therapies leveraging immunogenic, non-normal\npeptide sequences (neoantigens) arising from tumor-specific alterations at the genomic, transcriptomic or\nproteomic level. Non-normal DNA and RNA sequences that may encode neoantigens can be identified from\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS) data, and further prioritized by their predicted binding to the class I or II major\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) as an indicator of immunogenicity. Immunopeptidomic enrichment of the\npeptide-MHC complex coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) can confirm\nthe existence of predicted neoantigens as well as other tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) derived from normal\nprotein sequences, including those with post-translational modifications (PTMs). This powerful approach\nrequires `immunopeptidogenomic' informatics tools that integrate NGS and MS data analysis. Despite steadily\ngrowing numbers of cancer researchers pursuing these studies, they lack a centralized informatics resource\ntailored to these informatics requirements. As a solution, we will develop the immunopeptidogenomic (iPepGen)\ninformatics resource for immuno-oncology research. iPepGen will leverage the Galaxy bioinformatics\necosystem, offering cancer researchers accessible workflows to predict neoantigens from NGS data and confirm\ntheir presence from MS-based immunopeptidomics data, including training resources housed in the Galaxy\nTraining Network to promote community adoption. We will achieve our goals through these Specific Aims: Aim\n1: Optimize and harden modular workflows for identifying, prioritizing and curating neoantigen candidates\ndetected from genomic and/or transcriptomic alterations; Aim 2: Optimize and harden state-of-the-art MS-based\nimmunopeptidomic analysis modules for identifying and verifying MHC-bound neoantigen and TAA peptides;\nAim 3: Disseminate tested and optimized workflows and engage in training activities to promote community\nadoption of the iPepGen resource. Our team brings complementary, world-class expertise necessary for\nsuccess in developing the iPepGen resource. PIs Griffin and Jagtap have developed widely used Galaxy-based\nmulti-omic tools and training materials for cancer research. PI Nesvizhskii is a world-leader in development of\ncomputational tools for quantitative, MS-based proteomic and peptidomic analysis. Development, testing and\noptimization of tools, workflows and training materials will be guided by collaboration with cancer researchers\nconducting Driving Immuno-oncology Projects (DIPs). The iPepGen resource will offer a critically needed\nresource to advance game-changing immunotherapy studies impacting a wide-variety of cancer types.",

These goals encompass major Specific Aims that have significant \nsynergy: 1) Characterize the harmful effects of tobacco chemicals and products and develop biomarkers for \ncancer risk stratification in clinical and epidemiological studies; 2) Understand the landscape of exposures and \nbiochemical pathways leading to cancer to identify tools for cancer susceptibility assessment, prevention, and \ntreatment; and 3) Identify food products, as well as natural and synthetic chemicals, that reduce cancer risk. \nThe CC Program is led by Lisa Peterson, PhD, and Frank Ondrey, MD, PhD, FACS, who have complementary \nexperience that provides strong and synergistic leadership, and has 22 members from 15 departments across \n8 colleges, schools, and institutes at the University of Minnesota. The CC Program is highly productive, as \nevidenced by the number (523) of intra- (21%) and interprogrammatic (28%) as well as interinstitutional (70%) \npublications and cancer-relevant grant funding ($7.2M). A crosscutting theme of the Program is biomarker \ndevelopment to generate tools to identify at-risk individuals and support targeted prevention or therapeutic \napproaches. Furthermore, the Program\u2019s research tackles all the cancers with elevated risk in Minnesota such \nas melanoma, breast, corpus uteri, blood (leukemia and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma), and bladder cancer as well \nas other cancers highly prevalent in the state. The Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) provides many benefits to \nthe CC Program including Shared Resources (particularly Analytical Biochemistry, Biostatistics, Cancer \nGenomics, and Comparative Pathology); pilot funding; and funds for retreats, seminars, conferences, and \nother meetings. Translation of our basic research findings has been facilitated by active involvement of \nProgram members in 8 Translational Working Groups. All of these activities have helped enhance the \ninteractions among Program members as well as with individuals from other Programs and institutions. The \nfuture directions and goals of the Program fit well within all 4 pillars of MCC\u2019s Strategic Plan. Recently obtained \nfunding engages the Minnesota community and care providers with the goal of accelerating the path to cancer \nprevention and cures, particularly for lung, head and neck, blood and prostate cancers. In addition, we will \nbuild on the success of the 10,000 Family Study by partnering with members of the SPECS Program and \nCommunity Outreach and Engagement to expand our work linking environmental exposures to cancers of \nconcern to Minnesotans.",

SPECS research coalesces around 4 research themes: 1) Reducing the harms of tobacco, 2) \nPreventing cancer through screening and intervention, 3) Improving cancer outcomes, and 4) Childhood \ncancer epidemiology. SPECS members are focused on unique cancer concerns in our catchment area, \nincluding cancer disparities in special populations and elevated rates of melanoma and hematologic cancers. \nThe impact of the Program is evident with research findings leading to changes in policy around commercial \ntobacco products and national guidelines for cancer screening. Three Specific Aims support the research \nthemes of the SPECS Program: 1) Prevent cancer through identification of risk and protection factors and \ndevelop novel approaches to reduce these risks, 2) Improve cancer outcomes with tailored screening and \nnovel interventions in high-risk populations, and 3) Identify factors that impact prognosis and quality of life \namong cancer survivors. The SPECS Program includes 50 members, representing 6 schools and 20 \ndepartments, and has 2 Co-Leaders: Anne Blaes, MD, MS, a Professor and Division Director of Hematology, \nOncology, and Transplantation in the Medical School; and Heather Nelson, MPH, PhD, a Professor in the \nDivision of Epidemiology and Community Health in the School of Public Health. For the last budget year, these \nmembers were supported by $10.5 million in cancer-relevant research funding (direct costs), of which $4.8 \nmillion is from the National Cancer Institute. \nThe Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) has supported the work of the Program in several value-added ways. The \nAnalytical Biochemistry Shared Resource facilitates biomarker work, and the Biostatistics and Cancer \nInformatics Shared Resources support the design of studies and analysis of data. Community Outreach and \nEngagement has provided data on cancer research needs within our catchment area and provided guidance to \nmembers on conducting community-engaged research. In addition, MCC has provided strategic investment \nthrough pilot project funding. The Program, in turn, brings added value to MCC by bringing clinical and \npopulation-based perspectives with a focus of translating research to practice and policy and addressing health \nequity and cancer concerns in our catchment area. Mentoring and training are a priority for the Program, with a \nstrong track record of early-career investigators developing independent research programs. \nFuture directions for the SPECS Program include 2 new initiatives, one around aging and cancer and a second \non environmental exposures and cancer.",

    "abstract_text": "Scientific Abstract Malignant germ cell tumors (GCTs) in children and adults are hypothesized to occur as a\nresult of events in utero. The high heritability of adult testicular GCT (TGCT) suggests a genetic etiology, and\nrecent genomewide association studies support this through the discovery of multiple susceptibility loci. We\nrecently confirmed a subset of these loci as susceptibility variants for pediatric GCT. While 5-year relative survival\nrates are very high overall for GCTs, mainly due to the effectiveness of cisplatin chemotherapy, approximately\n20% of patients will display resistance to chemotherapy or relapse following treatment. Clinical risk stratification\nto identify patients with poor prognosis is still very crude and further molecular analysis, including analysis of\ntumor epigenetics, may help to tailor treatment. Our recently completed Children\u2019s Oncology Group (COG) case-\nparent triad study of GCT was the first large study to collect germline DNA samples from pediatric and adolescent\nGCT cases, tumor specimens and outcomes data. The research proposed in this application will allow us to\nextend the scope of our ongoing study by evaluating tumor DNA methylation as a prognostic factor for GCT and\nby expanding our analyses of germline genetic variation to include the sex chromosomes. Our overarching goal\nfor the proposed study is to evaluate the contribution of genetics and epigenetics in pediatric GCT risk and\noutcomes. Our hypothesis is that DNA methylation patterns will predict GCT cases who are likely to have poor\noutcomes. Further, we hypothesize that common and moderately rare variants on the sex chromosomes\nincrease risk for GCT. To evaluate these hypotheses, we will combine data from our ongoing COG case-parent\ntriad study of pediatric GCT (N=867 cases and 1,517 parent controls) with GCT cases and controls obtained\nfrom the state biobank programs in California, Michigan and Washington (N=1,601 cases and 1,601 controls).\nOur primary aims will be to: 1) Identify methylation patterns that predict poor outcomes, including disease relapse\nand death, and 2) Discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) on the\nsex chromosomes that contribute to GCT risk in children and adolescents. We will also evaluate the contribution\nof rare genetic variants in GCT through the use of aggregate burden tests in an exploratory aim. Methylation will\nbe evaluated using the Illumina EPIC methylation array in 500 GCT tumor samples. Germline genetic analyses\nwill be conducted using existing GWAS data generated on the Illumina Human CoreExome array. The\ncontribution of rare variants will be assessed through analysis of whole exome sequencing data generated\nthrough the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (N=250 trios) and Exome content available\nfor the entire dataset (N=2,468 cases). Little is known about the etiology of pediatric GCT; analysis of germline\ngenetic variation will shed light on disease biology. Identification of methylation patterns associated with poor\nprognosis could improve the existing clinical risk stratification and suggest new avenues for treatment. Finally,\nthis will be the first study of GCT susceptibility in any age group to include individuals of non-European ancestry.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThe 10,000 Families Study (10KFS) will be a new, family-based cohort study in Minnesota, the \u2018Land of 10,000\nLakes\u2019. Due to our high incidence rates of hematologic malignancy (leukemia, lymphoma, and myelodysplastic\nsyndromes), we will focus our proposal on environmental exposures of concern that are possible hematologic\ncarcinogens with limited evidence in humans as defined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer\n(IARC). This includes glyphosate, poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and radon, all of which have\nwell-described geographic variation in prevalence in the state of Minnesota. During the UG3 phase, we will\nevaluate innovative exposure assessment methodologies and recruit diverse participants into the 10KFS\ncohort. Exposure assessment will include residential history, ambient measures in air and water at current\nresidence, as well as individual-level exposure assessed with silicone wearable bracelets, serum, hair, and\nurine. Participants will be recruited from targeted counties that maximize the exposure distribution to our three\ncarcinogens of interest and include under-represented populations from rural and immigrant communities. We\nwill measure clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a precursor to heme malignancy, and\nperturbations in immunity and epigenetics as our primary cancer-related outcomes in the UH3 phase. Our\ntarget is to recruit 8,750 participants from 4,000 households to participate using recruitment strategies that\nhave been developed and pilot tested. Our central hypothesis is that PFAS, glyphosate and radon contribute to\nincreased hematologic malignancy specifically, and cancer incidence broadly, in Minnesota. Cancer incidence\nwill be determined via annual record linkage with the Minnesota Cancer Reporting System (MCRS) and the\nVirtual Pooled Registry Cancer Linkage System. The scientific aims in the UG3 phase will be to: 1) evaluate\ninnovative exposure assessment methods for PFAS and glyphosate that can be easily implemented in a large\nscale study and 2) describe the exposure burden in under-represented immigrant populations. We will\ncomplete recruitment of the study population in the UH3 phase where the specific aims are to: 1) determine\nwhether levels of radon, glyphosate, and PFAS are associated with increased prevalence of CHIP and 2)\nutilize epigenomics to test the hypotheses that radon, glyphosate and PFAS exposure are associated with\nimmune dysregulation and epigenetic signatures. Our community engagement will be conducted in partnership\nwith the non-profit research institute Hispanic Advocacy and Community Empowerment Through Research\n(HACER), the Minnesota Freemasons and Order of the Eastern Star and community educators from the\nExtension Center for Family Development. The results of this study will provide needed data to inform whether\nthese agents are hematologic carcinogens, it will address documented disparities in exposure that occur within\nour state and provide a mechanism for community outreach and education concerning these exposures and\nany potential cancer link.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nI am the Director of the Analytical Biochemistry Shared Resource of the University of Minnesota's Masonic Cancer Center\n(MCC), a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. The shared resource has emerged as a\nleading academic mass spectrometry laboratory, acting as an extension of the MCC's Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention\nProgram (CCP), and providing critical analytical services to CCP members who account for a large majority of the analysis\nperformed in the facility. There are currently 16 NCI-funded projects involving nine CCP members who use the mass\nspectrometry facility. The integration of the Analytical Biochemistry Shared Resource and the CCP is such that the mass\nspectrometry laboratory staff, through extensive training and consultation with group members and collaboration with\nprincipal investigators, functions as the analytical component of many of the research groups. The scientific goals of the\nCCP are to understand the chemical and molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The relevance of this knowledge to\npublic health is through the ability to use it to develop and evaluate practical methods for cancer prevention.\nI am an integral part of the CCP through extensive consultation and collaboration with the members regarding their mass\nspectrometry-based analyses, as well as by working very closely with their research groups. I have daily interactions with\nthe investigators and routinely attend laboratory group meetings, contribute to writing manuscripts, and participate in the\nCCP Seminar Series and the Translational Biomarkers Working Group. The need for my consultation and collaboration\nwith members of the CCP regarding advanced analytical measurement, as well as day-to-day training and oversight of\nmembers of their research groups, has been growing steadily with the increasing analytical capabilities of the laboratory\nand increasing dependency of the users on mass spectrometric analysis to advance their research. There is an ongoing need\nto continue to advance the analytical capabilities of the facility as the field of biomedical mass spectrometry continues to\ngrow and the research goals of the program members evolve. An external source of financial support would give me the\nindependence and freedom to focus on collaborative efforts with the NCI-funded members of the CCP to provide them with\nthe guidance and knowledge to harness the advanced analytical capabilities of the mass spectrometry laboratory.",

The DAC MPIs are Jinhua Wang, an expert in genome informatics and bioinformatics modeling with a\nlong track record in successfully building and leading informatics cores for center grants at the University of\nMinnesota (UMN), and Alexander Misharin, a senior researcher specializing in single cell data and integrative\ngenomics at Northwestern University. The DAC also includes experts in cross-species comparative genomics,\ntranscriptomic analysis, gene pathway modeling, genetic biomarker selection, proteomics/metabolomics data\nanalysis and tool development, deep neural network modeling of cellular imaging, and statistical planning, quality\ncontrol measures, and statistical hypothesis testing. The overall goal of the DAC is to perform multi-scale and\nmulti-modality analysis of the collected data (for SnC identification, novel SnC biomarker discovery, SnC spatial\npattern discovery, and SnC cellular states dynamics modeling) and prepare it for the SenNet Consortium\nOrganization and Data Coordinating Center (CODCC) for the construction of a murine SnC 4D Atlas. The DAC\nMPIs will work closely with Yale and UMN human TMC DAC centers to inform and help advance the ongoing\nanalysis carried out in human tissues. Notably, DAC MPI Wang has had productive collaborations with Yale and\nUMN human DAC directors for more than a decade. Select murine tissues (liver, lung, skeletal muscle, and\nadipose) over a range of ages, strains, and perturbations will be analyzed with both bulk and single cell profiling\nand spatial analysis by the MM-TMC Biological Analysis Core (BAC). The DAC will be responsible for data\ningestion from the BAC, mapping to interoperable and searchable ontologies, annotation, curation, and analysis.\nWe will 1) build or use the best practice tools for data storage, search, retrieval, analysis, and multi-omics data\njoint embedding; 2) create a comprehensive murine SnC biomarker set, including both known and novel\nbiomarkers; and 3) establish a cross-comparison procedure to bridge murine and human SnC analyses. In\ncollaboration with the SenNet Consortium, the DAC will establish benchmarks, contribute to standard operating\nprocedures and standards development, and prepare and share datasets with the CODCC to enable a murine\nSnC 4D atlas. The DAC will leverage cutting-edge informatics, high performance computing, expert faculty, and\nadvanced data analytics, data storage and management capabilities at MM-TMC institutions. The DAC will also\nwork closely with the other TMCs and the CODCC to develop and implement customized SenNet-wide standards\nfine-tuned to the needs of the consortium including: 1) data quality metrics, ontologies, and data elements; 2)\nintegration of imaging and omics data analytical tools for visualization, segmentation, and annotation; 3) SOPs;\n4) Common Data Elements; and 5) a network public data sharing policy.",

Genetically modified mice have been vital tools for cancer \nstudies for many years, enabling researchers to determine the roles of specific genes in cancer-relevant traits \nsuch as immune evasion, tumor initiation, and metastasis. MGL meets this need through the following specific \naims: 1) Produce transgenic and knockout mice, 2) Cryopreserve mouse sperm and embryos, 3) Assist with \nmouse embryo manipulation, and 4) Provide scientific consultation and specialized services. \nThese services provide MCC members convenient, cost-effective access to genetically modified mice. Access \nto these mice and associated technologies is critical to the ongoing work of MCC, particularly to members of \nthe Genetic Mechanisms, Immunology, and Cellular Mechanisms Programs. \nMGL is led by Dr. Timothy Hallstrom, who has 15 years of experience with mouse genetics research. He is the \nPI of a research laboratory focused on the cellular mechanisms controlling the retinoblastoma protein. Day-to- \nday operations of MGL are managed by Yun You, PhD, who also educates users of the laboratory on policies, \nprotocols, and maintenance of transgenic mouse strains. \nDuring the current period of support, MGL was able to rapidly respond to investigators\u2019 needs during the \nCOVID-19 outbreak by processing many different lines for sperm cryopreservation. We introduced a new \nservice that allows 2-cell embryos to be frozen for later rederivation. This circumvents the usual need for \nsometimes complex breeding encountered after standard frozen embryo derivation. We have also worked with \nthe Genome Engineering Shared Resource to significantly improve the efficacy of CRISPR with large DNA \nconstructs by using adeno-associated virus for CRISPR delivery of large insertions (~4.5 kb). \nServices offered internally by MGL are often more cost-effective and efficient than using external providers. \nMGL is supported by the University as well as CCSG funds, and MCC members are given priority over other \nusers.

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nImmunological tolerance prevents autoimmune disease by deleting self-reactive T cell clones or impairing\ntheir function. While there is much know about how CD4+ self-reactive T cells become anergic or acquire\nsuppressive functions, there is less known about non-deletional forms of CD8+ tolerance. The proposed\nresearch builds on our previous findings regarding CD8+ T cell tolerance to the melanocyte antigen Trp2,\nwhere non-deletional tolerance is prominent. The paucity of CD8+ T cells that react to a given antigen like\nTrp2 has presented a challenge to acquiring deeper mechanistic understanding. Here we employ two new\nTCR\uf8fd single chain transgenic models where either deletion or non-deletional tolerance prevails, and the\nfrequency of Trp2 reactive clones is sufficiently high to allow mechanistic studies. Our approach will employ\nsingle cell genomics analysis (scRNAseq and scATACseq) to define the gene-regulation that inhibits non-\ndeleted self-reactive CD8+ T cells. Further experiments will use deep sequencing of the TCR\u03b1 repertoire and\ngenerate TCR\u03b1\uf8fd retrogenic models to define how the repertoire is shaped by self-antigens and provide\nfunctional classification of different self- reactive clones into 4 types: imperfectly deleted high-avidity clones,\nlow-avidity anergized clones, low avidity non-anergized clones and \u201cdangerous\u201d clones that evade tolerance\nmechanisms altogether. Finally, we will use an established model of vaccination-induced vitiligo to\ndetermine which types of tolerance put animals most at risk of autoimmune disease when provoked by\ninflammation. This work will test the central hypothesis that while self-reactive CD8+ T cell clones with the\nhighest avidity for self are purged from the repertoire, other self- reactive cells survive and are epigenetically\nrepressed to maintain tolerance.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\n The induction and maintenance of adaptive immune responses are critical for effective and durable\nprotection against diverse pathogens and the efficacy of vaccines. Yet it is known that both the homeostasis\nand function of adaptive immune cells declines with age \u2013 while there may be multiple causes for this, recent\nstudies (including those from our group) indicate a potentially pivotal role for senescent cells. Diverse cell\ntypes (including immune cells) become senescent with age and in various chronic disease states, and this\nstate not only affects the replicative potential of the senescent cells (SnC) themselves, but by their production\nof a variety of factors (in what is termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype or SASP), they can\naffect other cells, in trans. Many of these SASP factors are pro-inflammatory and can provoke\nimmunopathology in vulnerable populations (including the aged, as illustrated in the cytokine storm reported in\nelderly COVID-19 patients). These \u201cbystander\u201d effects have been demonstrated in experimental mouse\nmodels. Most exciting, ablation of SnC (using senotherapeutic compounds) results in marked improvement of\nimmune control of pathogens. However, there is a key knowledge gap in understanding what effect SnCs\nhave on adaptive immune populations, how those effects are mediated and how crosstalk between senescent\nand immune cells influences the physiological establishment of senescence with age. We address these in\nthree Specific Aims. Aim 1 tests how exposure to SnC \u2013 as a single variable \u2013 influences adaptive immune cell\nhomeostasis and function in response to defined viral infections, using well defined mouse models to pinpoint\nthe consequences of SnC introduction vs destruction on na\u00efve and memory T and B cell populations. This\nincludes functional and single-cell analysis approaches. In Aim 2, we turn the tables by investigating tantalizing\ndata which indicate certain immune populations (including NK cells) may be capable of SnC destruction during\nnormal physiology \u2013 a feedback loop that we suspect is compromised with age, resulting in SnC build up. The\nfunction of NK cells and other immune populations in culling SnC will be explored. Aim 3 explores how SnC\nmediate their inhibitory effects on lymphocytes \u2013 by harnessing the power of CRISPR/Cas9 approaches to\nablate receptors for SASP factors and explore the functional significance of immunoregulatory molecules\ninduced on \u201cyoung\u201d T cells in the aged environment, as well as test the ability of SASP factors to provoke these\nage-related changes, in vitro in both mouse and human cells. The approaches and goals integrate with the\nsingle-cell studies, novel mouse model development and refinement of senotherapeutics conducted in Project\n1, and with complementary studies on generation, homeostasis and function of adaptive immune cells\nembedded in non-lymphoid tissues, conducted in Project 3. A consistent source of the key mouse models and\npathogens used will be provided by Core B, while all the single-cell analysis from Project 2 and the other\nProjects will be conducted and integrated by Core C. The Administrative Core (Core A) will oversee\ncoordinated work of Projects and Cores and establish internal and external review.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY\nThe association between advanced age and impaired resistance to infections is well known, but poorly\nunderstood. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a clear example of the vulnerability of the elderly to SARS-\nCoV-2 infection as well as many other pathogens. Considerable research efforts have shown that components\nof both the innate and adaptive immune systems show signs of dysfunction as we age, with signs of both\nimmunodeficiency, including reduced innate response and poor induction of adaptive immune memory, and\nimmunopathology including an exaggerated \u201ccytokine storm\u201d. However, while aspects of age-related changes\nin immune cells have been explored in depth, the focus has been on defining the nature of dysfunction within\ncells of the immune system itself, rather than investigating the potential role of other cell populations in\ndominantly compromising immune homeostasis and immunological response to pathogens. Also, although the\nincrease in immunosenescence with age, defined by cell surface markers for immune cell exhaustion, has\nbeen examined, the extent of cellular senescence in immune cell populations with age and pathogen exposure\nremains undefined. Our recent findings indicate that senescent cells (SnCs), including senescent immune\ncells, can exert a \u201cbystander\u201d effect on immune cells, provoking immunological dysfunction through secretion of\ninflammatory factors, including cytokines and chemokines, termed the \u201csenescence-associated secretory\nphenotype\u201d (SASP). We demonstrated that SASP factor production is increased when SnCs or mice containing\nSnCs are exposed to pathogens or microbial products that induce innate immune activation. Exposure of old\nmice to normal microbial experience (NME) housing resulted in 100% mortality compared to no mortality in\nyoung mice. However, reducing the senescent cell burden in aged mice before or following pathogen exposure\nreduced the spread of senescence, the cytokine storm and overall mortality. These results suggests that SnCs,\nacting at least in part through SASP factors, can increase peripheral senescence and immune dysfunction\nfollowing pathogen exposure. Moreover, viral infection itself drives senescence, termed virus induced\nsenescence, in mice and humans. Using mouse models in which cellular senescence is induced specifically in\nimmune cells, we also demonstrated that senescent immune cells drive immunological dysfunction and\nsecondary senescence and pathology in non-lymphoid tissues. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that\nsenescent cells, including senescent immune cell types, dominantly compromise innate and adaptive immune\ncell homeostasis in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs and reactivity to pathogens. Importantly, we also\nhypothesize that these adverse effects can be reversed by SnC elimination with senolytics, providing a new\ntherapeutic strategy to restoring immune function in the aged. We propose to test these hypotheses in our\nPPG application entitled \u201cThe role of senescent cells in dysregulating immune responses and pathogen\ncontrol\u201d, consisting of three collaborative projects and three integrated cores.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThis project proposes to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms within the nucleus accumbens (NAc)\ndriving cue-elicited reward seeking during aversion-resistant alcohol drinking (ARD), defined as drinking\ndespite negative consequences or \u201ccompulsive alcohol drinking\u201d, using optogenetics and simultaneous in-vivo\nelectrophysiology and optogenetics in male and female Long-Evans rats. Environmental reward predicting\ncues provide a source of motivation for reward-seeking which may be heightened following extended alcohol\nuse, resulting in maladaptive, ARD, a defining feature of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Despite the well-\nestablished role of the NAc in mediating cue-elicited reward seeking, motivation, and ARD, the neural signature\nwithin the NAc during cue and alcohol access in ARD is not known, which greatly limits prevention and\ntreatment of AUD. The NAc is innervated by glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular nucleus of the\nthalamus (PVT). This projection is thought to be relevant for processing motivational conflict and preventing\nunproductive reward seeking, while sparing normal affective behavior. However, the PVT-to-NAc pathway\u2019s\nrole in modulating NAc encoding during ARD or how the activity of PVT-to-NAc neurons alter ARD is not\nknown. Thus, the central hypotheses of this project are 1) the NAc encodes cue and outcome information\nrelated to ARD. Specifically, neural activity in the NAc responds to reward (alcohol access) predictive cues and\nto alcohol rewards in a discriminative stimulus task and that over continued alcohol use, this activity increases\nin correlation with the development of ARD and 2) the neuronal activity in the NAc is causally related to an\nexcitatory projection from the PVT that acts to prevent ARD initially, but erodes over time resulting in ARD. This\nproject will assess the neural mechanisms of cue-elicited reward seeking and ARD during a discriminative\nstimulus task using both optogenetic circuit manipulations and simultaneous optogenetics and awake-and-\nbehaving electrophysiology recordings. The training plan for this project is curated in an ideal research\nenvironment in the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Minnesota which will provide training in\ncutting edge neuroscience techniques, professional development, and research ethics that will amass an ideal\ntraining experience to facilitate my career as an independent alcohol research scientist. The specific research\nhypotheses are 1) Optogenetic inhibition of PVT-to-NAc neurons at cue presentation and alcohol reward will\ncause ARD in otherwise aversion-sensitive rats. 2) Optogenetic excitation of PVT-to-NAc at cue presentation\nand alcohol reward will reduce ARD, causing aversion-sensitivity, in otherwise ARD rats. 3) Ensembles of\nneurons within the NAc encode cue and alcohol rewards during ARD. This encoding is facilitated by the PVT-\nto-NAc projection whereby PVT-to-NAc inhibition will increase NAc encoding of cues and alcohol rewards and\nPVT-to-NAc excitation will reduce this encoding within the NAc. Completion of the proposed work will elucidate\nunderstanding of the neural mechanisms of ARD and will aid in the prevention and treatment of AUD.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nType I interferons (IFN) are crucial to anti-viral immunity. Neutralizing autoantibodies (AAb) to IFN are found in\nthe general population, increase in prevalence with age, and are linked to worse, often fatal, outcomes in some\nof the most lethal acute respiratory viral diseases known to date, including fulminant influenza and COVID-19\npneumonia. Despite this, the mechanisms behind the formation of IFN AAb remain unknown.\nHuman data suggest that impairments in thymic tolerance\u2014due to dysfunction of autoimmune regulator (AIRE)\nand medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC)\u2014may be required for the development of IFN AAb. AIRE is a\ntranscription factor expressed by mTEC that is essential for establishing T cell tolerance in the thymus. In\nmTEC, AIRE promotes the expression and presentation of antigens from extrathymic tissues to developing T\ncells (thymocytes). This allows for the elimination of auto-reactive thymocyte clones, thereby preventing\nautoimmunity. Interestingly, AIRE+ mTEC have been shown to express IFN at steady-state conditions in the\nthymus suggesting that, in this context, AIRE+ mTEC act as antigen-presenting cells to thymocytes to mediate\nT cell tolerance to IFN. Supporting this idea, individuals with Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome 1 (APS1),\nwho lack AIRE and experience T cell tolerance loss, consistently develop IFN AAb. These AAb are isotype-\nswitched and somatically hypermutated, supporting the notion that a failure of T cell tolerance, rather than\nsolely B cell tolerance, is necessary for their generation. However, additional findings suggest that loss of\nthymic T cell tolerance alone is insufficient for IFN AAb to develop. First, APS1 patients do not typically present\nIFN AAb at birth or infancy; instead, they develop these AAb later in life after exposure to pathogens is likely to\nhave occurred. Second, IFN AAb have not been observed in specific pathogen-free, Aire-deficient mice.\nCombined, these observations suggest that pathogen exposure, in addition to AIRE and mTEC dysfunction,\nmay be required for IFN AAb to develop.\nThis proposal aims to understand how infections, combined with AIRE deficiency, contribute to the loss of\nthymic tolerance to IFN. My central hypothesis is that in individuals with predisposing AIRE deficiency,\ninfections that induce IFN expression act as a double hit, promoting the development of neutralizing IFN AAb.\nUntil now, methods to detect neutralizing IFN AAb in mice have been lacking, which has hindered the field's\nability to test this hypothesis. I have developed a novel, sensitive, reproducible, and high-throughput assay for\ndetecting murine neutralizing IFN AAb. This new tool will serve as the basis for this proposal and will facilitate\nexploration of how microbial infections and thymic defects contribute to the development of IFN AAb in an\nanimal model. The findings from this work will deepen our understanding of how tolerance to IFN is mediated\nand may inform strategies to prevent IFN AAb development in affected individuals.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is an epidemic, evident from its substantial global prevalence and burden,\nand is driving other major public health issues, including economic consequences. More than 30% of\nindividuals living with MDD demonstrate no response to two or more antidepressant interventions and\nultimately exhibit treatment resistance. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a safe,\nevidence-based, and non-invasive neuromodulation therapy for treatment-resistant depression. TMS utilizes\nelectromagnetic induction to create an electric current in the brain, depolarizing cortical neurons and eliciting\nneurophysiological and behavioral effects. TMS works by inducing neuroplasticity, both within the stimulated\ncortex and its broader connected networks. However, the current efficacy rate of TMS for MDD remains up to\n60%. This variability in treatment response may partially result from current clinical TMS approaches failing to\nincorporate the influence of brain dynamics at the time of stimulation on the neuroplastic effects and\ntherapeutic outcomes. In line with this notion, it may be possible to reliably improve TMS response by\nenhancing the TMS-induced neuroplasticity through synchronizing the stimulation with ongoing neural activity.\nAn oscillation-locked stimulation protocol delivers stimulation timed to a certain phase of an endogenous\nneural oscillation, which has been shown to modulate the ongoing brain activity in a more selective manner.\nSpecifically, oscillation-locked stimulation can reliably produce opposing neuroplastic outcomes of potentiation\nor depression, depending on whether a pulse occurs at a negative-going or positive-going phase of a local\noscillatory potential. Initial investigations and my Preliminary Data indicate that this effect is present in the\nhuman left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a critical hub in circuits governing cognitive and affective functions\nand the most common clinical TMS target. However, these findings have not been extensively examined, and\nthe impact of oscillation-locked TMS on neuroplasticity has not been fully delineated. I will aim to bridge this\nknowledge gap by elucidating how precise, oscillation-locked TMS induces local and network neuroplasticity\nand by examining how these effects vary across the spectrum of depressive severity. My central hypothesis is\nthat the phase of the ongoing oscillatory activity at the time of stimulation will differentially modulate both local\n(Aim 1) and network (Aim 2) neuroplasticity in adults without psychiatric diagnoses and those with MDD. This\nstudy will advance our theoretical understanding of clinically relevant neuroplasticity and investigate the\npotential of developing a brain state-dependent TMS protocol to effectively modulate relevant brain networks.\nIn addition to completing the proposed research study under the Kirschstein-NRSA Fellowship, I will pursue\nrigorous clinical and career development activities to fulfill the requirements for my MD and PhD degrees and\nestablish myself as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in neuromodulation.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary: The gradual loss of physical and cognitive ability has been taken as the near-universal\nconsequence of growing older. Older adults slow down physically, with reduced gait speed and increased\ninstability, and slow cognitively, with declining memory and executive function. Disease pathologies can\naccelerate these declines and are the focus of most aging research. Nonetheless, exceptions to these\ntrajectories can be identified, most notably cognitive \u201cSuperAgers,\u201d who retain the working memory of people\n30 years younger. Initial research on SuperAgers has focused only on cognition studied through static, MR-\nbased neuroimaging and cytoarchitectural examination of post-mortem brains. However, as mounting evidence\ndemonstrates fast movement is a distinguishing feature of health and longevity in older adults, our research\nemphasizes the dynamic interaction between brain neural and vascular function during physical movement.\nOur preliminary data illustrate that older adults age 75+ years with exceptionally fast walking speeds and who\nare free of cognitive decline \u2013 who we have termed fast-moving SuperAgers - display a robust capacity for\nneuroplasticity induction (measured with electroencephalography (EEG)) and remarkably high cerebral blood\nflow (measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD)) during whole-body behavioral learning. Motivated\nby these captivating data, this DP2 project will test the novel hypothesis that fast-moving SuperAgers are\nenriched in unique neuroplasticity and cerebrovascular profiles that are neuroprotective and enable remarkably\nhigh physical and cognitive function as they near or enter their 9th and 10th decade.\nThis project embraces a systems-neuroscience perspective to study neuroplasticity induction and interactions\nwith real-time cerebrovascular function in the unique aging phenotype of fast-moving SuperAgers. We utilize a\nhighly innovative, multimodal approach (EEG, biomechanics, TCD) to quantify the adaptation of cortical and\nbiomechanical responses to repeated standing balance perturbations. We synergistically assess real-time\ncerebral blood flow velocity during this balance learning task and interactions with cortical plasticity induction.\nWe will compare the state and longitudinal trajectory of neuroplasticity and cerebrovascular function in fast-\nmoving SuperAgers to their normally- and slow-moving peers under the same learning conditions. These\nresults could identify key functional neuroprotective mechanisms of brain aging to be leveraged and targeted\nwith future interventions to prevent decline of cognition and physical function. The development of targeted,\nphysiologically-informed interventions through a lens of brain resilience for neurodegenerative diseases such\nas dementia would be especially impactful because current pathology-focused treatments (e.g. anti-amyloid\ndrugs) are extremely limited. Findings gleaned through our innovative conceptual and technical approach to\nstudy human aging neurobiology could pave the way towards a new resilience-focused framework, enabling us\nto make impactful scientific discoveries to improve the lives of aging Americans.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nDuring the aging process there is a loss of automaticity in balance and mobility, where the engagement of\ncortical resources for balance control may interfere with older adults\u2019 ability to perform cognitive and balance\nbehaviors simultaneously. Over the course of normal aging, there is a decline in cerebral blood flow that is\nlinked to impaired cognitive function in older adults. However, it remains unknown whether age-related\ndeclines in cerebrovascular and nervous system function may interact to manifest as cognitive interference in\nbalance control that precipitate falls and clinical dementia. Further, older adults who carry the Apolipoprotein\nE4 (APOE4) allele, the greatest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, show greater\ncerebrovascular dysfunction compared to age-matched noncarriers, and display worse balance performance\nunder cognitive loading conditions, supporting the potential effect of individual genotype on the link between\ncerebrovascular health and balance control with aging.\nUsing electroencephalography (EEG) to measure dynamic cortical activity during standing balance reactions,\nthe candidate\u2019s recent fellowship findings provide an individualized framework of cortical engagement\nstrategies for balance control in older adults that is associated with distinct aspects of balance behavior and fall\nrisk, including cognitive interference in balance performance. Currently, a major scientific barrier to the clinical\ntranslation of this research is the lack of understanding of the factors that influence individual-specific cortical\nstrategies for balance control with aging. Emerging evidence suggests cognitive impairment with aging may be\ncaused by dysfunctional cerebral blood flow, specifically characterized by impaired cerebrovascular regulation\nunder conditions of physiologic stress. Blunted cerebral blood flow response to an acute bout aerobic exercise,\nan assessment method pioneered by Dr. Billinger (primary mentor) and her laboratory, appears to be an early\nindicator of dysfunctional cerebrovascular regulation in preclinical older adult populations. The proposed\nproject will be the first to test the link between cerebrovascular regulation during an acute bout of aerobic\nexercise, measured as cerebral blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and cortical\nfunction during balance behavior with aging, measured with cognitive dual-task balance performance (Aim\n1) and EEG measures of cortical activity during balance reactions (Aim 2). An Exploratory Aim will test whether\ngenetic APOE4 carrier status alters the relationship between cerebrovascular regulation and balance control in\nolder adults. The scientific knowledge gained from these studies would create an individualized framework for\nunderstanding cardiovascular-nervous system interactions that may contribute to balance disability in older\nadults. This framework would provide a foundation for the development of precision-medicine strategies for fall\nprevention, particularly in individuals at high risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and subsequent falls.",

Emergency departments (EDs) and emergency medical services (EMS) serve as critical\nintervention points for patients experiencing opioid-related crises. However, despite strong evidence\nsupporting ED-initiated medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), implementation remains limited\ndue to provider hesitancy, institutional barriers, and gaps in post-discharge care. This project seeks to\naddress these challenges by integrating structured, high-dose buprenorphine induction across EMS\nand ED settings while ensuring sustained post-discharge engagement through a multidisciplinary\nmobile outreach team.\nObjectives: This study will evaluate the impact of a structured MOUD expansion model that spans\nprehospital, acute care, and community settings. The primary objectives are to:\n1. Increase buprenorphine administration in ED and EMS settings to improve rapid access to MOUD.\n2. Enhance provider adoption of high-dose buprenorphine induction protocols through structured\ntraining and technical assistance.\n3. Improve patient retention at 7-day and 30-day post-discharge intervals via proactive mobile\noutreach and linkage to outpatient treatment.\n4. Decrease overall ED utilization among patients receiving buprenorphine, reducing avoidable\nhealthcare encounters and hospital burden.\nMethods: This study employs a mixed-methods evaluation framework, integrating both quantitative\nand qualitative assessments. Electronic health records (EHRs) will track buprenorphine\nadministration rates, help monitor retention in treatment, and measure changes to ED utilization and\nhospital re-admissions. Provider surveys and structured interviews will assess confidence and\nknowledge in high-dose induction protocols. The ED-IMAT tool will systematically evaluate\ninstitutional readiness, training gaps, and care linkage challenges. Qualitative insights from Extension\nfor Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) sessions will further inform implementation barriers\nand real-time adaptation strategies.\nSignificance: By embedding a sustainable, data-driven MOUD expansion model within acute and\nprehospital care settings, this initiative directly supports Healthy People 2030 objectives to increase\nthe proportion of individuals receiving MOUD and reduce opioid-related mortality. Findings will\ncontribute to national efforts to scale ED and EMS-based addiction treatment, inform state and\nmunicipal policy, and establish a replicable framework for integrating MOUD into emergency care\nworkflows.\nImpact: This project aims to transform opioid overdose response by shifting from a reactive to a\nproactive, patient-centered model of care. Through structured capacity-building, real-time technical\nassistance, and post-discharge navigation, this initiative will optimize MOUD retention, improve health\noutcomes, and reduce opioid-related harms at the population level.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe lymphatic system plays an important role in maintaining tissue-fluid homeostasis, the absorption of dietary\nfats, and the transport of immune cells throughout the body to combat infection. Central conducting lymphatic\nanomaly (CCLA) is a disorder resulting from lymphatic network conduction abnormalities which can result in\nthe accumulation of fluid in tissues. Despite recent advances in patient sample collection and more thorough\ngenetic testing, only about 40% of patients with CCLA have a defined genetic cause. Identification of the\nunderlying disease mechanism in these patients has resulted in the targeted trial of specific pathway inhibitors\nincluding MEK, ERK, and PI3K. Elucidating novel genetic causes of CCLA will inform the development of new\ncustom therapies. Exome sequencing in a cohort of five families with children who presented with non-immune\nfetal hydrops revealed FZD6 variants. FZD6 has therefore emerged as a potential novel cause of CCLA. FZD6\nis a WNT receptor and a core member of the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. In humans, loss of\nFZD6 function causes nail dysplasia, which is also present in the identified cohort. The core PCP genes Celsr1\nand Vangl2 are shown to be involved in lymphatic valve formation in mice and defects in PCP signaling due to\npathogenic variants in CELSR1 have been implicated in lymphatic malformations in humans. However, the role\nof FZD6 in lymphatic network development and function is unstudied. We hypothesize that FZD6 is important\nfor lymphatic system development, and the identified variants result in CCLA by disrupting PCP signaling.\nFurther, in addition to the role PCP plays during valve formation, we propose PCP has an earlier role in\nshaping the lymphatic network by regulating lymphatic endothelial cell dynamics. I will test these hypotheses\nusing PCP loss of function mouse models. I will assess the morphology of the developing lymphatic vessels\nand valves in PCP mutant embryos compared to littermate controls in the dermis and mesentery (Aim 1). I will\nthen assess the molecular function of FZD6 variants identified in patients. Subsequently, I will determine how\nthe loss of PCP function affects lymphatic network uptake and conductance capabilities by injecting a tracer\nmolecule (Aim 2). Finally, I will determine which lymphatic endothelial cellular behaviors are influenced by PCP\nsignaling through a live-imaging approach (Aim 3). Completing these aims will identify a novel genetic driver of\nCCLA and inform targeted treatments to rescue the effects of FZD6 loss. Further, the results of this study will\nfill the gaps in our understanding of the role of PCP signaling in lymphatic network formation during\ndevelopment.",

    "abstract_text": "Functional decline of visceral adipose tissue, both immunologically and metabolically, contributes to age-related diseases. Aging induces phenotypic alterations in immune cells and adipocytes within adipose tissue, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic dysfunction including impaired lipolysis and glucose resistance. Notably, aged adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) exhibit increased mitochondrial\nburden, altered chromatin accessibility, and amplified secretion of inflammatory cytokines, collectively driving visceral adipose dysfunction through interactions with other immune cells and white adipocytes.\nIn the pre-F99 phase, I demonstrated that GDF3, a cytokine secreted selectively by ATMs, activates the canonical SMAD2/3 pathway and shifts the chromatin landscape of ATMs toward an inflammatory profile with age. GDF3 also worsens glucose sensitivity in old mice, suggesting a GDF3-mediated interaction between ATMs and adipocyte dysfunction during aging. In the F99 phase, I will investigate how the GDF3-\nSMAD2/3 axis impairs lipolysis in aged adipocytes. Adipocytes are heterogeneous and can be classified into subsets based on functionality. Age-related imbalance in these subsets, such as a decline in lipolytic adipocyte subset, may impair lipolysis, leading to reduced exercise capacity, dampened cold stress resilience, and exacerbated inflammation during infections in the elderly. However, adipocyte complexity\nremains largely understudied, particularly in the context of aging, due to the lack of accessible tools for single cell resolution analysis. I will continue developing methods to explore adipocytes at the single cell level, aiming to identify, characterize and target the lipolytic adipocyte subset affected by GDF3-SMAD2/3 signaling. The pathophysiologic role of mitochondria during aging, specifically the link between mitochondrial\ndysfunction and chronic inflammation, has been increasingly recognized. In the K00 phase, I will explore how mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction originating from bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) impacts ATMs.\nWith an increasing frequency of ATMs originating from HSCs during aging, HSC-derived mt dysfunction may drive the heightened inflammatory phenotype observed in their progeny ATMs. I propose targeting mt dysfunction and inflammatory ATMs by inhibiting the cGAS-STING pathway, which is activated by mt stress.\nSince HSCs give rise to macrophages in multiple tissues, this research may have broad applicability beyond adipose tissue and result in novel therapeutic approaches to reduce inflammation and metabolic decline in the elderly.\nThis proposal will yield new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating age-related alterations in macrophages and adipocytes. Furthermore, I aim to target these identified mechanisms using genetic and pharmaceutical tools to mitigate adipose functional decline, ultimately alleviating age-related diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAdvances in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment have dramatically improved long-term survival of those\ndiagnosed with breast cancer. However, this success has been tempered by a parallel increased incidence of\nadverse outcomes and chronic conditions in breast cancer survivors, including cardiotoxicity due at least in part\nto cardiotoxic treatment regimens. Current evidence-based guidelines for preventing and controlling\ncardiotoxicity in breast cancer survivors are broad, and we lack clear guidance for assessing individualized risks\nof cardiovascular events. Existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction models focus on the general\npopulation and rely only on a limited number of variables. Thus, there is a critical need to develop novel AI-\npowered informatics frameworks to build, maintain, and enhance models predicting cardiovascular risk among\nbreast cancer survivors across diverse health systems. Responding to the RFA-FD-25-015, the objective of this\napplication is to develop and validate a scalable, generalizable, and explainable AI-powered informatics\nframework, CardioOnco-AI, which innovates on the curation and modeling of real world data (RWD) for\nindividualized prediction of cardiotoxicity among breast cancer survivors. Towards this objective, we propose the\nfollowing specific aims: 1) Data curation - extract and derive cancer phenotype and non-medical determinant of\nhealth (nMDoH) variables to create research datasets for cardiotoxicity risk prediction through novel AI-\nempowered informatics solutions; 2) EHR-based predictive modeling - develop and evaluate novel cardiotoxicity\nprediction models for breast cancer survivors across two sites; and 3) Evaluation - assess the generalizability of\nCardioOnco-AI in two large geographically diverse RWD consortia. This project will deliver a novel, generalizable\nframework that integrates structured and unstructured RWD to improve cardiotoxicity risk prediction in breast\ncancer survivors. This work directly aligns with FDA\u2019s regulatory science priorities and supports safer post-\ntreatment survivorship care. The tools and methods developed will be adaptable to other sites, data\nenvironments, and oncology drug safety surveillance efforts.",

Most\ncurrent studies focus on drug interventions for AD/ADRD and currently none of pharmacological intervention (PI)\ndiscovery research has been translated into effective treatments. However, increasing evidence demonstrates\nthat non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), such as sleep, diet, dietary supplements, aerobic exercise,\naromatherapy, light therapy, cognitive training, are potentially modifiable and thus offer alternative opportunities\nfor AD/ADRD prevention. Thus, the objective of this project is to develop translational informatics approaches to\naggregate, standardize and discover the effects of drug and NPI candidates on AD/ADRD using multi-modal\ndata resources (i.e., biomedical literature, EHR, clinical trials) followed by animal model validation. To achieve\nour goal, we propose the following aims: 1) constructing a comprehensive Pharmacological And Non-\nPharmacological Interventions for Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Graph (PANIA-KG) from biomedical literature\nand other knowledge bases; 2) detecting, understanding, and visualization of drug repurposing signals of PIs,\nNPIs, and their synergistical effects for AD/ADRD using the PANIA-KG; 3) re-ranking and validating individual\nand synergistical drug repurposing signals using multimodal data sources and animal models. The successful\ncompletion of this project will deliver a comprehensive NPI knowledge graph, novel informatics approaches,\nranked list of drug and NPI candidates, and validated synergistic intervention using multi-modal data sources.\nThe generated approaches, PANIA-KG and ranked lists can further our clinical investigations and clinical trial\ndesign which focuses on synergistic effects of drug and NPIs for AD/ADRD.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\n A founder mutation in the ARTEMIS gene resulting in Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID-A) is\ncommon in the Athabascan-speaking Navajo and Apache populations (a minority group) in the United States.\nOne in 2,000 live births in this community have this devastating genetic disorder, resulting in a complete lack of\nmature T and B lymphocytes. The current standard of care for these patients is a bone marrow transplant, which\noften does not result in B cell reconstitution, carries risk of graft versus host disease, and necessitates harsh\npreconditioning regimens. Clinical trials are ongoing for ex vivo gene therapy using a lentiviral vector to insert\nadditional copies of ARTEMIS in patient hematopoietic stem cells. We are pursuing a more targeted treatment\nusing Adenine Base Editor (ABE) to convert two bases of ARTEMIS without causing double-stranded breaks in\nthe genome. ABE can edit this mutation with a conservative amino acid substitution, replacing the premature\nstop codon. The effect of this edit on hematopoietic stem cells' immune reconstitution ability has not yet been\nexamined. This proposed work aims to validate ABE conservative substitution as a viable therapy for SCID-A\nand establish in vivo delivery methods to hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) for immune reconstitution\nusing a novel, genetically humanized SCID-A mouse model that we recently developed.\n Aim 1 will characterize the efficacy and safety of the conservative substitution strategy with multiple in vitro\nArtemis assays in both a K562 SCID-A cell line and SCID-A murine hematopoietic stem cells. Aim 2 explores in\nvivo delivery of therapeutic guide RNA and base editor mRNA to HSPCs in our SCID-A mouse model. Novel\ncationic polymer micelles from the Reineke group will be tested in vivo along with recombinant adeno-associated\nvirus (rAAV) serotype 6 to establish the feasibility of immune reconstitution by edited HSPCs in vivo. This work\nwill lay the groundwork for potential in vivo base editor therapy clinical trials to treat SCID-A patients.\n This project describes the work that Ella will perform throughout the remainder of graduate studies. During\nthe fellowship period, Ella will also undertake a career development plan to prepare for a future career as an\nindependent researcher at an academic institution. This includes support from numerous collaborators to\naccomplish the research objectives, and training in new areas of biological research, such as polymer complex\ndelivery methods, rAAV production, and rigorous in vivo studies to assess the efficacy of SCID-A treatment using\nABE. These experiences, along with programming from the UMN\u2019s Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies\nwill provide Ella with the skills and knowledge necessary to achieve her career goals and desire to perform\nimpactful translational research.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nAntimicrobials are critical for animal and human health, but antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a threat to their\ncontinued effectiveness. Antimicrobial use (AU) is a modifiable risk factor for the emergence and spread of\nAMR, and tracking AU is needed to improve prescribing. Logistical challenges to AU measurement in the\nveterinary field include access to prescribing data held within diverse mutually exclusive electronic health\nrecord (EHR) systems and lack of standard diagnostic coding. The Companion Animal Veterinary Surveillance\nNetwork (CAVSNET), a successful public-private partnership that collects, analyzes, and reports companion-\nanimal veterinary data, overcomes these obstacles through the compilation of non-standardized patient-level\ndata into a standardized common data model (CDM). CAVSNET fulfills a critical need in the fight against AMR,\nproviding data on AU at the point of use (i.e., veterinary clinics) to connect the clinical context, such as disease\nprocess, diagnostic tests, and patient demographics, with prescription data. In addition to discrete data fields,\nunstructured free-text data are available for classification with NLP-PIER, a natural language processing (NLP)\nplatform that enables named-entity recognition and indexing in a secure computing environment; these notes\ncan be mapped to structured categories for analysis. Point-prevalence survey (PPS) methodology, which relies\non detailed manual review of medical records, is structured to collect standardized data from multiple sites over\na specific period of time; PPS are used to provide granular data and augment automated CAVSNET data\ncollection to better understand the complexities of relating AU data to clinical condition. The overarching goal of\nthis project is to harness data from CAVSNET and complementary PPS to analyze AU for dogs, cats, and\nhorses and provide actionable targets for antimicrobial stewardship. Longitudinal AU tracking provides\ninformation needed to target prescribing improvement interventions, can be used to motivate practitioners to\nchange behaviors, and show the profession's progress over time. CAVSNET's public-private partnerships for\nongoing and long-term data collection will 1) characterize and address AU data gaps, 2) collect, standardize,\nand provide annual summaries of AU data, including contextual information and data trends, while maintaining\nveterinary and client confidentiality, 3) share data with the veterinary community and the public, and 5) use a\ncommon data model that lends itself to interoperability. It will provide a comprehensive picture for U.S.\ncompanion animals by 1) providing yearly national estimates of systemic antibiotic use prevalence in\ncompanion animal practices, including contextual demographic information, using CAVSNET, 2) generating\nU.S. estimates of systemic antibiotic use for specific clinical conditions via CAVSNET, and 3) characterizing\nantibiotic use data gaps in companion animal practice and utilizing methods to address gaps, including NLP-\nPIER and national AU PPS for horses and select surgical procedures in dogs and cats.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT: Over 1 million people with cancer live in African countries, 30-40% of whom are people with HIV\n(PWH). Chemotherapy-associated febrile illness is a frequent complication that occurs during cancer treatment\nand is associated with morbidity and mortality. Small-scale studies also suggest that the microbiology of\nchemotherapy-associated febrile illness differs significantly for those living in Africa. For example, our previous\npilot study showed that 19% of Ugandans with solid tumors who developed chemotherapy-associated febrile\nillness tested positive for tuberculosis (TB). Furthermore, PWH have higher rates of chemotherapy-associated\nbone marrow suppression and are at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections when compared\nwith their HIV-negative counterparts. Yet, international guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of chemotherapy-\nassociated febrile illness do not reference any studies conducted in Africa and do not account for the patient\u2019s\nHIV status. Point-of-care (POC) tests are a potentially cost-effective way to identify the microbiologic causes of\nfebrile illness for patients living in low- and middle-income countries. Urinary lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is a\nfirst-line POC test for TB diagnosis among PWH. However, the sensitivity and specificity of urinary LAM has\nnot been evaluated among patients with cancer. Given the high prevalence of HIV and TB throughout Africa, it\nis critical to develop guidelines that incorporate HIV and TB diagnostics among patients with cancer. In this\nstudy, we will use POC tests to develop a cost-effective diagnostic algorithm to guide antimicrobial\nmanagement for patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy in Uganda.\n We proposed to use clinical microbiology diagnostics and next generation metagenomic sequencing to\nunderstand the association between HIV status and the microbiology of chemotherapy-associated febrile\nillness among Ugandan inpatients with solid tumors (Aim 1). We will assess the diagnostic accuracy of urinary\nLAM to detect TB among febrile patients with cancer (Aim 2). Finally, we will create a diagnostic algorithm that\nincorporates the patient\u2019s HIV status and uses POC tests to guide antimicrobial management for patients with\nchemotherapy-associated febrile illness among Ugandan patients with solid tumors to assess an optimal, cost-\neffective diagnostic strategy (Aim 3).\n The proposed research aims will support Dr. Gulleen in meeting her career development training goals\nof 1) gaining proficiency in using metagenomic sequencing, 2) developing expertise in assessing the diagnostic\naccuracy of POC tests among novel populations, and 3) learning principles of cost-effectiveness analysis. The\nK23 award will facilitate her transition to an independent physician-scientist who evaluates and implements\nnovel diagnostic algorithms for managing chemotherapy-related infections among PWH. Dr. Gulleen will\nconduct these activities with outstanding mentorship from experts in global health, metagenomic sequencing,\nclinical laboratory diagnostics, and cost-effectiveness analysis.",

    "abstract_text": "With continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) and viral suppression, life expectancy for people with HIV (PWH)\nis approaching that of people without HIV. Some estimates suggest the mortality gap is 10 years or less, when\ncomparing persons with and without HIV. However, with prolonged survival there have also been increases in\nnon-AIDS defining age-related comorbid diseases. What has now emerged in contemporary HIV clinical care is\na convergence of declining mortality with effective ART treatment, combined with the earlier onset of age-\nrelated comorbidities. This means a growing portion of the lifespan for PWH involves morbidity and disability\nfrom multiple diseases like obesity, diabetes, hepatic steatosis, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Several\nof these comorbidities are related to changes in metabolism, however the mechanism of these changes is not\nunderstood but may be unique to HIV. One common link between HIV and these metabolic diseases is that\nboth are associated with chronic immune activation (IA). For example, people who are obese without HIV have\nelevated levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF. The same is true in treated HIV\ninfection. There are several potential causes of IA including an altered microbiome, microbial translocation, and\nother infections like cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, we and others have shown that HIV RNA+ cells persist\nin lymphatic tissues despite fully suppressive ART, and we think this is a significant contributing cause of IA in\nPWH. Our primary hypothesis is that the size of this dynamic reservoir of HIV RNA+ cells is a primary driver of\nIA which, in turn, leads to development of these metabolic comorbidities. We will test this hypothesis in 2 ways.\nWe will first explore the natural history of metabolic dysfunction in HIV using a large tissue repository of gut\nand lymph nodes (LN) we have collected over the last 20 years in multiple studies. We will measure the size of\nthe HIV reservoir in gut and LN and frequency of hormone producing cells (e.g., GLP-1, PYY, GIP) in HIV\nnegative people and PWH before and during ART and when viral recrudescence with treatment interruption.\nWe will measure markers of IA and microbial translocation in mononuclear cells from those tissues as well as\nplasma that was collected at the time of the biopsy. Collectively, these data will provide insight into how\nmetabolism is altered in HIV infection and the relationship to the size of the HIV viral reservoir. Our second\napproach is to focus on obesity as one of the most common comorbidities in PWH. We will enroll PWH with\nand without obesity (BMI\uf0b330) and HIV-negative people with and without obesity into an 18-month prospective\nobservational study. We will collect LNs, ileal, and colonic samples as well as PBMC and plasma at the\nbaseline and 18-month timepoint. We will collect functional metabolic data with DXA and MRI scans to\nmeasure fat distribution throughout the body and we will do extensive metabolomics and functional genomics\non these same tissues. We will apply machine learning algorithms to this extensive data set to determine the\nrelationship of viral reservoirs to development of obesity as well as other predictors of obesity.",

    "abstract_text": "Life expectancy is a key metric of population health. Yet Black and low-income Americans exhibit much shorter life expectancy than their White, Hispanic, and higher-income counterparts. Housing and neighborhood context are key causes of these mortality differences via interlocking, accumulating social determinants of health at multiple levels across the life course. Yet literature examining how neighborhood context affects mortality remains weak methodologically. It relies on ecologic, cross sectional data; lacks a life course approach; ignores heterogeneity; rarely predicts population impact; and is divorced from policy solutions. Policy relevant levers are sorely needed that can disrupt the complex, upstream knot of family impoverishment. Our study of place-based factors leading to mid-life mortality addresses these limitations, leveraging data from a promising housing policy experiment: The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) Study. The MTO follows 4600 low-income families, living in public housing at baseline (1994-98), in five large US cities, who were randomized to receive one of three treatments: one of two types of housing vouchers to improve housing affordability and neighborhood context or an in-place control group that remained in public housing. The original MTO evaluation concluded in 2010, at which time adults randomized to the housing mobility voucher arm (vs. the other two arms) exhibited improved physical and mental health and improved neighborhood exposures. This study expands and enriches the MTO study by linking it to three administrative datasets through 2024, extending the study 15 additional years\u2014(1) NCHS\u2019s National Death Index, (2) Census Bureau/Social Security\u2019s Numident, and (3) the Census Master Address File\u2014allowing us to analyze the effects of housing policy on mid-life mortality and long-term residential mobility. An experienced and productive social epidemiologist and population health scholar leads this accomplished, interdisciplinary team. Our project has four specific aims: Aim 1: Test if the MTO low-poverty neighborhood housing mobility voucher treatment improves neighborhood opportunity in year 2024, vs. the in-place public housing or traditional voucher group; Aim 2: Test if the MTO low-poverty housing voucher treatment reduces mortality risk through mid-life versus the other 2 treatment groups; Aim 3: Test heterogeneity of MTO effects on mortality by baseline demographic factors (i.e., subgroup effects); Aim 4: Calculate the number of deaths that would be avoided and whether the mortality gap would narrow between groups, at the population level, if voucher-based housing policy were broadly implemented to promote opportunity moves. The proposed project aligns with the NIA Population and Social Processes Branch \u201cMacro-Social Factors\u201d priority area, by estimating population level impacts of a randomized social program. Our study presents a unique and important opportunity for population health: to understand whether housing mobility policy can promote sustained moves to high opportunity neighborhoods, and whether such effects may reduce mid-life mortality risk after 30 years.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAddressing maternal and infant health disparities is an urgent public health concern with profound implications\nfor health equity across the life course. Causes of disparities in maternal morbidity and birth outcomes are\nmultifactorial and arise from an accumulation of short- and long-term environmental, economic, social,\nbehavioral, and biological processes that unfold across the life course. To understand and ultimately address\npregnancy disparities, research needs to move beyond cross-sectional designs at one point in life, to examine\nupstream, place-based, and macrostructural determinants of health that occur much earlier in life, using\nrigorous designs. Neighborhood context is a particularly important macrostructural, distal exposure, which is\ninfluenced by residential segregation, but can be altered through housing policy. The proposed project aims to\nunderstand the impact of housing policy on neighborhood context and infant and maternal outcomes in the\nU.S. To study this critical public health problem, we will leverage data from the Moving to Opportunity (MTO)\nStudy. MTO started as a randomized trial of 16,000 individuals (adults and their children) in 4,600 low-income\nfamilies, living in public housing at baseline, in five U.S. cities. Volunteer families were randomized beginning\nin 1994 to receive one of three treatments: (1) a housing voucher that subsidized rent in apartments located in\nlow-poverty neighborhoods (<10% poverty) plus housing counseling; (2) a housing voucher subsidizing rent in\nany neighborhood; or (3) an in-place control group that received no voucher but remained eligible for public\nhousing. The original MTO study ran from 1994-2010. We propose to link the MTO study participants to\npopulation-based administrative data to extend the study for an additional 15 years until 2024. Linkage with\nuniversal data will enable us to analyze the long-term effects of this experiment on household heads, their\n(now adult) children, and their infant grandchildren. We have four specific aims: (1) Test if MTO treatment\nimproves neighborhood quality (neighborhood opportunity) in 2024; (2) Test if MTO treatment affects maternal\nmorbidity (e.g., hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, obesity); adverse birth events (low\nbirthweight, preterm birth); or fertility (short birth interval, number of births) by 2024; (3) Identify subgroups that\nare more or less likely to benefit from the MTO housing voucher experiment, i.e., test heterogeneity of MTO\neffects on fertility, maternal morbidity and adverse birth outcomes by baseline demographic factors and their\ncombinations (effect modification); and (4) Calculate the number of adverse maternal and infant related events\navoided, and how the racial/ethnic health gap would be narrower, at the population level, if voucher-based\nhousing policy were broadly implemented to promote opportunity moves (simulation). This rigorous, long-term\npopulation health research project aims to achieve health equity across multiple generations of families, by\nimproving housing and neighborhood contexts early in life.",

    "abstract_text": "ADMINISTRATIVE CORE: SUMMARY \nMPC\u2019s Administrative Core maximizes the efficiency of funding for population dynamics research by minimizing \nthe time and energy researchers spend dealing with financial, human resource, and other administrative \nrequirements. The Administrative Core provides leadership by coordinating activities and resources across \ncores. It increases the productivity of MPC members by maintaining excellent facilities and offering cost-effective \nservices and by reducing the administrative burdens of research, particularly those related to grants \nadministration, fiscal management, and human resources. Administrative Core leadership and staff are \nresponsible for the day-to-day operations of the Center and for planning for the continued development of MPC. \nServices fall into five categories: (1) accounting and finance; (2) grants management; (3) human resources; (4) \nfacilities; and (5) communications. \nAccounting and finance: The most critical function of the Administrative Core is coordinating and monitoring all \naspects of MPC finances. Grants management: The Administrative Core provides budget support for proposal \ndevelopment, maintains records of current and pending support, manages IRB and human subjects training, \nmanages subcontracts and consulting agreements, coordinates annual reports, and handles public access \nrequirements (e.g., PubMed Central). Human resources: In addition to efficiently handling routine human \nresources tasks for MPC\u2019s large staff, the Administrative Core exerts considerable effort on recruitment and \nretention of employees. Facilities: The Administrative Core ensures that all research projects have outstanding \nfacilities in which to work. Communications: The Administrative Core communicates members\u2019 research news \nvia traditional and social media. It also keeps members and staff up to date on policies and procedures, informs \nthem of new initiatives and opportunities, and responds to member requests for services. \nThe Administrative Core Lead is MPC Director John Robert Warren. The Administrative Core arranges monthly \nmeetings of the Advisory Board and fortnightly meetings of the Executive Committee. All MPC members are \neligible to use MPC Administrative Core services, although priority is given to new and early stage investigators. \nThe Core also provides services to population dynamics researchers at non-P2C funded institutions. Without the \nAdministrative Core, the most productive MPC researchers would be forced to devote a large percentage of their \ntime to tasks such as human resources and grant administration. This would be an inefficient investment of \nresources, from both a scientific and an economic perspective.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAtherosclerosis is driven by the deposition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol within the\naortic intima, forming a plaque. During plaque formation, monocytes infiltrate the sites of\natherosclerotic lesions where they differentiate into highly heterogeneous macrophage populations,\nincluding lipid-loaded \u201cfoamy\u201d macrophages which are a primary contributor to plaque progression.\nFoamy macrophages are defined by their expression of Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid\nCells 2 (Trem2), a known lipid sensor and key modulating factor of atherosclerosis disease outcomes.\nRecent findings from our lab implicated Trem2 as a key factor modulating atherosclerosis disease\nprogression in vivo. We found that Trem2 mediated foam cell formation, and conditional deletion of\nTrem2 in myeloid cells resulted in increased foam cell death, reduced macrophage proliferation, and\nreduced plaque size. This study was followed by a Trem2 agonism approach, where we found that\nstimulating Trem2 signaling enhanced atherosclerotic lesion burden. Using a Trem2 blocking\nantibody, I will test the hypothesis that Trem2 blockade attenuates atherosclerotic plaque progression\nby limiting macrophage lipid uptake and maintaining cell function. Next, I will tease apart the\nmolecular signaling downstream of Trem2 that mediates foamy macrophage formation. Ultimately, the\nproposed aims will determine mechanisms of Trem2 signaling that reprogram foamy macrophage\nfunction and illuminate the therapeutic potential of a Trem2 blocking antibody in atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe impairment in choline catabolism to its methyl-donor, betaine, is strongly related to the development of\nmetabolic-associated liver disfunction (MASLD). In order for choline to be metabolized, it must be transported\ninto the mitochondrial matrix. However, limitations in the understanding subcellular localization of choline have\nlimited the understanding of choline metabolism in the development of MASLD. My work has identified\nSLC25A48 as a mitochondrial choline carrier (MChoC, SLC25A48) which regulates choline subcellular\nlocalization and metabolism. Elucidating the regulation choline metabolism under obese conditions may reveal\nnovel mechanisms of treating MASLD. This proposal tests the hypothesis that diet induced obesity disrupts\ncholine contribution to the methionine cycle which regulates metabolic health. A first set of studies focuses on\nthe regulation of choline flux in the liver. I will map the fate of choline in the livers of control and MChoC liver-\nspecific knockout (MChoC-LKO) mice through in vivo flux analysis with stable-labeled choline coupled with\nLC/MS. I will also determine whether overexpression of MChoC in livers of obese mice is sufficient to rescue\nfatty liver disease. A second set of studies will focus on choline dependent changes in epigenetics. This set of\nstudies will expand my technical training with support from co-mentor Dr. Evan Rosen. To address the epigenetic\nmodifications dependent on choline metabolism we will assess chromatin architecture regulated through histone\nmethylation and translational control through polysome profiling in MChoC-LKO mice. A third set of studies will\ntest the regulation of obesity on the choline metabolic pathway through proximal-labeling and in vivo complex\nassessment. Completion of these studies will expand the scope of my work, provide foundational datasets, and\nestablish models that will be essential toward achieving my career goal of leading and developing scientists as\nan independent investigator.",

An alternative and ideal approach would be genetic correction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells\n(HSPCs) in vivo, yet base editing therapies require tandem delivery of two component payloads (mRNA encoding\nbase editor protein along with gRNA). Major clinical challenges include safe and effective development of delivery\nsystems for two-component digital base editors, which involves packaging uniformity/stability, formulation\noptimization, safe/effective editing performance in vivo, and collective elucidation/prediction of structure-activity\nrelationships. The objective of this application is to develop a build-test-learn-predict-refine closed loop machine\nlearning (ML)-driven workflow of synthesis, formulation generation, and screening that will optimize micellar\nnanoparticles (MNPs) for binary base editor (gRNA and mRNA expressing adenine base editor, ABE) delivery in\nvitro with a novel engineered cell model and in vivo to HSPCs using a novel genetically humanized SCID-A\nmouse model (all developed by our team). To accomplish this, we will synthesize a novel uniform library of\namphiphilic polymers for blended assembly into MNP vehicles. The proposed work is innovative and unique as\na high throughput workflow will be combined with a novel multi-fidelity ML model to drive our\nsynthesis/formulation strategy that will uniquely correlate chemistry/composition to size/stability (Aim 1), in vitro\n(Aim 2), and in vivo (Aim 3) performance relationships. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: Aim 1. Driven by\nML, a novel library of precise amphiphilic block polymers will be synthesized, assembled into a library of\ncompositions, formulated into MNPs with gRNA and mRNA expressing ABE, quantitatively characterized, and\noptimized for physicochemical properties. Aim 2. A novel engineered SCID-A cell model will enable quantitation\nand correlation of MNP cellular internalization, ABE editing, and toxicity to physicochemical properties via ML to\nidentify and predict structural drivers of performance and safety in vitro. Aim 3. A novel genetically humanized\nSCID-A mouse model will enable quantitation and ML prediction of MNP physicochemical properties to functional\nin vivo ABE editing, immune system recovery, toxicity, and in vitro-in vivo performance trends. Our world-leading\nteam is particularly well suited to undertake the proposed studies providing expertise in polymer synthesis and\nphysicochemical characterization (Reineke), ML and computation (Sarupria), along with in vitro and in vivo model\ndevelopment, ABE therapies, and translational research (Moriarty and McIvor). Our pioneering and versatile\nMNP platform, ML, and biological discovery tools enable our long-term goals of achieving well-defined, safe,\nstable, and effective in vivo base editing therapy for PIDs currently treated by HSCT.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT: Globally, iron deficiency (ID) affects 40-50% of pregnant women, fetuses, and children. Fetal-\nneonatal ID acutely impairs cognitive, motor and social development in children. More troubling from a public\nhealth perspective is that neurobehavioral deficits persist despite neonatal iron treatment, causing increased risk\nof cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders into adulthood. In mice, hippocampal neuron-specific ID causes long-\nterm learning/memory neurocircuit dysfunction despite neonatal iron repletion, demonstrating the long-term\neffects are due to neuronal iron loss during development. The neurobiological mechanisms by which developing\nneurons metabolically adapt to early-life ID and that underly the long-term neurobehavioral deficits are unclear.\n Neuronal development depends on both iron and thyroid hormone (TH) to meet the high energy demands of\nrapid neuronal growth and maturation. Early-life TH deficiency (THD) causes similar neurodevelopmental\nimpairments as ID. Excess iron and TH both cause mitochondrial stress and are toxic. ID is an independent risk\nfactor for THD in pregnant women and children. However, the mechanistic basis for iron/TH interactions during\nbrain development are understudied. We previously showed that fetal-neonatal dietary ID reduces serum and\nbrain TH concentrations and impairs brain TH-regulated gene expression in neonatal rats. Reduced TH activity\nin the neonatal iron-deficient brain is concerning as concurrent deficits in both iron and TH could be maladaptive\nand cause a \u201cdouble hit\u201d to the developing brain and result in poorer outcome than either condition alone.\n However, an alternative hypothesis is that reduced TH action may be adaptive and protect the developing\niron-deficient brain from metabolic stress by balancing the availability of iron, a critical metabolic substrate for\nmitochondrial ATP production with TH-mediated metabolic/growth rate. In support of this \u201cmetabolic matching\u201d\nhypothesis, our published and preliminary data show that iron-deficient neurons have decreased mRNA levels\nfor TH-regulated genes despite normal TH availability, and increased oxidative stress signaling when TH\ntranscriptional activity is experimentally stimulated during ongoing ID. Understanding the neurobiological\nmechanisms underlying this iron/TH interaction and whether ID-induced THD is adaptive or maladaptive to the\ndeveloping iron-deficient brain are critical gaps in knowledge that if addressed would lead to different clinical\nmanagement strategies for early-life ID. In Aim 1, we will determine how iron mechanistically controls neuronal\nTH metabolism and activity during neuronal ID. Aim 2 will determine whether decreased TH activity is adaptive\nor maladaptive for the metabolic and structural development of iron-deficient neurons. Aim 3 will translate our\ncompeting \u201cdouble-hit\u201d and \u201cmetabolic matching\u201d hypotheses to a clinically relevant rodent model of fetal-\nneonatal IDA to determine whether TH treatment is beneficial or detrimental to development and function of the\niron-deficient brain. Our findings will either reveal a paradigm-shifting biological principle of iron/TH metabolic\nmatching or provide a novel target, TH, for developing therapies beyond iron for early-life ID.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY\n Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease caused by the immune mediated destruction of\ninsulin-producing beta cells, significantly impacting human health. Tolerance to beta cells is normally\nmaintained by regulatory T cells (Tregs). In T1D, Tregs stop protecting beta cells and leave them\nvulnerable to immune attack. Work in T1D models has shown that therapeutic restoration of Tregs\ncan prevent disease progression, and clinical studies have shown the safety of this approach in\nhumans. Despite these successes, infusion of polyclonal Tregs has limited clinical efficacy,\nrepresenting key knowledge gaps. These challenges could be solved by creating \u201cdesigner\u201d Tregs\nthat are engineered for islet antigen specificity. If successful, this technology would lead to a more\npersonalized and effective T1D immunotherapy.\n We recently developed an efficient way to generate monoclonal antibodies that recognize peptides\nbound to MHC molecules. Using this approach we created a series of antibodies that are specific for\nislet-reactive peptide-MHCI and peptide-MHCII complexes, called \u2018TCR-mimics\u2019, relevant for\nautoimmunity in NOD mice and humans. We used these reagents as chimeric antigen receptors\n(CAR) to develop Tregs so they were antigen-specific. We demonstrated these CAR Tregs were\nspecific and elicited suppressive functions. In preliminary studies we have shown in vivo feasibility by\npreventing autoimmune diabetes in mice. Our central hypothesis is that re-directing the specificity of\nTregs can be harnessed to prevent and treat T1D. We hypothesize that engineered p:MHC CAR\nTregs will provide superior suppression relative to TCR Tregs in autoimmune diabetes.\n We will test three specific aims; 1) Test efficacy of MHCI and MHCII CAR Treg-mediated\nsuppression in vitro and in vivo, 2) Determine the mechanisms and differential gene expression\nmediating CAR Treg suppression, and 3). Evaluate synergy between CAR Tregs and anti-CD3\ntherapy in autoimmune diabetes. Our innovative approach, using p:MHC mAbs to generate CAR\nTregs targeting islet antigens allows us to determine if engineered antigen-specific Treg will be\noptimal to prevent or reverse T1D pathogenesis. The results from this study will also determine the\nmechanism(s) for suppression for these engineered Tregs. Finally we will compare MHCI- or MHCII-\nrestricted CAR Tregs and determine if both are required for optimal diabetes therapy either alone or\nin combination with anti-CD3 therapy. We are applying our knowledge to human CAR Tregs to test in\npreclinical models and are making additional CAR Tregs monthly. We strongly believe CAR Tregs are\nthe next T1D therapy, and the time to focus on this therapeutic option is now.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY\nType 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease resulting from a breakdown in immunological\ntolerance caused by T cell-mediated destruction of islet beta cells. Diabetes is orchestrated by HLAII-\nrestricted CD4+ T cells, through cellular interactions with both B cells and CD8+ T cells, resulting in\nautoantibody production and beta cell death, respectively. While anti-islet autoantibodies are currently\nthe best predictors of T1D development, screening is limited to four islet antigens and no T cell\nbiomarkers exist. Despite years of research, it is still unclear which antigen-specific CD4+ T cells\ninitiate T1D. New evidence suggests that hybrid peptides (HP) formed from the fusion of islet \u03b2 cell\nproteins may be critical antigens in T1D as recent studies identified HP-reactive CD4+ T cells from\nT1D patients and diabetic mice in vitro. These neo-antigens escape central tolerance and must be\ncontrolled by peripheral mechanisms including anergy or regulatory T cell control. In preliminary\nstudies, we identified HP-specific CD4+ T cells in diabetic mouse models using tetramer reagents,\nand showed they are pathogenic and cause T1D in mouse transfer models. More importantly, we can\nblock spontaneous T1D in the NOD mouse model targeting one hybrid peptide when presented in\nmouse MHCII using peptide-specific:MHCII blocking antibodies. Thus, we hypothesize that HPs are\ncritical antigens and that autoreactivity to HPs initiates T1D. The goals of this proposal are to\ndetermine if HP-specific CD4+ T cells initiate T1D and if targeting them can lead to tolerance as a\nprevention or cure for T1D. The second goal of the grant is to determine if HP specific cells are\nrelevant for human T1D and use of scRNA-seq analysis to uncover critical clues about shared\ntranscriptional programs related to the pathogenic potential between human and mouse HP reactive\nT cells. Completion of this project could lead to better biomarkers to predict T1D risk and disease\nprogression.",

The COVID-OUT trial was a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled\nclinical trial of early outpatient treatment of COVID-19 using a 2x3 factorial design to efficiently test 3 district\ntreatments: metformin, ivermectin, and fluvoxamine. COVID-OUT continued follow-up assessments through 10\nmonths after randomization. This unique long-term follow-up included monthly surveys to assess whether\nparticipants had been diagnosed with long COVID, had persistent or new symptoms, had new diagnoses, new\nmedications, and repeat infections and vaccinations. The COVID-OUT trial also collected and quantified viral\nload from nasal swab samples at baseline, Days 5 and 10. This proposal seeks funding to conduct secondary\nanalyses of already-collected data from the COVID-OUT trial to improve knowledge and understanding about\nlong COVID. The COVID-OUT dataset is uniquely comprehensive with viral load samples and information on\nchronic disease development and progression, and it has less than 2% missingness for clinical outcomes\nduring acute infection, and less than 5% missing long-term data through 9 months. Dr. Bramante started the\nCOVID-OUT trial as a KL2 scholar, and the proposed R03 would support Dr. Bramante\u2019s development into a\nfully independent translational researcher and conducting the proposed analyses will also give Dr. Bramante\nimportant insights into how to balance feasibility of clinical trial conduct and depth of data collected, which will\ninform future clinical trials. Aim 1 will replicate two newly emergent symptom-based definitions of long COVID,\nfrom ACTIV-6 and the RECOVER prospective cohort, in the COVID-Out monthly follow-up data. This will serve\nto understand whether the comparisons of medications versus placebo in the trial are supported across new\ndefinitions of long Covid. These are post-hoc, therefore hypothesis-generating analyses. Aim 1a will assess the\nspecific symptom phenotypes identified in the RECOVER prospective cohort, and present descriptive analyses\nof symptoms at each month after randomization. Aim 2 will create a predictive model of Long COVID using this\ncomprehensive dataset that includes: baseline demographic data, home medications and comorbidities, viral\nload data, outcomes and treatments received during initial acute COVID infection and subsequent infections,\nand vaccinations and boosters received before and after enrollment. This model can be repeated for the long\nCOVID outcomes replicated in Aim 1, and will be important for adding information to the medical literature to\nbetter understand risks associated with developing long Covid. Aim 3 will assess whether changes in sleep,\nphysical activity, and weight effect outcomes during acute COVID-19 infect or during long-term follow-up, as\nsleep, adiposity, and physical activity influence the immune system. The use of existing data for analyses\nproposed in this R03 would address communication and logistical roadblocks that exist when trying to define\nand efficiently research new diseases that arise in pandemic proportions.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nResistance to chemotherapy is a major contributor to cancer relapse and treatment failure. Of many molecular\nmechanisms of cancer therapeutic resistance, increased drug efflux, mediated by ATP-binding cassette\n(ABC) transporters, results in multidrug resistance (MDR) and poses a huge barrier to effective cancer\ntherapy. Small molecule inhibitors of efflux could be used to sensitize cancer cells toward chemotherapeutic\ntreatment and improve treatment quality. Significantly, we have identified a highly potent lead compound, a\ndeazaflavin analog which at single digit nanomolar concentrations drastically increased the intracellular\nconcentration of etoposide (ETP), and to a lesser extent, that of teniposide and pemetrexed, all are important\ncancer chemotherapeutics. Our prior studies revealed that it is a potent inhibitor of MRP1. Notably, it displayed\nexcellent selectivity over other major ABC transporters, including P-gp, BCRP, MRP2 and MRP3, and fully\nreversed the MRP1-mediated drug resistance to ETP and doxorubicin in H69AR small cell lung cancer cells.\nIn addition, it exhibited desirable PK in preliminary mice testing without altering distribution of co-administered\nETP to normal tissues in healthy mice, and hence may have limited toxicological consequences. These\npreliminary findings strongly suggest this lead and its analogs could be a highly valuable lead series for\ndeveloping combination treatments with clinical TOP2 poisons or other anticancer drugs. The objectives of\nthis grant application are to examine a library of deazaflavin analogs for MRP1 inhibiting activity and to further\nevaluate their potential for cancer chemotherapy sensitization in in vitro and in vivo models, by pursuing these\nspecific aims: Aim 1. to screen and characterize deazaflavin analogs for MRP1 inhibition using membrane\nvesicle-based and cell-based drug transport assays. In this aim, we will screen an in-house deazaflavin analog\nlibrary (~30 synthetic analogs) using vesicular transport assay and cell-based calcein retention assay for\nMRP1 inhibitory activity and characterize their potency, selectivity as well as examine the structure-activity\nrelationship (SAR). We will also perform site-directed mutagenesis on MRP1 to identify residues that may be\ncritical for the inhibitory effect of the analogs. Aim 2. to evaluate the deazaflavin analogs for cancer chemo-\nsensitization in in vitro and in vivo models. In this aim, we will first evaluate advanced analogs for chemo-\nsensitization in a panel of lung cancer and neuroblastoma cells toward selected chemotherapeutics and\nestablish correlations to the MRP1 protein expression and inhibition. We will then profile the in vivo toxicity of\nour top analogs in mice, and further evaluate the anti-tumor effect and toxicological consequence of the\nanalogs in combination with TOP2 poison ETP in a xenograft mouse model of multidrug resistant lung cancer.\nAt the conclusion of the studies outlined in this proposal, a better understanding of the mechanism of action\nand the chemotherapeutic sensitizing potential of our lead compounds will be gained, which will lay a solid\nfoundation for future preclinical studies.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\n Compared with dialysis, kidney transplant recipients have significantly better survival and quality of life. In\nthe last 2 decades, short-term posttransplant patient and kidney transplant survival have improved. However,\nthere has not been a similar improvement in long-term survival. Within 10 years after a kidney transplant, about\n47% of deceased donor and about 30% of living donor transplants have failed. The 2 most common cause of\nlate kidney transplant failure are: a) premature death despite adequate kidney transplant function; and b) slow\nprogressive decline in function of the transplant, eventually resulting in kidney failure. Our goal is to improve\nlong-term outcomes after kidney transplantation.\n In the general population, for patients with cardiovascular disease, heart failure and/or chronic kidney\ndisease, a new class of drugs, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), significantly reduce death,\ncardiovascular disease and progression of native kidney disease. Thus, these drugs may have a major impact\non the two most common reasons for late posttransplant kidney failure. This class of drugs are now\nrecommended for persons in the general population with heart disease and/or chronic kidney disease.\nHowever, for immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients there has been concern about whether these\ndrugs will have similar benefits, and whether there will be an unacceptable risk of side effects. As a result,\nkidney transplant recipients have been excluded from large randomized trials of SGLT2is. Because of the\nconcerns about the efficacy and side effects of these drugs in transplant recipients, and the lack of information\nfrom large trials, reviews and national and international medical guidelines state that before recommending\nSGLT2is for transplant recipients, large long-term randomized trials need to be done.\n We propose a prospective randomized trial (n=900) of a SGLT2i (dapagliflozin), compared with placebo, to\nstudy efficacy and safety of this drug in kidney transplant recipients. Enrolled participants will be followed for a\nminimum of 3 years. Our hypothesis is that dapagliflozin will be safe in kidney transplant recipients and will\nreduce death and cardiovascular disease while prolonging kidney transplant function. To maximize enrollment\nand diversity, we plan a pragmatic trial with no extra visits to the transplant center and minimal study-related\nlaboratory tests. This will facilitate participation for those at long distances from a transplant center and/or\nthose with difficulty in finding transportation.\n This trial represents a unique opportunity to profoundly impact the care of kidney transplant recipients.\nShowing that dapagliflozin improves survival after a transplant and reduces cardiovascular disease and\nprogression of kidney disease will transform clinical care in this high-risk population.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract:\n The evolution of antimicrobial drug resistance is an urgent threat to public health. A better understanding\nof basic evolutionary principles in microorganisms can inform efforts to identify, prevent, and combat the\nemergence of drug resistance. Candida albicans, one of the most common fungal pathogens, can adapt to\nantifungal drugs via mutations that alter gene expression levels. Gene expression levels can be altered by\nchanges in gene copy number and mutations that alter transcriptional regulatory networks. Basic science\ninvestigating the influence of gene copy number changes on fitness and the impact on the gene regulatory\nnetwork across diverse genetic backgrounds is needed. These investigations will directly contribute to combating\nthe emergence of antifungal drug resistance.\n The objective of the proposed research is to test the effects of copy number changes on fitness and gene\nregulatory networks, and relate these effects to the rate and dynamics of the evolution of antifungal drug\nresistance in C. albicans. In the long-term, this work can be extended to additional fungal pathogens and related\nto clinical sampling data, as well as inform general evolutionary biology principles that can be tested and applied\nacross the tree of life. Aim 1 uses newly developed CRISPR-activation technology in C. albicans to test the\nfitness effects of gene overexpression in multiple genetic backgrounds and environments. These data will be\nused to describe the distribution of fitness effects of recurrently amplified genes. Aim 2 combines CRISPR-\nactivation technology with single-cell RNA-sequencing to model transcriptional regulatory networks. These will\nbe used to identify genome-wide transcriptional effects of gene amplification in diverse genetic backgrounds and\nenvironments. Aim 3 uses experimental evolution to test the hypothesis that a gene\u2019s position within the\nregulatory network influences the rate and dynamics of adaptive gene expression change in resistance genes.\n The long-term career goals of the candidate are to establish a research program centered around genetic\nconstraints and facilitations to evolutionary adaptation at a major biomedical research institution. The short-term\ntraining goals of this proposal are to further develop the candidate\u2019s expertise in the computational representation\nof regulatory networks and in the application of single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies to pathogenic yeast.\nThe University of Minnesota provides an ideal environment in which to pursue these training goals, with excellent\nresources for career development, extensive genomics and computing core facilities, and faculty with expertise\nin genomic networks, evolutionary biology, and microbiology that will serve as mentors and advisors to the\ncandidate. The training and research proposed will launch the candidate into an independent and productive\nresearch career.",

Two\ndistinct approaches to using aryl and alkyl nitriles for the synthesis of enantioenriched quaternary stereocenters\nand nitrogen-containing heterocycles, respectively, are proposed. The medicinal properties of molecules bearing\nquaternary centers have drawn particular attention, as a significant positive correlation exists between the\nnumber of stereogenic centers with clinical success. However, the construction of these structural motifs with a\nhigh degree of stereocontrol, especially in the synthesis of spiro centers, remains a significant challenge in\norganic synthesis. The goal of the proposed research is to access sterically congested, spirocyclic quaternary\ncenters in a stereoselective manner by means of nickel-catalyzed acylation reactions of lactones (K99). Reaction\noptimization and substrate scope studies will first be performed to establish the desired reactivity with aryl nitriles.\nUpon validating the desired reactivity with aryl nitriles experimentally, computations will be performed to\nunderstand the reaction mechanism and help guide substrate scope expansion to alkyl nitriles.\n Secondly, the chemical properties of aryl nitriles will be applied toward the synthesis of nitrogen-containing\nheterocycles (R00), which are considered critically important as more than half of the top 20 best-selling small\nmolecule drugs and nearly 60% of all small molecule drugs possess them. Traditional approaches to C\u2013N bond\nformation rely on transition-metal catalyzed transformations, such as Chan-Lam coupling, Buchwald\u2013Hartwig\namination, and Ullmann reaction. Given that most of these metal-catalyzed reactions require the use of high\ntemperatures and pre-functionalized starting materials, the transition to radical-based C\u2013N bond formation, which\ncan use mild conditions and simpler starting materials, is highly desirable. My goal is to establish an independent\nresearch program focused on studying boryl radical chemistry for the generation of nitrogen-centered radicals\nand regiodivergent hydroamination of trisubstituted alkenes (R00). This project will involve 1) initial computations\non key mechanistic steps to help identify NHC boranes that allow for regioselective formation of azepine and\nisoquinoline scaffolds and 2) experimental testing of computational predictions, reaction optimization, and\nsubstrate scope studies. Overall, computational analyses of reaction mechanism and the origins of stereo- or\nregioselectivity in the aforementioned transformations will provide a platform to expand the utility of Ni catalysis\nfor enantioselective synthesis of spirocyclic scaffolds and the application of boryl radical chemistry for C\u2013N bond\nformation.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary / Abstract\nDespite widespread use of buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder (OUD), 50% of patients return to use\nwithin months. Non-invasive prefrontal stimulation is a highly promising buprenorphine augmentation strategy\nto enhance prefrontal plasticity to boost executive functioning (EF) needed for recovery. We reported that a\nneuromodulation intervention combining prefrontal stimulation and EF training delivered to individuals with\nalcohol use disorder increased prefrontal-incentive salience network connectivity and resulted in a significant\nreduction in relapse rates. This intervention has not yet been tested as a buprenorphine augmentation strategy\nfor OUD. This proposal investigates the added benefit of the intervention in individuals under buprenorphine\nmaintenance treatment for OUD (bOUD) to determine whether this intervention can: (i) induce circuit-based\ntarget engagement, (ii) enhance EF, and (iii) improve treatment outcomes. UG3 phase, open-label, within-\nsubjects. Deliver 10 days of active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to individuals with bOUD\nconcurrent with cognitive training. Brain imaging data and EF performance will be collected at pre-, mid- and\npost-intervention. UG3 aims to determine if there is a dose-dependent tDCS effect by contrasting change from\nbaseline after 5 vs after 10 tDCS sessions in the following metrics: (SA1) circuit-based target engagement of a\nprefrontal-incentive salience network associated with abstinence and (SA2) EF improvement, i.e. working\nmemory, cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, decision making. SA3 will involve a pre-submission meeting with\nthe FDA and NIH to review and obtain feedback on: regulatory process, UH3 design and study endpoints. UH3\nphase, randomized-controlled trial, between-subjects. With FDA feedback and UG3-determined dose, a\nbetween-subjects, triple-blind, randomized-controlled clinical trial will assign 120 individuals with bOUD to\neither active tDCS or sham concurrent with cognitive training. We will collect brain imaging and EF changes at\npre- and post- intervention, treatment outcome measures at 1-, 3- and 6-month follow-up timepoints. UH3 aims\nto contrast active tDCS vs sham groups on (SA4) clinical efficacy and durability of active tDCS on treatment\noutcome (craving, opioid use) over the 6-month follow-up period. To examine intermediate factors playing a\nkey role in the intervention\u2019s mechanism of action, we will (SA5) determine the relationship between changes\nin target engagement, EF and treatment outcomes. The UH3 is positioned to be in Phase 2 of the FDA\nRegulatory Pathway, to design either a Phase 2 or 3 Clinical Trial to support a Premarket Approval application.\nImpact: We propose the first study to examine the added benefit of a non-invasive prefrontal neuromodulation\nintervention designed as a highly promising buprenorphine augmentation strategy to dually target executive\nfunctioning deficits and excessive craving in individuals with bOUD. Success in these aims would provide\ncrucial information about this combined intervention, setting the stage for clinical translation of a low-cost,\nscalable, neuroscience-based treatment for OUD.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nAtrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia and its prevalence is increasing. Accumulating\nevidence suggests that upstream to atrial fibrillation, structural, mechanical, or electrophysiological changes in\nthe atria\u2014collectively known as atrial myopathy\u2014may be a primary mediator of heart failure, ischemic stroke,\nand mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, the pathophysiology of atrial myopathy is incompletely\nunderstood, there are currently no targeted therapies, and treatment targets suggested by human population\nstudies remain unvalidated experimentally. Therefore, treatment target validation and understanding the\npathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to atrial myopathy are unmet needs. This project aims to fill this\ngap by identifying novel treatment targets through large-scale human data analysis and by investigating the\nprotective role of the protein DLK1 in atrial myopathy. The primary aim leverages human cohort data to identify\ncandidate treatment targets by discovering circulating proteins and metabolites linked to both left atrial function\nand atrial myopathy. By combining traditional multivariable linear regression analyses with advanced\ngenomics-based causal inference methods, we aim to prioritize promising targets for further preclinical\ninvestigation, ultimately paving the way for novel atrial myopathy therapies and improved clinical atrial\nfibrillation management. Because prior studies suggest DLK1 protects against fibrosis and inflammation and\nour preliminary data found that higher levels are associated with better left atrial function. The secondary aim\nof this project will investigate DLK1's role in mouse models of atrial myopathy, testing if increasing atrial DLK1\nexpression improves left atrial function and if decreasing atrial DLK1 expression impairs left atrial function.\nAiming to become an independent physician-scientist in atrial fibrillation and atrial myopathy research and to\nbridge population and basic science, the applicant seeks K08 funding for protected time to solidify his skillset in\ncharacterization of cardiac fibrosis, interrogation of atrial pathophysiology, and Mendelian randomization for\ncausal inference. This protected research time will give the applicant an opportunity to build his research\nprogram, gather preliminary data, and ultimately secure R01 funding to establish himself as an independent\ninvestigator in the cardiovascular field. The applicant has also assembled an accomplished and well-funded\nmultidisciplinary mentoring team, comprised of internationally known experts in the fields of atrial fibrillation and\natrial myopathy epidemiology, cardiomyocyte biology, cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction, and Mendelian\nrandomization. With their support and guidance, and the research infrastructure available at University of\nMinnesota, the applicant is well-positioned to achieve his proposed research aims and accomplish his stated\ncareer development goals. The applicant\u2019s clinical expertise in multi-modality cardiovascular imaging aligns\nperfectly with his research goals, enabling him to investigate novel biomarkers and translate research findings\nto improve patient care.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThe overarching goal of the research in my lab is to make genetics research generalizable to diverse\npopulations, thereby improving our fundamental understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases.\nWe are particularly interested in studying how and why disease risk varies across human populations and\nwhether this is due to variation in genetic risk. Unfortunately, because of the Eurocentric representation\nin genome-wide association studies (GWAS), our catalog of disease-causing variants, our understanding\nof their effects, and our ability to predict genetic risk from them is limited, particularly for individuals of\nnon-European ancestry. To rectify this imbalance, several large-scale efforts seeking to diversify study\nparticipants are underway across the globe, including here in the United States through the NIH All of\nUs program. While these are welcome and exciting developments, the increasing genetic complexity of\nthese cohorts raises methodological challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize their potential.\nOur goal over the next five years is to understand these challenges and develop statistical tools to solve\nthem. For example, it is common practice in GWAS and genetic risk prediction to group individuals from\ndiverse cohorts by genetically-defined ancestry (e.g. African, European) to be analyzed separately. This\npractice is primarily motivated by a need to reduce the confounding effects of population structure \u2013 a\nwell-known problem that introduces biases in GWAS. But splitting diverse cohorts into ancestry groups\nis (i) arbitrary, running the risk of reifying racial categories, (ii) reduces the effective sample size, leading\nto an overall loss in discovery power and an increase in the uncertainty of effect estimates, especially for\ngenetic variants that might underlie health disparities, and (iii) can introduce errors when making genetic\npredictions, raising the risk of misdiagnosis, especially for under-represented populations. In fact, my\nprevious research has shown that the problem of population structure persists, even in \u2018homogeneous\u2019\npopulations, suggesting that we cannot avoid it and need to deal with it head on. This raises several\nfundamental questions: Is it actually necessary to split diverse cohorts by ancestry? What is the evidence\nfor that? How do we maximize the power of diverse cohorts while minimizing false-positive associations\ndue to their complex genetic structure? My lab will combine rigorous theoretical modeling and empirical\ndata analysis to answer these questions and develop a statistical framework to fully leverage human\ngenetic diversity to empower genetic discovery and risk prediction.",

In Aim 1, I will carry out empirically-guided\nsimulations to investigate how fine-scale substructure in large genome-wide association studies\n(GWAS; e.g. UK Biobank) biases our inference of complex trait architecture and polygenic risk\nscore prediction. I will leverage these findings to develop statistical and computational tools to\ncorrect for such biases. In Aim 2, I will investigate whether recent admixture in humans generates\nincompatibilities between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA in African Americans. To test this, I will\nanalyze genetic and electronic health record data from the ethnically diverse Penn Medicine\nBiobank to test whether mito-nuclear discordance\u2014degree of ancestry divergence between\nmitochondrial and nuclear genomes\u2014is associated with the risk of diseases common among\nAfrican Americans. Additionally, I will test for selection against mito-nuclear incompatibilities in\nrecently admixed populations. In Aim 3, I will investigate how the practice of endogamy and\nconsanguinity among Pakistanis shapes their disease risk architecture. I will further evaluate the\nability and limitations of currently used GWAS methods, which are typically modeled after outbred\npopulations, to infer disease architecture given the complex population structure in Pakistanis. I\nwill improve upon these methods, thereby making GWAS more widely applicable to a diverse set\nof people. Each of my three aims is independent, yet together they will lead to improvements in\ndiagnosis, treatment, and prevention of human diseases\u2014the overarching mission of the NIGMS.\nI will learn the skills needed to accomplish these aims with the help of my advisory committee,\ncomprising of Drs. Iain Mathieson, Sarah Tishkoff, Doug Wallace, and Marilyn Ritchie, who are\nworld-class leaders in genetics research. With the training plan that I have outlined and the\nresources at the University of Pennsylvania, I am confident that the K99 award will help me\nachieve my goal of becoming an independent scientist in the field of statistical genetics.",

NIA\u2019s investment in a Coordinating Center is only justified if it increases the efficiency, productivity, and impact of the collective group of D&E Centers beyond what they can accomplish in isolation. We propose an exciting, interactive, and dynamic new vision for what the D&E CC can do for the D&E Centers, for NIA, and for the community of researchers worldwide who will leverage our resources to shape the next generation of research on the demography and economics of aging and AD/ADRD. We will do this by (1) serving as the administrative hub of the D&E Centers; (2) facilitating synergistic collaborations to catalyze impactful aging research; (3) expanding the impact of the D&E Centers\u2019 research through effective dissemination; and (4) coordinating tracking and reporting to reduce redundant effort and increase productivity. The suite of activities we propose leverages the many strengths, assets, expertise, and programming of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Institute for Social Research and Data Innovation to coordinate and enhance the activities of the individual D&E Centers; the objective is to make the whole more productive and impactful than the sum of its parts. The NIA DECC will create and support a vibrant nationwide community of aging and AD/ADRD scholars that is better informed, supported, and connected to address urgent aging-related problems.

We will coordinate, organize, and catalyze the individual D&E Centers\u2019 efforts to recruit and support Emerging Scholars. The NIA DECC will be led by an interdisciplinary MPI team that has, for more than a decade, collaborated to successfully develop, implement, grow, and sustain multiple research centers, major research projects, training programs, professional development programs, and initiatives to help early career scholars develop their research agendas and funding portfolios. We envision the NIA DECC as a central hub of innovation, information exchange, and new ideas and collaborations, connecting the D&E Centers to one another, to NIA, to other NIA P30-funded networks (e.g., the Roybal Centers, the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Centers), to policymakers, and to the public.

Rationale: Effectively addressing\ncomplex public health problems requires training a new generation of scientists who view biological, social,\neconomic, spatial, and policy factors as interacting over multiple time scales to shape population health.\nUnfortunately, training programs usually prioritize etiologic research over investigations of effective solutions,\nand most new scientists are trained only in the biological, social, or health care system influences on disease;\nfew are trained to integrate all three. Objectives: We seek continued support for a pre- and postdoc training\nprogram in population health science that produces scientists who understand complex health problems and\nhealth disparities as resulting from multiple and interacting layers of influence that unfold over chronological,\nbiological, and historical time. Design: The program features cross-training in (a) the biology and etiology of\ndisease and (b) social sciences and policy contexts that shape disease. The program includes required\ncoursework (for predocs only) in population health science, population modeling, and the responsible conduct of\nresearch; independent and collaborative research supervised by interdisciplinary teams of faculty mentors;\nrequired Scholar Development Meetings, workshops, and participation in interdisciplinary population health\nconferences; and intensive professional socialization designed to integrate trainees from diverse disciplinary\nbackgrounds and prepare them to have outstanding careers as population health scientists. Trainee Outcomes:\nWe train population health scientists to integrate knowledge, theory, and tools from multiple disciplines to conduct\ncutting edge research on the intersecting biological and social factors that shape health and to produce novel\nsolutions to the nation\u2019s most pressing public health issues. Appointments: We request five predoc (3-year) and\nthree postdoc (2-year) training slots; this represents an increase in training slots from the previous project period\n(from four predoc and two postdoc slots). Our request for more training slots is based on the extraordinary\nsuccess of our program in the first project period. Leadership: The program is co-directed by population health\nscholars John Robert Warren (Sociology) and Theresa Osypuk (Epidemiology & Community Health). They are\nsupported by an internal Executive Committee, an external Advisory Board of nationally recognized population\nhealth scientists, and an outstanding team of 49 faculty mentors from five colleges and twelve disciplinary\ndepartments. Progress: In the first five years of the program, we successfully placed all alumni trainees in\npopulation health research positions; our trainees were extremely successful in publishing, competing for\nresearch funds; and developing identities as interdisciplinary population health researchers.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, and is associated with elevated risk of\nchronic health conditions including dementia. Cerebral edema is a particularly deleterious complication of TBI\nwhich greatly increases risk of death, but current clinical approaches for edema management do not lead to signif-\nicant improvements in patient outcomes. Recent translational studies of TBI in mice demonstrate that trigeminal\nnerve stimulation (TNS) offers a low-risk, noninvasive therapeutic approach that reduces edema and improves\nfunctional outcomes. However, stimulation parameters vary widely across studies, and the mechanisms of edema\nreduction are not well-understood. The research proposed herein seeks to utilize both mouse experiments and\nrealistic numerical simulations to probe stimulation parameter sensitivity and obtain a mechanistic understanding\nof how nerve stimulation leads to edema reduction. Such insights are necessary for rapid and effective trans-\nlation of TNS-based therapies, and indeed, results from this research will help inform upcoming TNS studies in\nhumans. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that TNS improves functional outcomes after TBI by enhanc-\ning extracellular \ufb02uid transport through the glymphatic system (a pathway in which cerebrospinal \ufb02uid exchanges\nwith interstitial \ufb02uid in the brain). Four lines of evidence support this hypothesis: (1) a recent Nature publica-\ntion demonstrates that restoring disrupted glymphatic transport following TBI removes excess \ufb02uid and cortical\ndebris, sharply reducing neuroin\ufb02ammation and improving functional outcomes; (2) glymphatic \ufb02ow is driven by\narterial pulsations, and prior TNS studies use pulsed stimulation that enhances arterial pulsatility; (3) prior work\nshows that stimulation of the vagus nerve enhances glymphatic transport; and (4) multiple studies show analo-\ngous sensory (e.g., whisker) stimulation alters cortical blood \ufb02ow and enhances glymphatic transport. Speci\ufb01c\nAim 1 will test the central hypothesis by measuring brain-wide glymphatic in\ufb02ux due to variable TNS parameters\n(stimulation frequency, intensity, duty cycle) and will yield a near-optimal parameter set corresponding to maxi-\nmum glymphatic transport. Speci\ufb01c Aim 2 will provide the \ufb01rst high-resolution, in vivo quanti\ufb01cation of changes in\narterial diameter and glymphatic transport during TNS. This will be achieved using two-photon microscopy while\nTNS is administered with near-optimal parameters. Speci\ufb01c Aim 3 will leverage an existing, versatile simulation\nof the murine glymphatic system to causally establish the extent to which increased arterial pulsatility enhances\nglymphatic transport. Results from this study will: (1) conclusively demonstrate whether TNS ameliorates acute\npost-TBI edema via enhanced glymphatic transport, (2) yield a set of near-optimal TNS parameters, (3) directly\nquantify TNS-induced alterations to blood/glymphatic \ufb02ow, and (4) quantify the extent to which increased glym-\nphatic transport due to sensory/nerve stimulation may be attributed to increased arterial pulsatility. Importantly,\nthis study will have direct translational value: research results will help guide upcoming human studies in which\nTNS will be administered to humans using a noninvasive, wearable device with potential for commercialization.",

    "abstract_text": "Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Naselaris, Thomas\nPROJECT SUMMARY\nWe propose to amass a large sampling brain activity as humans internally generate mental images. The\nproposed Mental Imagery Database (MID) will use high-resolution 7T fMRI to achieve large-scale sampling\nof brain activity during mental imagery, a timely project directly motivated by the rise of generative AI. Of\nthe many use cases we envision, we see two as especially urgent: (1) MID will be used by neuroscientists\nand AI researchers to gain insights into how the brain transforms text into novel visual representations. This\noperation is central to current AI research and distinguishes humans from other biological intelligences.\nAlthough AI image generators have become better at making pictures than most humans, they still struggle\nwith visual interpretations of written information that humans find easy. Very little is currently known about\nhow human brains do this. MID will provide the needed neuroimaging data at a scale that is matched to the\ncomplexity of the problem. (2) MID will advance recent work on visual decoding that has made great strides\nreconstructing seen images. Such work is hampered by the lack of data for cross-generalization to mental\nimagery. Using MID to fine-tune vision decoders for mental imagery would bring us closer to viable\ntechnology for externalizing visual thoughts. This technology could be deployed by clinicians to help\npatients interrogate and control intrusive mental images of traumatic events, and aid diagnosis and\ncommunication for unresponsive patients whose consciousness is not readily apparent through standard\nbehavioral assessments. Decoding such patients' mental images could, in principle, affirm consciousness\nand aid in accurate diagnoses.\nRELEVANCE\nWe expect this work to deliver a method for producing high-quality reconstructions of visual mental images.\nThis work will impact the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders that are driven by\ndysregulated visual mental imagery. Little is known about the brain systems that mediate mental imagery's\nrole in mental health, in part because of the paucity of high-quality mental imagery data, which the\nproposed Mental Imagery Database will provide.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThe long term goal of our research is to understand the computational role of mental imagery in\nhuman cognition, and to operationalize this understanding to provide new tools for improving\nmental health. For most people, mental imagery is experienced as visual content that is\nindependent of vision but indispensable for thought. This experience suggests that mental\nimagery serves an important cognitive function; however, studies of the brain systems that\ngenerate mental imagery have yet to reveal how or if mental images contribute to cognition. In\nthis proposal, we test the hypothesis that mental imagery supports cognition by permitting the\ncomparison of seen to unseen images. The comparison of seen and unseen images is a routine\noperation that occurs, for example, when one judges how a seen image differs from a\nremembered image, or from a target image that one wants to detect. To test this hypothesis we\nwill measure brain activity in people as they imagine and as they complete a variety of tasks that\nrequire them to compare pictures displayed on a screen to pictures that they have been asked\nto remember. Using techniques borrowed from artificial intelligence (AI) we will extract from\nthese data information about individual mental images, and then determine if this information\ncan predict brain activity and behavior during the tasks. If successful, this proposal will establish\na functional and computational role for imagery. Since very little is currently known about the\nfunction of mental imagery, our work is an essential step toward understanding how mental\nimagery interacts with and supports cognition, and how disregulated mental imagery can disrupt\nmental health.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThe Src-family kinase Lyn is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis and protecting against autoimmunity,\nand deficits in Lyn function are linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, cellular studies report\nconflicting (paradoxical) inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions, varying by cell and perturbation. We\nhave discovered that the two Lyn splice forms (A, B) are differentially regulated, suggesting non-overlapping\ninteractions and roles The apparently paradoxical positive and negative effects might be explained by isoform-\nspecific functions that vary with expression, immune compartment, and environment. We generated single-iso-\nform LynAKO and LynBKO mice and discovered (1) a dominant role for LynB in protecting against autoimmunity\nand (2) a female-specific role for LynA in immune regulation. Our preliminary data point to overlapping roles of\nLynA and LynB in steady-state ITIM signaling but a specific role for LynB in inducing antimicrobial hemi-ITAM\nsignaling. To this toolkit we add a reagent that biases splicing toward increased LYNB production in human cells.\nWe hypothesize LynB uniquely functions in ITAM and TLR pathways, while LynA suppresses ER (estrogen-\nreceptor) signaling, accounting for the sexual dimorphism. Alterations in LynA and LynB expression may explain\nthe apparently paradoxical observations of net positive and negative functions and suggest a path forward for\ntherapeutic development. We aim to 1: Assess roles of LynA and LynB in ITAM, TLR, and ER signaling in\nhuman and murine myeloid cells. As myeloid cells drive autoimmunity and have been targets of immunomod-\nulatory therapies, they will be the focus of signaling studies. Candidate and unbiased kinase-substrate mapping\nand interactomics in macrophages and DCs will provide a comprehensive profile of LynA and LynB substrates\nand functions in receptor activation. Predictions: LynB will interact stably with ITAM and TLR signaling complexes\nand downstream mediators, whereas LynA will uniquely suppress ER signaling. LynA and LynB will be found to\nlocalize differently at the cell membrane, explaining why upregulation of the other isoform fails to rescue signal-\ning. 2: Probe isoform- sex-, and cell-specific mechanisms of Lyn dysregulation in lupus progression. We\nwill assess progression of lupus in spontaneous and inducible models in male and female mice from our Lyn\nknockout series. WT and LynKO experiments will be repeated mice with ovariectomy and with pharmacological\nantagonism/agonism of estrogen and progesterone signaling to pinpoint contributors to sexual dimorphism. We\nwill assess cell-specific contributions to disease in bone-marrow chimeras. Finally, we will test the ability of a\nsplice-altering reagent to suppress disease. Predictions: Upregulation of a single isoform will partially suppress\nlupus, cell-specificity will follow LynA/B expression patterns, sex hormones will drive lupus in females, and alter-\ning LynA/B balance will modulate disease. With our Lyn knockout series, we are poised to resolve longstanding\nparadoxes in Lyn signaling. Our Lyn splice reagent adds translational value, testing a new therapeutic avenue.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nSexually reproducing organisms use meiosis to distribute one copy of each homologous chromosome pair to\ndeveloping gametes. This relies on the formation of physical linkages between chromosomes known as\ncrossovers, and crossover errors are a leading cause of infertility and conditions such as Down syndrome.\nAccordingly, while crossovers appear at random genomic positions in each meiosis, they are tightly regulated to\nensure each chromosome pair receives at least one crossover and that crossovers beyond the first are well-\nseparated along the length of the chromosomes. Yet while these phenomena were first observed over a century\nago, the mechanism by which crossover locations are coordinated along chromosomes remains hotly debated.\nTo investigate this longstanding question, our lab recently pioneered the use of single-molecule imaging to track\nthe motion of proteins known to regulate crossover formation. We found that these proteins are recruited by and\nmove along a nanoscale protein assembly between the chromosomes known as the synaptonemal complex,\nallowing them to coordinate their activity at sites millions of base pairs apart. Our current research program works\nto understand how dynamics in this liquid-like compartment create emergent patterns of crossovers.\nIn our first major research direction, we will study the proteins required for crossovers to form. One leading theory\nof crossover patterning proposes that the distribution of crossovers along chromosomes emerges from\ncompetition between sites to recruit enough of these proteins to form crossovers. To explore this possibility, we\nwill evaluate how quickly and how far different proteins can move along chromosomes, how proteins bind to\npotential crossover sites, and what regulates these dynamics. Using our precise measurements of diffusion and\nbinding kinetics, we will use computer modeling to understand how these dynamics collectively generate tightly\nregulated crossover numbers and spacing, and how mutations in these proteins disrupt regulation.\nIn our second major research direction, we will study the dynamic properties of the synaptonemal complex itself.\nAs a liquid-like assembly, small genetic perturbations or changes in environmental conditions can alter the\nmaterial properties of the synaptonemal complex and drastically impair fertility. We will study how structural\nchanges and shifts in temperature alter the function of the synaptonemal complex, as well as how the\nsynaptonemal complex in turn is patterned and internally organized by the formation of crossovers.\nAltogether, our research program will uncover fundamental mechanisms of how crossovers are regulated and\nhow molecular activity along chromosomes is spatially patterned. The insights provided from this research are\ncritical for understanding how infertility and birth defects arise in humans and how liquid-like compartments\norganize the nucleus, with implications for related diseases such as errors in DNA repair in cancer.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nDopamine (DA) is a critical neuromodulator for mood, motivation, and reward-based learning. Dysregulated DA\ndynamics across brain regions and timescales contribute to psychiatric and substance use disorders, yet how\nDA timescales mediate the relationship between learning and motivation remains unresolved. Striatal DA\nrelease is documented to fluctuate on fast \u201cphasic\u201d and slower \u201ctonic\u201d timescales, hypothesized to regulate\nlearning and motivation, respectively. Prevailing reinforcement learning (RL) theories suggest that phasic DA\ntransients encode reward prediction errors (RPEs), which diffuse and accumulate into tonic DA levels to\nregulate motivational engagement. This interpretation assumes that subjective values driving motivational\nengagement are reactive to recent reward exposure. However, alternative theories propose that tonic DA may\narise independently from phasic DA, reflecting proactive effort allocation based on internal calculations rather\nthan recent reward exposure. Resolving these conflicting views is essential for understanding DA\u2019s role in\nmotivation and its dysfunction in psychopathology. This proposal aims to define the circuit and computational\nmechanisms linking phasic and tonic DA to flexible motivational engagement. Using a novel broadband DA\nmeasurement technique we recently developed, I will analyze how DA dynamics across timescales interact to\nsupport reactive-vs-proactive motivational flexibility. Aim 1 will assess how these valuation processes influence\nthe relationship between phasic and tonic DA. Aim 2 will identify circuit mechanisms regulating how phasic DA\nsignals accumulate into tonic levels under varying task demands of reactive-vs-proactive value learning. These\nstudies will reconcile longstanding theoretical debates on DA function, providing a mechanistic and\ncomputational framework for understanding how DA shapes motivation and learning across timescales. The\ninsights gained from these experiments will inform targeted interventions for circuit-specific vulnerabilities in\naddiction, depression, and psychosis.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCells are collectively oriented along tissue axes to execute coordinated behaviors during embryonic\ndevelopment. The highly conserved Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway allows cells to communicate directional\ninformation with each other to direct essential processes such as neural tube closure, axis elongation, and\nheart morphogenesis. The core PCP pathway includes three transmembrane proteins (Celsr1, Fzd6, and\nVangl2), which form complexes on opposite sides of the cell. Through interactions with intracellular binding\npartners, these proteins are able to self-organize such that Vangl2/Celsr1 complexes enrich on one side while\nFzd6/Celsr1 complexes enrich on the other side of the cell. Extracellularly, Vangl2/Celsr1 complexes form an\nasymmetric junction with Fzd6/Celsr1 complexes to directly link PCP asymmetry between neighboring cells. A\ndefining characteristic of PCP organization is its alignment with a tissue axis which allows cells to uniformly\norient PCP asymmetry across great distances. This stereotypic pattern cannot be achieved by\nself-organization alone as cells could spontaneously organize in any orientation with respect to the tissue axis.\nFor this reason, a well-accepted hypothesis emerged that a \u2018directional cue\u2019 acts in a gradient across a tissue\nto bias the distribution of PCP proteins along the same axis. Currently, the identity of potential \u2018directional cues\u2019\nremain elusive, and how the core PCP pathway interacts with the cue to generate tissue-level asymmetry is\nunknown. Forward genetic screens are a powerful tool to identify genes involved in a particular process based\non the phenotype. In fact, core PCP genes were identified in Drosophila based on disrupted bristle orientations\nin the wing and thorax of PCP mutants. However, the same approach is less successful in identifying genes\nthat encode \u2018directional cues\u2019 as they are also thought to be essential for the development of the tissue itself.\nFortunately, breeders have performed their own forward genetic screen in guinea pigs and mice, selecting for\nnaturally occurring genetic variants with altered hair follicle orientation. Similar to Drosophila bristles,\nmammalian hair follicles are oriented by the PCP pathway. The altered fur orientation in these natural variants\nshows that planar polarity alignment is decoupled from the body axis in a region-specific and uniform manner,\nsuggesting the causative mutations alter \u2018directional cues.\u2019 Remarkably, the viability of the animals and the\noverall architecture of the skin itself remain unaltered. By turning to these natural variants, I hypothesize that I\nwill be able to identify \u2018directional cues\u2019 that link PCP asymmetry to a tissue axis. By computationally mapping\nthe genetic variants, I will reveal genes required to link PCP alignment to a tissue axis. Through phenotypic\ncharacterization in vivo and in vitro, I will define how the altered gene impacts PCP asymmetry at individual\njunctions and its alignment across the entire tissue. This research will uncover mechanisms coordinating cell\nbehaviors across tissues, lending insight into a fundamental process that is required for proper development.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nHow does mutant ATXN1 expression in microglia impact Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 pathogenesis?\nSpinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a fatal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease without a cure\nor effective therapies to delay disease onset and progression. SCA1 is caused by a CAG repeat expansion that\nencodes for a polyglutamine stretch in the ATAXIN-1(ATXN1) protein and is characterized by deficits in motor\ncoordination, dysarthria, and premature death. Prior work has uncovered increased numbers of microglia,\nmicroglia contribution to SCA1 motor phenotypes, and differentially expressed genes in SCA1 microglia.\nHowever, there is still a critical need to understand whether these phenotypes are due to mutant ATXN1\n(mATXN1) expression in microglia or surrounding cells. The goal of my proposal is to determine the role\nmicroglial mATXN1 expression plays in motor behavior, microglia molecular phenotypes, and the impact on\nsurrounding cells. I aim to achieve this by removing mATXN1 from microglia by crossing Lyve1CRE mice with f-\nATXN1146Q/2Q mice. The f-ATXN1146Q/2Q mouse model contains LoxN sites around mATXN1 allowing for\nconditional deletion of mATXN1 with Cre recombinase expression. The Lyve1CRE model highly expresses Cre\nrecombinase in microglia and macrophages. Crossing these two mice will generate f-ATXN1146Q/2Q;Lyve1CRE\nmice which will have mATXN1 deleted from microglia and macrophages. I aim to assess the impact of removing\nmATXN1 expression in microglia on motor deficits, microglia disease phenotypes, and cerebellar pathogenesis.\nMotor function will be assessed through battery of motor assay. Microglia disease phenotypes and cerebellar\npathogenesis will be assessed with a combination of single nuclei and bulk RNA sequencing and\nimmunohistochemistry. I hypothesize that removal of mATXN1 will ameliorate motor deficits, correct the number\nof differentially expressed genes in microglia and other cerebellar cells, and ameliorate microglial reactivity and\ncerebellar pathology seen through immunohistochemistry. This research will aid in further elucidating the role\nmicroglia plays in SCA1, a relatively understudied aspect of SCA1. Finally, the training I will receive during this\nwork is paramount to my goal to become faculty at research university.",

Within this five-year program, we will focus on the\nconcept of interdisciplinary musculoskeletal research. Specifically, the proposed training program will provide\nintegrated training for five predoctoral students in our three thematic areas: 1) MSK Development and Aging;\n2) MSK Imaging and Translational Studies; and 3) MSK Cancers and Osteoimmunology. Our selected faculty\nwithin these themes align with the central concept of interdisciplinary research and have a strong track-record of\nmentoring predoctoral students. Our selected faculty within these themes align with the central concept of\ninterdisciplinary science and have a strong record of accomplishment of mentoring predoctoral students and\ncross-disciplinary collaboration. Faculty within the MSK Development and Aging theme focus on understanding\nhow mechanisms governing correct formation of MSK tissues and how these processes go astray with age. Early\ndetection of MSK conditions aids in the management of MSK conditions, which is the focus of faculty within the\nMSK Imaging and Translational Studies theme. Lastly, faculty within the MSK Cancer and Osteoimmunology\ntheme aim to identify potential treatments for MSK cancers and explore how MSK tissues, including cancers,\ninterface with the immune system. Along with these topical foci, our training program incorporates methods to\nachieve specific training goals, including: 1) exposing trainees to broad MSK research topics and methods\nthat address MSK conditions; 2) supplying training on ethics and reproducibility within research; 3) delivering\nskills needed to develop independent lines of research; and 4) providing networking and career development\nopportunities. This training program will ensure that trainees from diverse backgrounds will be in the best\npossible position to contribute effectively to advancing MSK science.",

    "abstract_text": "Most phenotypic traits, including nearly all morphological, physiological, and molecular quantities, vary\ncontinuously among individuals in a population. These traits are shaped by DNA variation at dozens to\nthousands of genes, giving them a complex, multigenic basis. Over the past 20 years, there has been\nremarkable progress in identifying genomic regions that are associated with complex traits. However, few\nof the causal genes that shape complex traits have been identified. This proposal addresses this key\nproblem by introducing a new method for genetic mapping called CRI-SPA-Map. Our objectives are to\napply CRI-SPA-Map in three distinct, complementary contexts in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: a\npair of closely related strains, a pair of more distantly related strains, and between S. cerevisiae and its\nreproductively isolated sister species S. paradoxus. In each of these contexts, we will identify and analyze\ncausal genes that shape the ability of yeast strains to grow in a set of diverse environmental conditions.\nCRI-SPA-Map makes it possible to transfer small tracts of DNA from one yeast strain to a genetically\ndifferent strain efficiently, in high throughput, and with minimal cost. Combined with high-throughput\nphenotyping, CRI-SPA-Map enables systematic discovery of causal genes that shape complex traits. We\nanticipate that our proposed activities will result in discovery of dozens to hundreds of causal genes.\nSystematic analyses of these genes will provide new insights into the genetic architecture of complex\nmultigenic traits, such as the precise number and effects of causal genes, how their functional roles relate\nto the given trait, and how their effects vary across conditions. This proposal will also generate a\ncommunity resource of libraries of allele-engineered and whole-genome sequenced yeast strains, allowing\nmapping of any trait of interest to gene-level resolution.\nWe will pursue two specific activities in support of the broader impacts of this proposal. In support of improved\nSTEM education, this grant will support a teaching experiment to test if the order in which genetic concepts\nare taught can improve student understanding of multigenic traits. In support of the development of a\ncompetitive STEM workforce, this proposal will establish a new pathway for undergraduate research\nexperiences in complex trait genetics.\nRELEVANCE (See instructions):\nMost phenotypic traits are shaped by DNA variation at dozens to thousands of genes, but few of the causal\ngenes have been identified. This proposal addresses this key problem by introducing a new method for\ngenetic mapping, which we will apply to reveal causal genes in three contexts in the yeast Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae. Systematic analyses of these genes will provide new insights into the genetic architecture of\ncomplex multigenic traits.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary / Abstract\nGenetic variation among individuals shapes important phenotypes, including the risk for common human\ndiseases such as cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurological disease. In particular, regulatory genetic\nvariation causes inter-individual differences in gene expression. The resulting gene expression differences\naccount for a substantial portion of variation in many genetically complex traits.\nIn spite of the critical importance of regulatory variation, many fundamental questions remain open. First,\nmost DNA differences in a given genome likely have no effect. The nature of the specific variants that do\nhave effects remains poorly understood. Second, genetic variation can specifically affect the protein\nabundance of a given gene without altering the abundance of the mRNA of the same gene. The\nmechanisms that are responsible for these protein-specific effects remain unclear. Third, we only have a\ncrude understanding of how the differences in gene expression that result from regulatory variation affect\norganismal phenotypes.\nOver the next five years, research in my laboratory will focus on addressing these critical gaps in\nknowledge. Specifically, we seek to identify and characterize causal DNA variants, study the impact of\ngenetic variation on protein degradation, and examine quantitatively how the precise abundance of a given\ngene can shape organismal traits. Our work combines computational biology, quantitative and statistical\ngenetics with experimental genome-wide approaches. We use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a\npowerful and tractable model system for regulatory variation, while pursuing related approaches in human\ncells.\nOur long-term vision is to improve our understanding of regulatory variation to the point at which it becomes\npossible to accurately predict the consequences of the DNA variants in an individual\u2019s genome. This ability\nwill be valuable for fundamental research and personalized approaches for improving human health.",

Although CT is expected to remain the gold standard for\npatient monitoring, these issues make it attractive to explore an alternative monitoring modality that could be\ndone more often, possibly even at home, and could be used to screen whether the full CT is necessary. Such a\ntool would not only help reduce the number of CT scans needed for stable patients, it would also have the\npotential to be used more often than the usual 6-12 month frequency of surveillance CT, meaning that a potential\nproblem could identified sooner.\nIn this exploratory project, we will determine whether carotid pulse arrival time (cPAT) has the potential to be\nsuch a monitoring tool. cPAT is easily measured via surface tonometry, and electrical-impedance-based\nmethods are even simpler and less costly. cPAT is also a direct measurement of flow through the ascending\nthoracic aorta, unlike the standard pulse wave velocity measurements that test wave speed between, e.g., the\ncarotid and femoral arteries.\nThe appeal of cPAT is clear, but it is not clear that the measurement is sensitive enough to measure significant\nchanges in the ascending aorta. Thus, we will use two Specific Aims to assess the potential of cPAT as a\nmonitoring tool. First, we will perform an experiment on a large cross-sectional cohort to determine whether cPAT\nresults are consistent with the empirical expected pulse wave velocity based on age and blood pressure, testing\nwhether cPAT can measure a population-level trend that one would expect to see. Second, we will perform\ncomputer simulations of fluid-structure interaction flow in the ascending aorta, using realistic geometries based\non patient scans. These simulations, which will include longitudinal patient scans and artificially enlarged\naneurysms, will allow us to assess how much of a change in vessel properties could be detected given the time\nresolution of the cPAT. Together, these two Aims will determine whether a larger-scale study is merited on\nwhether cPAT can be an effective monitoring tool.",

This orally transmitted virus is associated\nwith a spectrum of diseases, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a type of head and neck cancer, oral hairy\nleukoplakia, infectious mononucleosis, and certain B cell malignancies, and about 10% of gastric cancers.\nDespite its substantial health impact, there are currently no commercial vaccines or targeted therapies for EBV\ninfection or EBV-associated diseases, and the mechanisms underlying EBV's diverse pathogenic effects remain\nlargely elusive.\nA critical aspect of EBV's oncogenic potential lies in its ability to transform primary B cells into immortalized\nlymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), a process central to EBV-associated tumorigenesis. EBNA2, an EBV encoded\nnuclear antigen, plays a pivotal role in this transformation by acting as a master regulator of both viral and host\ngene expression. EBNA2's pathogenesis is intrinsically linked to its transcriptional regulation activity. This protein\nregulates the expression of hundreds of viral and host genes. However, the mechanisms through which\nEBNA2 regulates gene expression remain elusive. In this proposal, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms by\nwhich EBNA2 regulates gene expression and its contribution to B cell transformation and EBV pathogenesis.\nWe will investigate this from three key aspects: (1) Identification of EBNA2 co-factors involved in EBNA2-\nmediated transcriptional regulation. EBNA2 regulates gene expression through largely unidentified co-factors.\nDissecting these crucial co-factors will not only enhance our understanding of EBNA2's regulatory mechanisms\nbut also identify potential targets for treating EBV-associated diseases. (2) Determine the mechanism through\nwhich EBNA2 regulates genome organization and its impact on B cell transformation and gene expression. Our\npreliminary data indicate that EBNA2 globally alters host genome structure. Given the critical role of genome\nstructure in gene transcription regulation, we hypothesize that EBNA2 manipulates genome organization to\nregulate gene expression. We will investigate the mechanisms through which EBNA2 regulates genome\norganization and its effect on gene expression and B cell transformation. (3) Single-cell analysis of EBNA2 in\ntranscriptional regulation. LCLs are heterogeneous cell populations. Consequently, studying the EBNA2\nregulome using bulk RNA-seq from LCLs may obscure crucial information about differential responses to EBNA2\namong distinct cell subpopulations. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of EBNA2's impact on\ntranscriptional regulation across diverse cell populations in LCLs and during EBV-mediated B cell transformation,\nwe will employ single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq techniques.\nIn summary, this proposal will comprehensively evaluate the role of EBNA2 in transcriptional regulation. This\nresearch addresses critical knowledge gaps in EBV biology, potentially leading to new targeted therapies and\npreventive strategies against EBV-associated malignancies.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract:\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated diseases remain a huge burden in human health. As an\norally transmitted pathogen, EBV infection causes infectious mononucleosis and ~200,000\ncases of various cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma that occurs in a space\nimmediately adjacent to the oral cavity, some B cell malignancies, and ~10% of gastric cancer.\nIn HIV infected people, EBV causes oral hairy leukoplakia of tongue. To understand the\nmolecular mechanisms through which EBV contributes to disease development,\nEBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines are used as a model system. EBV nuclear antigen\nleader protein (EBNALP) is essential for EBV to transform na\u00efve B lymphocytes. Most of its\nknown functions are linked to EBV transcription activator EBNA2. However, EBNALP binds to\nmany enhancer and promoter sites independent of EBNA2. Perturbations of these EBNALP\nsites with CRISPRi significantly decreased these enhancers\u2019 linked gene expression. Little is\nknown about how EBNALP exerts its EBNA2 independent functions. It is also not known how\nEBNALP is tethered to the enhancer/promoter sites and how they affect transcription.\nTherefore, we hypothesize that EBNALP exploits host transcription programs to gain\naccess to host enhancers/promoters, and contributes to EBV transformation through\nEBNA2-independent mechanisms. During my mentored period, I will address the\nfundamental question of how EBNALP binds to DNA. We will use CRISPR-based assays to\nidentify host proteins essential for EBNALP enhancer activation. I will first focus on\nsequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). Chromatin immune precipitation (ChIP) based\nassays will be used to test the effects of knockout on EBNALP DNA binding. During my R00\nphase, I will perform research independently and distinguish my work from my mentor\u2019s by\nstudying different aspects of EBNALP. I will focus my studies on characterizing the enhancer\nprotein complexes assembled by EBNALP onto the enhancers to regulate transcription\nactivity. I will focus on transcription cofactors, basal transcription factors, and histone\nmodifying enzymes. Understanding the mechanisms through which EBNALP binds to DNA\nand regulates gene transcription may provide promising targets for treating EBV-associated\ndiseases.",

    "abstract_text": "Persistent differences in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival across population subgroups cannot be explained fully by traditional risk factors. These differences are seen for all cancers combined, most common cancers, frailty, morbidity, and mortality among cancer survivors. Complex interactions of biologic, psychosocial, socioeconomic, and environmental factors contribute to these differences. This project, responsive to PAR-23-255, will use data from two well-characterized prospective studies, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), to investigate contributions of person-level and neighborhood-level social and structural determinants of health (SSDOH) to accelerated biological aging, cancer risk, and differences in frailty and mortality among cancer survivors. We will examine independent and joint contributions of education, economic stability, social isolation and support, neighborhood demographics and area deprivation ascertained at the census tract level, to study outcomes. This proposed study builds on our existing work (R01CA267977) that has used published and novel proteomic aging clocks (PACs) to quantify biologic aging and link PAC acceleration to total cancer risk, risk of smoking-related cancers, and frailty and mortality in cancer survivors in ARIC and MESA. With this R21, we seek to better understand the SSDOH drivers of age acceleration and their contribution to cancer risk and survivorship. By examining person-level and neighborhood-level SSDOH measures, we aim to address the complexity of variations in cancer incidence and survivorship. We have SSDOH, proteomic and cancer data on >10,800 ARIC participants with nearly 4,100 incident cancer cases over 30 years of follow-up, and >5,300 MESA participants with nearly 700 incident cancer cases over 18 years of follow-up. Our central hypothesis is that SSDOH become biologically embodied via PAC acceleration leading to disparities in cancer risk and survivorship outcomes. Specific Aims are: 1) Identify associations of person-level and neighborhood-level SSDOH with PAC acceleration and incident cancer in two prospective cohorts of adults. 2) Determine associations of both person-level and neighborhood-level SSDOH with PAC acceleration, frailty, and all-cause mortality among cancer survivors in ARIC and MESA. Our proposed analyses will be completed in the total population of ARIC and MESA (separately) and then stratified by population subgroups; subsequently we will complete meta-analyses combining ARIC and MESA data. Our multi-disciplinary study team is well-prepared to lead this work, with complementary expertise in research on population health differences, SSDOH and chronic disease risk, molecular and cancer epidemiology, oncology and cancer survivorship, aging biomarkers, biostatistics, and proteomics analyses. The proposed study will have a significant impact by advancing the understanding of how socio-environmental factors translate into biological age acceleration, measured by PACs, and lead to greater cancer risk and adverse outcomes among cancer survivors.",

In 2021, we added an early-stage investigators (ESI) program to the ABMR\nannual meeting, specifically to foster career development and leadership skills of promising behavioral\nmedicine scholars with their first K- or R-level award from NIH. This R13 conference grant will support the\nplanned 2024 and 2025 annual scientific meetings, including participation of 6 invited Keynote Speakers (3 per\nyear) and our ESI Program (10 per year). The 2024 meeting will be held June 20-23, 2024, at The Depot in\nMinneapolis, MN and the 2025 meeting will be held June 25-28, 2025 in Portland, ME. Our R13 has 3 Aims. In\nAim 1, we seek to promote interdisciplinary discourse on the latest advances in behavioral medicine, public\nhealth and health policy to promote healthy aging and reduce chronic disease disparities. Within this overall\ntheme, the 2024 meeting will focus on strengthening the impact of our science by enhancing collaborations\namong scientists, discussing cutting-edge and integrative team science approaches to research. The 2025\nfocus will be on strengthening the impact of the science by enhancing collaborations outside our traditional\nacademic boundaries, discussing innovative partnerships and the critical value of two-way communications\nwith local communities, healthcare systems, and policymakers. Both meetings will include Keynotes, symposia,\nroundtable discussions, working groups, and ample time for networking. In Aims 2 and 3, we will support\ndiverse and up-and-coming ESIs through the ABMR ESI Fellowship Award, providing a leadership workshop,\nmentorship and career development training focused on strategies for sustaining and strengthening\nindependence and leadership. This R13 enables ABMR to nurture the success of the next generation of\nbehavioral medicine researchers and leaders, which aligns with NIH\u2019s Next Generation Researchers Initiative,\nand enables ABMR to advance the field of behavioral medicine as it has since its inception 45 years ago.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY \u2013 Investigator Development Core\nThere is a critical need to support early-stage investigators (ESIs) researching solutions to well-documented\ndisparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related chronic conditions (RCC) that disproportionately\nburden communities identified as Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC). This work requires direct\nparticipation from the groups most affected, who are traditionally underrepresented in science and medicine\n(URSM); unfortunately, URSM investigators often lack institutional resources and structural supports that are\ncritical for success. To address these needs, the Investigator Development (ID) Core of the proposed P50\nCenter for Chronic Disease Reduction and Equity promotion Across Minnesota (C2DREAM) has two primary\ngoals: (1) Administer a pilot grant program that supports and empowers awardees to conduct high-impact\nresearch on CVD and RCC among BIPOC communities across Minnesota. (2) Prepare the next generation of\ninvestigators to conduct multi-level, multi-disciplinary interventional research to address racism and other\nsocial and structural determinants of CVD and RCC disparities. Both goals are undergirded by a focus on\nincreasing the diversity of the scientific workforce. We have 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1: Facilitate the development\nand successful conduct of innovative pilot projects (minimum of 30 projects over 5 years) led by a diverse\ngroup of ESIs aimed at addressing CVD and RCC disparities in Minnesota\u2019s BIPOC communities. Projects will\ntarget one or more of C2DREAM\u2019s priority health disparities populations in Minnesota and CVD or RCC\ndisparities, be aligned with the C2DREAM conceptual framework, use a multi-level, multi-domain approach\nconsistent with the NIMHD framework, and include a mentoring plan for the ESI and a plan for community\nengagement. Aim 2: Design and launch a robust series of workshops, seminars, networking opportunities and\nresearch resources, called Support and TrAining for Research Success (STARS), to promote preparation,\nproductivity, and advancement of ESIs. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the ID Core on success of pilot\nprojects and career development of ESIs. We propose innovative, multifaceted approaches to accomplish our\nAims. The pilot grant program includes a training option (Pilot Incubator Intensive series) to improve unfunded\napplications and keep promising investigators in the pipeline. We have engaged >130 faculty from across our\npartnering institutions to serve as faculty affiliates for the Center who are committed to serving as mentors and\npilot application reviewers. We will conduct participatory workshops and intensive one-on-one coaching with\nESIs as they develop peer-reviewed manuscripts and future grant proposals, provide networking opportunities\nand a suite of resources to support ESIs. The ID Core will have impact by creating a rigorous infrastructure\ndesigned to promote success of ESIs (including postdoctoral fellows, ESIs and community researchers from\nother C2DREAM-aligned programs across the region) and improve recruitment and retention of URSM\ninvestigators in the scientific workforce addressing chronic disease disparities.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nRaised intracranial pressure (ICP) is a common complication of cryptococcal meningitis (CM), affecting around\nhalf of patients, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Lumbar punctures (LP) are used to diagnose\nraised ICP, by measuring cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure (OP), and to treat raised ICP by\ntherapeutic drainage of CSF. This reduces mortality but relief is often only temporary and high ICP frequently\nrecurs during treatment, requiring further repeat LPs, sometimes daily. LPs are invasive, often painful\nprocedures, and can lead to complications. A non-invasive test to identify patients with raised ICP would be\nhighly advantageous as it would help identify patients at risk of ICP-associated complications, and significantly\nreduce the number of LPs performed purely for ICP monitoring reasons.\nRetinal imaging technologies show great promise and are now routinely used to detect and monitor raised ICP\nin other neurological conditions. These include Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), which uses safe low-\npower laser to produce high-resolution, cross-sectional images of the retina, allowing for very accurate\nmeasurement of optic nerve swelling - a strong predictor of raised ICP; and fundoscopy, to identify retinal\nvessel changes associated with raised ICP. With the development of low-cost, portable OCT machines and\nlens adaptations that enable the use of mobile platforms for high-quality non-mydriatic fundoscopy, these\nassessments are now much more accessible to non-ophthalmologists and in resource limited settings.\nIn this proof-of-concept translational proposal, we will evaluate whether mobile OCT and smartphone\nfundoscopy can be used to identify high ICP in CM patients at diagnosis and during treatment, and which non-\ninvasive retinal imaging modality is better. To do this we will conduct a prospective cohort study in Kampala,\nUganda, enrolling patients with HIV-associated CM. We will perform serial OCT and smartphone fundoscopy\nduring inpatient treatment and compare these readings to opening pressure measured at LP. The proposal\ndraws together expertise in retinal imaging and OCT analysis from Dr. Mollan\u2019s group in Birmingham, with the\nclinical experience of a long-established and highly productive meningitis research collaboration between the\nUniversity of Minnesota and the Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University (Uganda).\nThis project has the potential to significantly impact the complex clinical care required to treat persons with\nHIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, particularly in resource-limited settings. Using mobile retinal imaging\nas a non-invasive test for raised ICP would reduce the material resources, technical manpower, and possibility\nof adverse events that are associated with performing LPs. By demonstrating proof-of-principle and technical\nfeasibility, the data from this R21 could then be leveraged into a larger diagnostic package of care used in a\nR01-funded randomized control trial for novel treatments and management strategies to reduce ICP in CM.",

My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in conducting clinical\ntrials with nested translational immunology research to further the management of AIDS-related opportunistic\ninfections of the central nervous system. I am particularly interested in developing the skillset, competence,\nand cultural rapport to conduct ethically-sound trials in resource-limited settings in Africa, where the burden of\nHIV/AIDS-related CNS infections disproportionately impacts the population.\n Training: This K23 award will provide the mentoring, didactics, and hands-on training to establish an\nindependent research career. With the mentorship of an interdisciplinary team with expertise in international\nclinical trials and immunology involving HIV-related opportunistic neuroinfections, I will: 1) Improve my\nknowledge of biostatistical design and analysis, 2) Acquire experience on human immunology principles and\ndata interpretation to facilitate effective translational research collaborations, and 3) Gain robust education and\nmentorship in clinical trial design and execution, particularly as it pertains to infectious diseases in Africa.\n Research: CMV viremia is independently associated with mortality in persons with advanced HIV disease;\nhowever, no recommendations exist for the treatment or prevention of CMV viremia alone. My published data\ndemonstrated CMV viremia increased the mortality hazard by 3-fold in a cohort with first-episode cryptococcal\nmeningitis. I hypothesize that CMV viremia exerts a mortality risk that is (1) time-dependent, and (2) associated\nwith impairment of the host Th1 immune response (e.g. interferon-gamma [IFN-\uf067] response). My K23 objective\nis to build the skills and preliminary data necessary to design a future randomized clinical trial to test if anti-\nCMV therapy might mitigate excess mortality. My K23 Specific Aims are:\n 1) Determine if CMV viremia is a time-dependent risk factor for 18-week mortality among Ugandans with\n advanced HIV disease and concomitant cryptococcal meningitis; and\n 2) Determine if host Th1 responses are impaired in persons with active CMV viremia compared to CMV non-\n viremic persons among those with HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis.\n Deliverables: This study will provide key missing clinical trial design parameters, such as the optimal duration\nof an anti-CMV intervention (i.e. informed by CMV viremia duration/persistence and time-dependent mortality\nrisk) and the appropriate risk criteria for enrollment (i.e. any baseline CMV viremia vs CD4-predicted\ncumulative exposure). Further, identifying a plausible immune mechanism (e.g. impaired Th1 responses)\nopens the door for improved risk stratification and for future targeted immunomodulatory clinical trials (e.g.\nsubcutaneous IFN-\uf067). A future randomized trial best determines if CMV viremia is a cause of excess mortality.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nSomatic mosaicism arising from the accumulation of postzygotic DNA mutations in somatic cells (somatic\nmutations), leads to tissue genetic heterogeneity. Somatic mutations occur at different life stages and throughout\nan individual\u2019s lifespan and are implicated in various human diseases, including cancers, monogenic diseases,\nneurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, skin diseases, and liver diseases.\nIn addition, random somatic mutations were identified to accumulate with age in humans, and associated with\nenvironmental and genetic risk factors, for example, tobacco smoking, UV radiation and BRCA1/2 deficiency.\nHowever, it is still unclear whether somatic mutations are a cause of functional decline in human health, for\ninstance, aging, although the hypothesis was proposed in the 1950s, due to several critical knowledge gaps and\nimportant challenges. Due to cell-to-cell heterogeneity, somatic mutations are unique in each cell of normal\ntissues and are extremely difficult to detect accurately, which leads to the large unknown about somatic mutation\nburdens per cell with respect to tissue types and life span in normal, non-cancer tissues of an organism. In\naddition, the causes of somatic mutations and how they evolve in normal tissues during different life stages\nremain unclear. With the experience and expertise in somatic mutations and genome instability, our goals for the\nnext five years is to utilize cutting-edge DNA sequencing technologies, including single-cell whole-genome\nsequencing, Nanorate sequencing, and ultra-deep bulk whole-genome sequencing and computational analyses\nto 1) quantitatively explore somatic mutation burdens in normal, non-cancerous tissues in mice across different\nlife stages; 2) identify mutational signatures and clusters, to infer molecular mechanisms and risk factors and to\nguide experimental validation in the future; 3) decipher the patterns of somatic mutation evolution, examining\nwhether they are subject to random drift, positive selection or negative selection across tissue types and life\nstages. Based on the new discoveries, for the long-term goals, I will explore the health relevance of mutation\nburden, signature, and somatic evolution, quantify the risks of environmental factors, and develop new standards\nfor drug safety. Additionally, I plan to select specific genes or genetic regions (with either higher or lower mutation\nburdens than expected) for testing their health relevance. These goals will be achieved using mouse as the\nmodel organism for testing and developing new interventions. Overall, the proposed projects will provide\ncomprehensive insights into somatic mosaicism, laying the groundwork for understanding its role and the\nmechanisms of its impact on biology and health and shedding light on future interventions.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nA remarkable change in the approach to the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of congenital\ncytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection has occurred in recent years. Driven by the advent of universal newborn\nscreening for cCMV, newborns with this infection that would have never been clinically recognized in past years\nare now being identified, evaluated, and monitored \u2013 primarily for delayed-onset sensorineural hearing loss\n(SNHL). SNHL is the major known complication of cCMV, occurring in up to 12% of infants with this infection.\nHowever, the advent of universal screening has created challenges, and exposed significant knowledge deficits\nabout the natural history of cCMV. Conventional thinking has been that the majority of cCMV infections are\nasymptomatic (AcCMV), and except for those children that develop SNHL, the prognosis for a normal outcome\nis favorable. This assumption is based on small, often uncontrolled studies. The long-term neurodevelopmental\nand neurocognitive outcomes of AcCMV have never been examined in a well-powered and unselected\npopulation of infants diagnosed in the context of universal screening. To address these knowledge deficits, and\nbetter understand the potential range of outcomes in AcCMV, this proposal aims to address three specific aims.\nFirst, we aim to determine if infants with AcCMV have reduced white matter structural coherence when compared\nto control infants. Our control infants will come from the NIH-funded HEALthy Brain and Child Development\n(HBCD) Study, which is advancing the field of cognitive neuroimaging by developing and validating significantly\nfaster and higher resolution acquisition protocols, resulting in more robust infant imaging data. Second, we will\ndetermine if infants with AcCMV have reduced performance on longitudinal neurocognitive assessments when\ncompared to HBCD control infants. Key features will be standardized scores of cognitive, language, and motor\nskills, as well as executive function and emotion regulation skills. Third, we aim to explore new scientific avenues\nby determining if AcCMV-associated SNHL can be predicted with brain MRI. Multi-shell diffusion imaging data\nwill measure axonal microarchitecture and fMRI passive listening tasks will measure task-specific BOLD\nresponses. This aim addresses a major challenge in the field of cCMV, and the public health and clinical\nmanagement implications are extensive. Our over-arching hypothesis is that infants with AcCMV do, indeed,\nhave a long-term phenotype that has heretofore been unrecognized because of the limited sensitivity of previous\napproaches. This work will inform and direct the future of newborn cCMV screening programs, and has\nimplications for clinical management, including antiviral therapy. The proposed project will also enhance our\nunderstanding of this ubiquitous but understudied congenital viral infection.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCaregiver Speech and Brain-Behavior Development in Infants At-Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorder\nThe defining symptoms of autism spectrum disorder emerge only after an initial presymptomatic period during\nthe first year of life. The first year of life is also a time of tremendous growth and neuroplasticity for the infant\nbrain. The overall goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to enable and inform presymptomatic infant\ninterventions for autism by examining the relationships between infant vocalizations, caregiver speech, and\nbrain-behavior development in infants at high familial risk for autism. Conceptually, the project focuses on the\npotential protective effects of caregiver speech on infant development. The proposed study is a companion to\nand collaboration with the IBIS Network-Early Prediction Study, an NIH-sponsored study of 250 infants at high\nfamilial risk for autism. All infants in the study have an older sibling with autism. These high-risk infants have a\n20% probability of developing autism themselves.\nEcologically valid day-long home language recordings will be collected when infants are 6 and 12 months of age.\nA state-of-the-art automated processing pipeline will used to estimate daily counts of infant and caregiver speech\nquality and quantity. Micro-level targeted annotation will be applied to semi-structured, parent-infant play\nsessions collected in the lab. Automated processing pipelines and micro-level targeted annotation will be used\nto generate multivariate infant vocalizations and caregiver speech data. Infant vocalizations will be classified as\nspeech-like or non-speech-like (delight or distress). Caregiver speech variables include lexical diversity, mean\nlength utterance, and temporal contingency.\nThe study will determine if infant vocalizations predict subsequent autism diagnosis and later language and\nsocial communication scores, and specify the relationship between caregiver speech and infant communication\nskills. Diffusion MRI will be collected when infants are 6, 12, and 24 months of age by the Early Prediction Study.\nThe proposed study will determine if multivariate caregiver speech is related to targeted prefrontal and temporal\nbrain regions. By determining if caregiver speech can have a protective effect on brain development, we forge a\nnew scientific approach to studying communication development in infants at high-risk for autism.\nAs first-year autism detection and presymptomatic intervention become increasingly feasible, an evidence base\nis needed to inform interventions. The proposed study will identify infant-based language and communication\nrisk markers, caregiver-based intervention targets, and brain-based monitoring biomarkers to guide\npresymptomatic intervention for autism that is parent-mediated and delivered in the natural setting.",

However,\ndespite the clear importance of lateral interactions in a wide range of network models, we lack a clear\nunderstanding of their organization in vivo. To address this challenge, we propose a tight integration\nbetween computational modeling and optogenetic experiments at mesoscopic and cellular scales. We\nfocus on a broad class of models explaining the emergence of highly organized modular patterns through\nstructured local lateral interactions that exhibit local excitation\u2014lateral inhibition (LELI) structure. The\nbehavior of networks governed by such interactions depends critically on the spatial extent, heterogeneity,\nand net strength of these interactions, yet these essential parameters have not yet been examined in vivo.\nHere, we propose to directly probe local lateral interactions of cortical circuits, determine how these circuits\ntransform local and large-scale inputs into output activity patterns, and develop computational models\ndescribing this transform to estimate these essential parameters of network interactions. By mapping\nfunctional interactions at mesoscopic and cellular resolution in vivo in a species with modular organization\nsimilar to that seen in humans, we will be able to provide the clearest evidence to date regarding the LELI-\nstructure of lateral interactions. By applying specifically designed mesoscopic optogenetic stimuli in\nconjunction with widefield calcium imaging, we will map the transformation of input within the cortical\nnetwork on millimeter scales, and shed light on the underlying lateral interactions. Further, by applying this\nframework to a brain area beyond visual cortex, our work has the potential to identify universal principles\ngoverning cortical development and function. The new insights from this proposed work will have broad\nimplications, and will contribute to a deeper understanding of the circuit mechanisms responsible for the\ngeneration of cortical network activity states, providing fundamental knowledge that could serve as the\nbasis for the development of next generation prosthetics and novel treatments for a host of neurological\ndisorders.\nRELEVANCE (See instructions):\nThe research in this proposal will provide new insights into how circuits within a nonmurine cortex transform\nincoming information.

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThe remarkable efficiency of human perception derives from the fact that we do not process each stimulus as a\nnovel event. Instead, past experiences and scene context inform internal, working models of the world that\nallow us to generate predictions for our physical environment. A leading theory suggests that perceptual\npredictions are accomplished via flexible normalization: local inhibitory neuronal populations are regulated by\nlong-range connections so that responses are suppressed when they do not provide helpful information about\nobject boundaries. However, the precise neural mechanisms by which the healthy human brain accomplishes\nthis flexible normalization are not known. In order to understand exactly how neural population responses are\nsuppressed or enhanced in response to different scene contexts, we will perform 2-photon imaging in ferret\nprimary visual cortex (V1) to quantify the responses of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations in superficial\nlayers of cortex during several different visual stimulus paradigms. The ferret model is chosen because the\nimaging techniques necessary to quantify inhibitory neuronal responses are not yet well established in primate\nmodels, and while our current knowledge about neural morphology and connections has been derived from\nmouse models, mouse visual cortex lacks the \u201ccolumnar organization\u201d (spatial grouping of neurons with similar\nresponse properties) that is a hallmark of primate visual cortex and is present in ferrets. Thus, the ferret model\nis well-positioned to bridge the gap between mouse models and primate models. First, in order to understand\nneuronal behaviors in the absence of contextual modulation, we will characterize interactions within a single\nhypercolumn to small, simple stimuli (sinusoidally modulated luminance gratings) at a range of orientations and\ncontrasts. We hypothesize that parvalbumin-containing (PV+) inhibitory interneurons will demonstrate the\nsharpest orientation tuning, followed by somatostatin-containing (SOM+) and serotonin-positive (5HTR+)\npopulations. Next. using a Cross Orientation Suppression paradigm, we will test the hypothesis that that SOM+\nresponses track the overall contrast energy in the stimulus, while PV+ populations reflect suppression of\nindividual grating component representations. Additional experiments with naturalistic textures will test whether\nthese behaviors generalize to stimuli with a broad range of contrasts, orientations, and spatial frequencies.\nFinally, we will use classical Orientation-Dependent Surround Suppression and Collinear Facilitation paradigms\nto study how the local inhibitory pool responds to scene context. We hypothesize that the responses of local\n5HTR+ neurons will reflect the surrounding stimuli rather than the center stimuli. Together, these experiments\nwill constrain an open-source computational model articulated at the level of the single neuron that will\nconstrain hypotheses about how human perceptual behaviors are linked to specific neuronal populations; this\nmodel will be valuable for understanding how perceptual aberrations associated with psychosis might be\nmapped to the function of specific neuronal subpopulations.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nSensory perception requires the coordinated activity of tens of thousands of neurons functioning together in\nlarge-scale networks. The capabilities of these networks are defined and constrained by their development, yet\nthe mechanisms underlying their formation remain incompletely understood. In the visual cortex of primates and\ncarnivores, modular networks consisting of nearby neurons sharing coordinated activity and similar tuning\nproperties extend across millimeters of cortical surface. Prior to eye-opening, such large-scale networks are\nalready evident in correlated spontaneous activity, whose structure can predict future visually-evoked responses.\nWe have previously shown that local recurrent mechanisms utilizing local excitation / lateral inhibition (LELI)\ninteractions account for these modular functional networks in the week prior to eye-opening. However, major\ngaps remain in our ability to relate early network structure to mature sensory function. All previous work occurred\nat ages when spontaneous activity is already modular, meaning that its developmental origins remain unclear.\nFurthermore, early modular networks undergo refinement prior to eye-opening, but the role of changes in\nrecurrent interactions versus changes in inputs is unknown. The experiments in this proposal will address these\ngaps, first by imaging spontaneous activity earlier in development than prior work, beginning at an age when\ncortical neurons are still completing their migration. This will allow us to capture the onset of modular activity in\nthe cortex and investigate whether the same mechanisms that underlie modular activity later in development are\nalso involved from the earliest stages. In order to determine if intracortical circuits are responsible for generating\ndominant modes of activity that refine in the week prior to eye-opening and serve as a dynamic scaffold for future\nvisual representations, we will utilize our ability to directly stimulate the cortex with spatially-patterned\noptogenetics. These experiments will allow us to separate the contributions of changes in input from those of\nchanges within recurrent circuits to both the developmental refinement of cortical networks and their potential\nrole as a template for the future structure of visually-evoked representations. Finally, in order to understand\nwhether a modular organization generated through recurrent LELI mechanisms exists elsewhere in visual\ncortices, we will image spontaneous activity in higher visual areas throughout development, and use patterned\noptogenetic stimulation to directly test the role of LELI mechanisms outside V1. Understanding the mechanisms\nthrough which modular network structure first emerges and whether recurrent circuits serve to generate dominant\nmodes of activity that function as templates for sensory representations is critical for understanding how\nfunctional visual circuits are constructed during development. Determining if such mechanisms operate\nthroughout higher visual areas is key for understanding the function organization of these regions. Collectively,\nthe studies in this proposal will provide critical new insights into both the developmental origins of millimeter-\nscale functional networks and their role in shaping future functional organization throughout the visual cortex.",

Meanwhile, immunotherapy targeting the PD-1:PD-L1 pathway is inducing stunning clinical\noutcomes in other advanced malignancies. However, the underlying mechanisms governing immune\nsurveillance and resistance to a robust antitumor T cell response in pancreatic cancer are largely unknown. We\nare poised to identify how to safely promote T cell-mediated destruction of pancreatic cancer through 2 funded\nR01 applications and a collaborative P01 application. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that immune-\nmediated pancreatic cancer eradication requires the following components: 1) a high affinity tumor specific T\ncell, 2) modification of suppressive intratumoral myeloid cells, and 3) overcoming chronic inflammatory and\nimmunosuppressive signaling pathways. Notably our results demonstrate that developing combinatorial\nstrategies to overcome endogenous T cell dysfunction in PDA may not be the same for enhancing cellular\ntherapy using T cell receptor (TCR) engineered based approaches. Thus, the 3 funded projects are based on\nthe development of highly faithful PDA animal models in which an endogenous or TCR engineered T cell\nresponse can be tracked longitudinally over time. The projects are aimed at uncovering novel mechanisms that\ninterfere with the efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapies designed to engage the endogenous immunity\n(project 1) or TCR engineered T cell therapy (project 2 and 3). We will test novel combinatorial approaches to\nsafely enhance the antitumor activity of a combination therapy that uses CD40 agonist, anti-PD-L1 (project 1) or\nabrogating TGFb signaling in TCR engineered T cells (Project 2) or the combination of TCR engineered T cell\ntherapy and simultaneous modification of the desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (Project 3). Together the\nstudies will identify characteristics of T cells and the tumor microenvironment that produce durable antitumor\nresponses during immunotherapy.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nUnderstanding how neuronal circuits give rise to behavior requires recording their activity at a high temporal and\nspatial resolution with cell type specificity. This is particularly critical in the case of the cerebellum, which in\naddition to being essential for effective control of movement, has ever emerging roles in cognitive functions and\nneurological disorders. However, such recordings have historically been challenging, due to the complex and\nconserved cytoarchitecture of the cerebellar cortex, and the firing properties of its primary output neurons,\nPurkinje cells, which exhibit two distinct activity modalities: simple spikes and complex spikes. Optical\ninterrogation of Purkinje cell Ca2+ can report complex spike events due to their low frequency (0.5-2Hz), but the\nslow kinetics of Ca2+ indicators make them unviable for resolving simple spikes. Conversely, while microelectrode\narrays offer high temporal resolution, they provide limited spatial information. Here, we propose to leverage\nultrasensitive genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) in order to perform the first optical voltage\nrecordings of Purkinje cell simple and complex spike activity during behavior. Our approach will allow us to\nexamine the encoding properties of Purkinje cell simple and complex spiking modalities during behavior and\ninterrogate their interactions relative to the geometry of their inputs and overarching functional organization. In\nAim 1 of this proposal, we will establish the instrumentation and procedures for ultra-high-speed voltage imaging\nof cerebellar Purkinje cells in awake behaving mice. Using this approach, we will examine spike level dynamics\nof both simple and complex spike firing, computing spatiotemporal correlation and activation patterns of\nneighboring Purkinje cells. We will also interrogate the kinematic encoding properties of these two activity\nmodalities. In Aim 2, we will combine our approach for voltage imaging with simultaneous Calcium imaging of\ndendritic activity, to compare Purkinje cell encoding properties and responses to sensorimotor mismatches,\nwhose processing is considered a hallmark of cerebellar function, with their overarching functional dendritic\norganization. Together, our work will shed new light on the population dynamics of Purkinje cell spiking activity\nand contributions to behavior, as well as provide new potential links between the functional and structural\norganization of the cerebellar cortex.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nEpilepsy, a condition characterized by chronic, spontaneous seizures, is the fourth most common neurological\ndisorder, affecting nearly 1 in 27 individuals in the United States. In addition to the seizures themselves, chronic\nepilepsy is associated with cognitive deficits, structural changes, and devastating negative outcomes. For as\nmany as half of all epilepsy patients, seizures are not controlled with current treatment options. There is an\nurgent need to uncover how chronic epilepsy impacts overall function as well as advance new avenues for\ntherapeutic intervention. Despite not being traditionally associated with epilepsy, the cerebellum is emerging\nas a potentially critical node in the seizure network; cerebellar structural alterations in epilepsy are associated\nwith comorbidities and negative outcomes, and interventions targeting the cerebellum can powerfully attenuate\nhippocampal seizures in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This bi-directional influence of seizures on\nthe cerebellum and vice versa clearly outline the cerebellum area as a potentially key player in epilepsy, whose\nyet unknown exact role carries major implications for patients. This proposal leverages a novel technique for\nmesoscale imaging of the cerebellar cortex to probe how diverse seizure networks alter cerebellar activity, as\nwell as determine whether targeting cerebellar outputs can attenuate seizures arising in structures beyond the\nhippocampus. By uncovering how the cerebellum interacts with different seizure foci, we will not only gain\ncritical insight into the impact of seizures and chronic epilepsy on cerebellar function, but also potentially\nuncover new targets for therapeutic modulation in the treatment of different epilepsies.\nMy overarching research interest is to understand computations performed by the cerebellar cortex and how\nthey contribute to healthy behavior and disease. My career goals include becoming an independent researcher\nstudying cerebellar network dynamics and interactions with forebrain structures during motor and non-motor\nbehavior, as well as epilepsy and seizures. My previous training background has given me a solid foundation\nin electrophysiological recordings, behavioral analyses, optogenetic manipulations, and the implementation of\nrodent models of epilepsy. However, to fully realize my independent research goals, the training outlined in this\nK99 will equip me with new skills in experimental techniques and analysis strategies to characterize cellular\nand network dynamics using calcium imaging. In addition to new technical expertise, this K99 will provide me\nwith a broadened scientific network, improved laboratory management skills, and augmented grant writing\nexpertise. Combined with my prior experience, the additional training and expertise provided by this K99\nprovides key additions that will help me establish a successful, independent laboratory incorporating innovative,\ncutting edge research techniques to explore cerebellar computations and their specific contributions to healthy\nbehavior and disease.",

Differences in lung\nmicroenvironments, including the granuloma, influence the support and suppression of Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis (Mtb). While factors that impact microenvironment specific immune responses and Mtb sterility in\nthe lung are incompletely understood, recent studies have shown that the microbiome takes an active role in\nshaping the immune response. Both lung and gut microbiomes have been shown to influence disease outcome\nin influenza, cystic fibrosis, asthma, cancer, and COPD. The dominant animal model used in TB is the mouse.\nWhile laboratory breeding of mice in specific pathogen free (SPF) and hygienic conditions has increased\nreproducibility, it has also removed much of the microbial exposure experienced by free-living organisms. Daily\nencounters with microbes help sculpt the immune system for a robust response against new pathogens.\nUnfortunately, the immune system of SPF mice lacks effector differentiated CD8+ memory T cells, which are\ncritical cell types for an immediate response to infection. It is unknown how prior experience to microbes\nimpacts TB progression. This proposal leverages a novel mouse model (\u2018dirty\u2019 mouse model) that creates\nmultiple exposures to diverse microbes to shape the immune response in SPF mice. Microbially experienced\npet store mice will be housed with C3HeB/FeJ SPF mice; thereby, transferring both commensal and\npathogenic microbes between animals.

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nMammarenaviruses, or arenaviruses, can cause a range of diseases in humans, including congenital disorders,\nencephalitis, meningitis, and severe hemorrhagic fevers (HFs). Arenaviruses are divided into Old World (OW)\nand New World (NW) groups. Several NW arenaviruses, such as Jun\u00edn (JUNV), Machupo (MACV), Guanarito\n(GTOV), Chapare (CHAPV), and Sabi\u00e1 (SABV), are endemic in South America and can cause HF infections in\nhumans with fatality rates reaching up to 30%. Other uncharacterized or unknown NW arenaviruses may include\npotential pathogens. To date, there are no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for arenaviruses. Candid#1,\na live attenuated JUNV vaccine, is licensed for use in Argentina against JUNV-caused Argentine HF, but is\nunlikely to be approved by the FDA due to safety concerns. There is an urgent need for vaccines to prevent\ncurrent and future arenavirus outbreaks. Our long-term goal is to create safe and effective vaccines against\npathogenic arenaviruses. The objective of this R01 proposal is to leverage the unique properties of a viral\nvaccine vector rP18tri based on a non-pathogenic NW arenavirus, Pichinde virus (PICV), to develop safe and\nbroadly protective vaccines against NW arenaviral pathogens. PICV has no to low seroprevalence in humans,\neven in endemic areas in Colombia, South America. The rP18tri-based live-attenuated vaccines show limited\nreplication in the vaccinated animals, with no evidence of viremia or virus shedding. They induce a balanced\nlevel of antigen-specific antibody and T-cell responses, which can be further enhanced by homologous boosting.\nOur compelling preliminary data demonstrate that the rP18tri-based JUNV vaccines are safe and can provide\ncomplete protection against virulent JUNV challenges in guinea pigs. Furthermore, the rP18tri vector alone can\nconfer partial protection against JUNV, underscoring its potential to elicit broadly protective immunity against\ndiverse NW arenaviruses. We hypothesize that the non-pathogenic arenavirus vector (rP18tri)-based vaccines\nexpressing multivalent antigens from JUNV and MACV will elicit robust and broadly protective immunity against\nvarious NW arenaviruses. We have assembled a multi-institutional team of investigators with complementing\nexpertise in molecular virology, viral vector and vaccine development, guinea pig T cell immunology, and animal\nmodeling of arenavirus HFs in the BSL3/4 facilities. We will produce a panel of rP18tri-based NW arenavirus\nvaccines expressing one or two antigens (glycoprotein GPC and nucleoprotein NP) from JUNV and MACV,\nevaluate their immunogenicity and protective efficacy against homologous (Aim 1) and heterologous (Aim 2)\nvirus challenge in established guinea pig models, and characterize vaccine-induced protective immunity (Aim\n3). Impact: The study will generate safe and broadly protective NW arenaviral vaccine candidates for subsequent\npreclinical and clinical evaluation, generate new knowledge about the protective antigen(s) and immunity to guide\nthe design of next-generation arenavirus vaccines, and advance the rP18tri platform for developing vaccines\nand immune therapies against communicable and noncommunicable diseases, such as cancers, in humans.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nWith advances in modern technologies, an enormous amount of high-throughput neuroimaging and\ngenomics data are available through large-scale public databases such as the Adolescent Brain Cognitive\nDevelopment Study (ABCD) project. These expansive \"big multi-modal data\" repositories have\nspurred the rapid growth of brain imaging genomics studies to improve understanding of the\npathophysiological processes and genetic architecture of mental disorders. However, these large-scale\ndatabases also present significant challenges in data management and analysis, given the common\ncharacteristics of large open data including high dimensionality, data inconsistency, and complex\ncorrelation structures. In addition, a wide gap exists between neuroimaging and statistical genomics\nresearchers, causing extra barriers to reproducible research in brain imaging genomics. While many\ntraining programs provide neuroimaging or genetics data analysis training, very limited (if any) of them\nfocus on studying the relationship between neuroimaging and genomics underlying mental health.\nThis proposal outlines a three-week summer workshop designed to equip graduate-level students or\njunior researchers with knowledge and skills to conduct reproducible analysis of brain imaging\ngenomics. The primary focus will be on learning in best practices how to estimate meaningful\nassociations of genetic variants on brain structure and function, along with their implications for\ncognitive functions and broader mental health outcomes. Our proposed workshop will address the\ncritical need for training on neuroimaging genomics to build a bridge between cognitive neuroscience\nand genomics and promote rigorous and robust analyses of large open brain imaging genomics data\nwith statistical considerations that are specific to large open data . The workshop also aims to promote\ndiversity with trainees having different social and academic backgrounds and prioritizing the attendance\nof underrepresented scholars.\nThe workshop will feature in-person training with an interdisciplinary faculty team comprising experts\nin statistical and machine learning methodology, genomics, and brain imaging research. We expect that\nby end of the workshop the trainees will be able to (1) Learn to access and use large, open brain\nresearch databases and understand analytical and statistical considerations specific to large open data;\n(2) know the important scientific questions in brain research and learn to design and conduct\nneuroimaging-genotype association studies with clinically meaningful phenotypes; and (3) develop best\npractices of coding and documentation for reproducible research of brain imaging genomics. All\nlectures, codes, and lab exercises will be made available on GitHub and the course website, ensuring the\nwidespread dissemination of our training program within the broader community.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nAcute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the most common form of childhood cancer. Despite dramatic\nimprovements in initial remission rates over the past 50 years, relapsed ALL remains a significant challenge\nand is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in children. Thus, ALL continues to pose a substantial\nhealth concern. The BCR-ABL fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation, is a key driver of\nleukemogenesis in ALL and serves as a promising target for immunotherapy due to its tumor-specific and\nessential role in oncogenesis. Studies have indicated that the presence of T cells specific for the BCR-ABL\nfusion epitope correlates with better leukemia control; however, vaccine-based strategies to elicit such\nprotective T cell responses have not been successful. Our lab, together with our collaborator, has previously\ngenerated MHC class II tetramers linked to the BCR-ABL fusion peptide (BAp), which identified a small\npopulation of CD4+ T cells capable of recognizing this leukemia antigen. These BAp CD4+ T cells expanded in\nthe presence of BCR-ABL+ leukemia but were often converted into immunosuppressive FOXP3\u207a regulatory T\ncells (Tregs) or dysfunctional type 1 regulatory (Tr1) like cells producing IL-10, limiting their effectiveness.\nInterestingly, combining tyrosine kinase inhibitors like nilotinib with anti-PD-L1 antibodies promoted Th1 CD4+\nT cell responses and prevented relapse in murine models, suggesting that effective activation of BAp-specific T\ncells can enhance leukemia control. A key question that emerges is how to identify and activate T cells capable\nof sustaining durable anti-leukemia responses without succumbing to exhaustion or immunosuppressive\nconversion. We have collaborated with Dr. Dileepan to develop \"affinity-enhanced\" peptide-MHC class II\ntetramers (BAp) by augmenting the interaction between the MHCII \u03b2 chain and the CD4 co-receptor, allowing\nus to identify and potentially activate these low-affinity T cells. I propose that activating low-affinity BAp-specific\nT cells using these affinity-enhanced reagents can generate potent and sustained anti-leukemia immunity.\nThus, my central hypothesis is that a proper activation of low-affinity BAp CD4+ T cells is crucial for preventing\nrelapse in ALL. This hypothesis will be tested in the following two specific aims: (1) Determine whether\nenhancing low-affinity BCR-ABL-specific T cell responses limits relapse, and (2) Determine the\nrelationship between functional low-affinity BCR-ABL-specific T cells and clinical outcomes in ALL\npatients. Completion of these aims will further advance our understanding of how low-affinity T cells can be\nharnessed to generate durable anti-leukemia responses and how perturbation of these responses can lead to\nrelapse in ALL. This research may lead to new immunotherapeutic strategies that improve survival outcomes\nfor ALL patients and provide insights applicable to other cancers. Finally, this project will provide me with\nimportant training in the use of cutting-edge research tools and models, which are important skills for me to\nacquire as I embark on a career as a physician-scientist focused on cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nOvarian cancer remains the deadliest gynecologic malignancy, with a five-year survival rate below 50% and a\nhigh likelihood of recurrence. Current treatment strategies, centered on surgical debulking and chemotherapy,\nhave shown limited advancements over the past several decades, underscoring the urgent need for novel\ntherapies. Immunotherapy holds immense promise in this context, as increased natural killer (NK) cell activity\nhas been correlated with improved outcomes in ovarian cancer patients. Unlike T cells, NK cells are inherently\nnon-antigen-specific, enabling them to respond to heterogeneous tumors without prior sensitization, while also\navoiding complications like graft-versus-host disease. Like T cells, however, NK cells activity is hindered by the\nimmunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To overcome this, our lab has developed and rigorously tested\nthe Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE) platform, which enhance NK cell activity by simultaneously targeting\nCD16 on NK cells, binding tumor-associated antigens, and delivering an interleukin-15 (IL-15) cytokine\ndomain. Together, the TriKE promotes NK cell migration, activation, proliferation, and sustained cytotoxicity.\nHowever, as with any immunotherapy targeting only a single antigen, the therapeutic application of the TriKE\nmolecules could be hindered by the risk of antigen escape, particularly in ovarian cancer\u2019s highly\nheterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME). To address this challenge, we have developed a dual-antigen\ntargeting NK cell engager platform. A Poly-Antigen Cytokine Complex (PACC), which binds to the TriKE\u2019S\nIL-15 domain, was made by linking IL-15 receptor subunit alpha (IL-15R\u03b1) to a tumor-targeting antibody\ndomain. This innovative system combines the well-established benefits of TriKEs with targeting of a second\ntumor-associated antigen. By simultaneously engaging B7H3 and CD133, the TriKE-PACC is designed to exert\ngreater immunologic pressure, reducing the likelihood of antigen escape and improving therapeutic efficacy.\nAim 1 will evaluate the ability of the TriKE-PACC to prevent antigen escape in vitro and in vivo using ovarian\ncancer cell lines with CRISPR-modulated antigen expression to model antigen escape. Aim 2 will assess the\npreclinical efficacy of the TriKE-PACC against patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of ovarian cancer to\ncapture the full heterogeneity of clinical tumors. Together, these studies will establish the therapeutic potential\nof the TriKE-PACC and provide a foundation for its clinical translation. By targeting a dual-antigen approach to\nenhance NK cell immunotherapy, this project seeks to provide a novel treatment avenue for ovarian cancer\npatients, particularly the unmet need of those with recurrent disease who currently lack effective therapeutic\noptions.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\n CD4 T cells govern host control of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. The diverse phagocytic myeloid cells\nthat harbor intracellular Mtb in the lungs require CD4 T cell help to activate antibacterial effector mechanisms.\nProtection against tuberculosis (TB) depends on this cellular interaction, but it remains incompletely defined.\n In our preliminary studies, we discovered that myeloid cells in the lungs of Mtb infected mice critically\ndepend on T cells to deploy a broad program of transcriptional activity that controls intracellular infection.\nThese pathways, constituting the spectrum of T cell help, included some pathways known to be due to\nadaptive immune function, but also others that are canonically considered innate. Despite the heterogeneity of\nmyeloid cells in the lungs, most T cell dependent pathways were shared by MHCII+ antigen presenting cells\n(APCs) and non-antigen presenting cells, like neutrophils. Using adoptive transfer, we found that CD4 T cells\nwere both necessary and sufficient for induction of the acute inflammatory response by MHCII+ APCs, as\nmarked by expression of SAA3. Concordantly, we found that expression of MHCII by monocyte derived APCs\nwas required for control of Mtb in the lungs. To advance understanding of how cell-cell contact mediated by\nimmune synapse formation between CD4 T cells and Mtb-infected APCs contributes to protection, we\ndeveloped a technique to identify and isolate physically interacting CD4+, MHCII+ multiplets from the lungs.\n With these preliminary data and tools, we now aim to define mechanisms of CD4 T cell help in TB,\ncharacterized as either direct (local, requiring cell-cell contact with APCs) or indirect (global, impacting both\nAPCs and non-APCs). Using adoptive transfer of CD4 T cells from wild type or knockout mice into T cell\ndeficient recipients, we will define how distinct CD4 T cell-derived effector functions drive myeloid cell\nactivation and control of intracellular Mtb among APCs and non-APCs. By advancing our studies of mice that\nlack MHCII among monocyte derived APCs in the lungs, we will newly define how of antigen presentation in\nthe lungs drives different CD4 T cell functions and determine whether this differs depending on the antigen\nrecognized. We will test the hypothesis that antigen presentation by monocyte derived APCs governs\nmechanisms of both direct and indirect help. With our innovative approach to isolating physically interacting\nmultiplets composed of CD4 effector T cells and Mtb-infected MHCII+ cells, we will discover bidirectional gene\nexpression programs that are highly associated with immune synapse formation in the lungs. We will use\nChipCytometry on sorted multiplets to spatially characterize the protein expression characteristics of each cell\ncontributing to the synapse. Using bone marrow chimeric mice, combined with bulk and multiplet-RNA-Seq, we\nwill determine the role and requirement of essential CD4 T cell effector functions in direct CD4 T cell help\ndelivered at the immune synapse. By providing new information about the ways that CD4 T cells protect the\nhost against TB, the studies will inform and accelerate the development of more effective TB vaccines.",

    "abstract_text": "CD4 T cells are essential for protection against tuberculosis (TB). But current approaches to TB therapy have\nnot harnessed their potential benefit, and the mechanisms they use to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)\nhave not been completely defined. At the peak of adaptive immunity to TB, millions of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells\ntraffic to the lungs, but very few of them re-encounter their cognate antigen to become activated. The ability to\nclearly discriminate and isolate these few activated cells from the greater population of inactive CD4 T cells could\nenable the discovery of important new markers, effector functions, and clonally expanded T cell receptor (TCR)\nsequences closely associated with protective immunity. To study activated CD4 T cells from Mtb-infected lungs,\nwe used a new approach that combines: (i) a reporter mouse to identify cells actively receiving TCR stimulation\nin vivo (Nur77-GFP); (ii) BSL3-contained fluorescence cell sorting to isolate them live from tissues; and (iii) single\ncell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) with CITE-Seq and TCR immune-profiling to interrogate their function and\nantigen-specificity. In our preliminary work, we discovered that Nur77-GFPHI CD4 T cells express an array of\nactivation markers and costimulatory receptors including OX40. This population was enriched for T regulatory\ncells and effector T cells with TCR clonotypes localizing to lung parenchyma. Using adoptive transfer, we found\nthat Nur77-GFPHI cells are more protective than their Nur77-GFPLO counterparts. To therapeutically harness\nactivated CD4 T cells in vivo, we treated Mtb-infected mice with a monoclonal antibody that agonizes OX40 and\nfound that this treatment reduced the lung bacterial burden, prolonged survival of infected mice by >100 days\nand did not cause toxicity. Immunotherapy specifically targeting activated CD4 T cells is a novel approach to TB\ntreatment that has not been thoroughly investigated. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will define the function of\nactivated CD4 T cells in the lungs of Mtb-infected mice using scRNA-Seq and CITE-Seq. With adoptive transfer\nand scTCR-Seq, we will uncover how antigen specificity shapes the function and fate of different CD4 T cell TCR\nclonotypes throughout chronic infection. We will use TCR sequences we generate to develop TCR retrogenic\nmice that can identify protective Mtb antigens and test the hypothesis that antigen specificity shapes T cell\nphenotype in TB In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms underlying activation marker immunotherapy\nmediated CD4 T cell control of TB. We will test the hypothesis that OX40 agonist treatment provides protection\nby selectively modulating the function of both activated T conventional and T regulatory cells. Finally, we will\ndetermine how OX40 agonism impacts activated CD4 T cell survival through chronic infection. The studies\nproposed here represent the first high-definition characterization of the small population of activated CD4 T cells\nat the site of Mtb infection and the first study exploring the potential of OX40 activation marker targeted\nimmunotherapy in the mouse model of TB. This project will elucidate new mechanisms that may inform the\ndevelopment of more effective TB vaccines and lead to new therapeutic approaches to improve TB treatment.",

The candidate is\ncurrently an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Minnesota (UMN) in the Division of Infectious\nDiseases. The outlined proposal builds on the candidate\u2019s previous experience by adding new domains of\nexpertise in advanced T cell immunology, international collaborative patient-oriented research and human\nimmunology, and single cell transcriptomics. The training objectives are represented by the mentorship team of\nMarc Jenkins and David Boulware, and other key collaborators at UMN. The proposed experimental and\ndidactic work will position the candidate with a unique set of cross-disciplinary skills that will enable his\ntransition to independence as a physician scientist focused on the immunology of TB.\n A better understanding of the factors that govern CD4 T cell function in TB could help guide the\ndevelopment of vaccine candidates more likely to elicit protective immunity against TB disease. It is becoming\nclearer that IFN-g secretion is only one protective function of CD4 T cells in TB. The other key effector\nmechanisms of CD4 T cells in TB are still being defined, and the determinants of these immune functions\nremain to be fully characterized. The overall scientific objectives of this particular project are to characterize\nCD4 T cell functions at the site of infection and to define how antigen availability and T cell receptor (TCR)-\nepitope affinity govern these functions. The premise of this proposal is that effector activity of CD4 T cells at\nthe site of TB infection is determined by characteristics of the Mtb antigen targeted. The central hypotheses are\n1) that CD4 T cells with lower affinity TCRs, targeting Mtb antigens with moderate abundance, have more\ndiverse and superior functions, and 2) that antigen specific CD4 T cells at the site of infection perform key\neffector functions outside the Th1 paradigm. To test these hypotheses, the following aims are proposed: Aim\n1: Determine how antigen-intrinsic factors govern CD4 T cell function in TB, and Aim 2: Characterize CD4 T\ncell function and diversity at the site of human TB infection. To accomplish these aims, innovative approaches\nare proposed including: modulation of Mtb gene expression in vivo, identification of lower affinity TCRs, and\nunbiased identification of CD4 T cells that have recently received TCR stimulation in vivo. By pairing these\napproaches in the mouse model with studies of human T cells from the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with\nHIV-associated TB meningitis, using single cell transcriptomic profiling, these studies will characterize how Mtb\nantigen-intrinsic factors elicit CD4 T cell populations of varying functional capacity and diversity.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThis proposal introduces advanced techniques like three-photon optical imaging, two-photon optogenetics and\ntwo-photon photothrombosis to determine the precision of blood flow control across different layers of the\nneocortex, both in healthy animals and after inducing single capillary strokes. Our approach is significant for\ninterpreting fMRI data, particularly laminar fMRI which links high-level brain functions to specific cortical layers.\nAn fMRI signal is certainly triggered by neural activity-dependent dilation of arteries which then leads to\ndownstream changes in blood flow in capillaries and veins. A neural trigger of a hemodynamic event does not\nmean that the full enunciation of the vascular response is going to match the neural event, or that the vascular\nresponse could be used to faithfully predict the underlying neural event. Our prevailing hypothesis suggests\nthat if the artery dilation propagates from one functional cortical domain to an adjacent domain, a mismatch\nbetween neural and hemodynamic signals will occur. If the neural feature map lacks sufficient clustering, a\nmismatch will also occur. Tight matching between neural and vascular signals occurs when the stimuli are\ngeneric or when only the responses to the preferred stimulus in a functional domain is analyzed. A popular\napproach in neurovascular coupling research has been to use sparse sampling of neural activity via LFP and\nsingle-unit electrode recordings. Relating these electrical signals to vascular responses is controversial\nbecause different results are obtained with each new study: spikes match hemodynamics, LFP match vascular\nresponses, or that spikes, LFPs and vascular responses are all tightly coupled. Multi-photon imaging has sub-\ncellular resolution and eliminates sampling bias. We previously examined some aspects of neurovascular\ncoupling in layer 2/3 of the neocortex. We imaged visually evoked responses in neurons and synapses that\nsurrounded individual blood vessels in a non-rodent model system. We previously ignored neurovascular\ncoupling within cortical layer 1 because it has a low density of neurons. However, layer 1 is well suited to\ncontrast neurovascular coupling (Aim 1) with other cortical layers because there is no recurrent excitation from\nneighboring neurons in layer 1. New technical advances such as three-photon microscopy now enable us to\nprobe the strength of neurovascular coupling in layer 4 which is very deep in non-rodents, typically 850\u20131150\n\u03bcm below the brain surface (Aim 2). New techniques also allow us to test our prevailing hypothesis on the\n\u201cpropagation of dilation\u201d from one functional domain into the immediately adjacent one and whether a single\ncapillary stroke in layer 2/3 can disrupt neural function across cortical columns (Aim 3). Our research provides\nground truth and mechanistic data that will specify where and why selective neural signals may be decoded\nfrom hemodynamic signals in specific cortical layers. Our preliminary data suggests that there is no \u201cone-size-\nfits-all\u201d coupling function across cortical layers. In the long-term, our approach could uncover the neurovascular\nunderpinnings of neurological diseases such as vascular cognitive impairment.",

Despite this critical role, the mechanism by which cell-to-cell\ntransmission enables this evasion of antiretroviral therapies and immune responses\nremains poorly understood. In particular, the architecture of HIV-1 transmission sites\nin their native, frozen-hydrated state has been challenging. Previous imaging\ntechniques, such as traditional electron microscopy, have been limited by sample\npreparation artifacts that obscure the true structural details of these transmission\nsites.\nOur proposal aims to use advanced in situ correlative cryoimaging techniques to\nexplore the ultrastructure of HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission in primary T lymphocytes.\nPreliminary data using this approach challenges the prevailing hypothesis that viral\ntransmission requires numerous viruses in a large intercellular space. Instead, our\nfindings suggest that transmission occurs in small, confined spaces containing only\n1-3 viruses, enclosed by narrow membrane interfaces that may hinder access by\nbroadly neutralizing antibodies and antiviral drugs.\nThrough two specific aims, we will (1) determine the architecture of HIV-1\ntransmission sites in primary T cells using correlative in situ cryoimaging and (2)\ninvestigate the molecular determinants of viral entry and infection in both free-virus\nand cell-to-cell transmission. The outcome of this research are insights into the\nmechanisms driving efficient viral spread which can inform therapeutic strategies\nspecifically designed to target and impair cell-to-cell transmission\u2014a critical aspect\ncurrently overlooked in existing treatments.",

The CREATE program is an integrated residential 10 week summer research experience that motivates and/or affirms student interest in pursuing a research career, and provides students with foundational skills required for entry into and success in a graduate or MD/PhD program. The foundation of our program is the completion of an independent cancer biology research project under the mentorship of a University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center faculty member. We enrich this research experience with regular group meetings to discuss research and develop presentation skills, introduction to core concepts in cancer biology, emerging cancer biology research topics and cancer research career pathways, and the development of professional skills critical for admission to and success in a graduate program. Based on our ability to recruit a talented cohort of students, and outstanding student outcomes in the initial funding period, we are requesting continued support for the CREATE program. We will recruit 18 students each year, with 6 students participating in a novel \u201cMSTP track\u201d where students will be mentored by a physician scientist and participate in additional MD/PhD-specific enrichment activities. The rationale for this new track is based on success with a pilot in the previous funding period, and the need to increase the physician scientist pipeline. For all CREATE students, we have used our evaluation results to revise our cancer biology-specific activities, provide mentor training to all program participants, and focus our professional development activities on supporting and enhancing mentoring relationships, writing personal statements and interviewing. The CREATE program benefits from strong partnerships with the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center and the Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD). We work extensively with the Life Sciences Summer Undergraduate Research Programs, a long-standing umbrella organization that coordinates the activities of several distinct summer research programs at Minnesota. This relationship enhances our recruitment efforts, maximizes administrative efficiencies, and provides additional enrichment activities that complement and enhance CREATE. Continuous quality improvement driven by our evaluation plan will allow us to continue to enhance the student experience and positively impact short-term and long-term measures of success.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT:\nDevelopment of effective and robust treatments for diseases caused by apicomplexan parasites is an ongoing\nmedical and veterinary challenge. Since natural products are a proven source of effective and robust\ntherapeutics against parasitic infections, we mined marine sources for anti-Toxoplasma and\nanti-Cryptosporidium activity. These screens identified a marine natural product, tartrolon E (trtE), with broad\nanti-apicomplexan activity in vitro and in vivo. Repeated attempts to select trtE-resistant T. gondii or P.\nfalciparum mutants were unsuccessful implying that conservation of the trtE target is essential for parasite\nviability. To identify the target of trtE, we conducted a drug affinity response target stability (DARTS) assay.\nProteins that were protected from proteolysis by the presence of trtE were identified by quantitative mass\nspectrometry. Two rhoptry proteins were highly enriched in trtE treated samples, TgROPLMF, and TgROP14.\nBoth proteins are integral membrane proteins with a lipase maturation factor (LMF) domain. LMF-domain\ncontaining proteins are present in most all apicomplexans (ortholog group OG6_106580) consistent with trtE\u2019s\nbroad spectrum activity. The only apicomplexan lacking an obvious ortholog for the LMF domain containing\nproteins is Cryptosporidium. Our preliminary data lead us to hypothesize that TgROPLMF and TgROP14 are\ntargets of trtE\u2019s activity, and that trtE\u2019s inhibition of the LMF domain proteins has downstream effects on\nproteins that interact with TgROPLMF. We will test these hypotheses through the completion of the following\naims. Aim 1: To determine if the LMF domain proteins mediate the anti-parasitic activity of trtE:\nToxoplasma parasites lacking TgROPLMF1, TgROP14, both proteins, or parasites overexpressing\nTgROPLMF, will be generated, validated and characterized. The susceptibility of the recombinant parasites to\ntrtE, as compared to wild-type parasites, will be quantified in assays that evaluate inhibition of invasion and\nintracellular replication. Aim 2: To identify the interactome of TgROPLMF and TgROP14 and evaluate\ntrtE\u2019s ability to disrupt the TgROPLMF interactome. The interactome of the LMF domain containing proteins\nwill be identified by proximity labeling with TurboID. Interacting proteins will be validated by endogenous\ntagging and tracking in wild type and recombinant parasites, and the ability of trtE to alter the TgROPLMF\ninteractome tested. Aim 3: Identify putative trtE targets in Cryptosporidium parvum. Cryptosporidium is\nthe only apicomplexan susceptible to trtE that lacks LMF domain proteins. In this aim our DARTS strategy will\nbe repeated with sporozoites to identify putative targets in C. parvum. If the LMF domain proteins are trtE\ntargets, we will have identified eminently druggable targets common to apicomplexan pathogens, providing\nlead compounds for new therapeutic strategies for diseases caused by apicomplexan parasites.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAn estimated 3 million US adults suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a group of conditions primarily\nincluding ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) and are characterized by chronic or recurring\ninflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. While anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant drugs are available\nto control symptoms (remission), the relapsing rate can be as high as 75% and challenges exist to effectively\nmaintain remission and improve quality of life. Prebiotic fibers and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) generally\nhave beneficial effects on intestinal physiology, and butyrate is the preferred oxidizable fuel for colonocytes. On\nthe other hand, dietary fat exacerbates experimental colitis, and its overconsumption is associated with the global\nincrease in the prevalence of UC. The proposed project aims to understand how excessive fat in diet perturbs\ncolonic metabolism of butyrate and subsequently leads to elevated mucosal inflammation. One notable\nalternative fate of butyrate in colonocytes is to generate ketone bodies including acetoacetate (AcAc) and D-\u03b2-\nhydroxybutyrate (D-\u03b2HB). There is a significant knowledge gap regarding the pathophysiological function of\nmucosal ketone bodies. In Aim 1, we propose to test the hypothesis that terminal oxidation of butyrate in\ncolonocytes suppresses while ketogenesis promotes intestinal inflammation. We will first perform stable isotope\ntracing experiments to determine butyrate\u2019s fate during colitis. Using genetic mouse models, we will determine\nfunctional outcomes of terminally oxidative vs. ketogenic metabolism of butyrate in colitis. In Aim 2, we seek to\nunderstand how high-fat diet (including ketogenic diet) promotes the colonocyte-macrophage ketone shuttle to\ndrive inflammation. We will test the hypothesis that the fat-sensitive PPAR\u03b1 signaling, by counteracting the\ntissue-reparative type 2 immune response, activates colonic beta-oxidation and ketogenesis to potentiate gut\ninflammation. Intestinal macrophages, predominantly derived from monocytes via a \u201cwaterfall\u201d differentiation\nprocess, are the gatekeepers of mucosal homeostasis. In Aim 3, we hypothesize that the utilization of locally\nproduced ketone body, specifically AcAc, induce the formation of Spp1+ macrophages to drive inflammation.\nTaken together, we expect to find that dietary fat induces the metabolic switch from butyrate terminal oxidation\nto ketogenesis in colonocytes, which reprograms intestinal macrophages to form a pro-inflammatory milieu. The\nproposed study will provide valuable insights into the metabolic underpinnings of UC etiopathogenesis and the\ndevelopment of future therapies and dietary advice for UC patients.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nMore than 1.5 billion people are infected with helminths worldwide, predominantly distributed in tropical and\nsubtropical areas. On the other hand, in developed countries with markedly reduced infectious diseases, there\nis a continuing increase in the incidences of allergic, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases. The hygiene\nhypothesis proposes that an under-stimulated immune system resulting from the absence of exposure to\nhelminths, predisposes to autoimmune and allergic inflammation. There is an urgent need for new preventive\nand therapeutic medicines for mucosal infection and inflammation. The research in my laboratory has been\nfocused on the pathophysiological role of O-linked N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification on intracellular\nproteins at serine and threonine residues. The long-term goal is to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms and\nphysiological functions of O-GlcNAc signaling in intestinal homeostasis and mucosal host defense. In the\nproposed study, we will test the hypothesis that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), by activating STAT6 signaling,\npromotes the differentiation of IL-25-producing tuft cells and facilitates IL-33 secretion from goblet cells, thus\nevoking type 2 immune responses for tissue repair and inflammation control. In Aim 1, we seek to define the\nfunctional impact, upstream activating signals, and downstream targets of STAT6 O-GlcNAcylation in tuft cell\ndifferentiation, type 2 immune activation, and helminth expulsion. In Aim 2, we identify a novel, common target\nof OGT and STAT6 that colocalizes with IL-33 in goblet cells and mediates the unconventional secretion of IL-\n33 to initiate type 2 immune responses. In Aim 3, using pharmacological and genetic approaches to increase\nglobal protein O-GlcNAcylation in the intestinal epithelium, we expect to establish that the OGT-STAT6 pathway\nis required for intestinal homeostasis and mediates the therapeutic effect of helminths in colitis. The proposed\nstudy will provide valuable insights into the development of new intervention strategies to eradicate parasitic\nworms in areas of poverty in the developing world and to treat inflammatory bowel disease in industrialized\ncountries.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nCD8 T cells are potent killers of cells presenting foreign antigens, making them powerful to fight microbial\ninfections. The fetal host immune defense against pathogenic microbes is underdeveloped and ill-equipped to\ndefend against microbial infection and heavily relies on maternal host immune responses to prevent the\ndissemination of pathogenic microbes. However, the fetus also expresses immunologically foreign allo-\nantigens, which if recognized by CD8 T cells, could threaten its survival. The maternal-fetal interface (MFI),\nwhere fetal and maternal mucosal tissues intertwine, is a critical location for preventing the dissemination of\npathogenic microbes and maintaining tolerance for allo-antigens. Major gaps in knowledge relating to CD8 T\ncell biology, tolerance, and pathology at the MFI have persisted due in large part to necessary restriction on\nusing human cells and tissues for research. In addition, conventional specific pathogen free (SPF) mouse\nmodels fail to recapitulate human CD8 T cell biology and diversity, both systemically and in tissues, making\nthem inadequate for studies on CD8 T cells at the MFI. In SPF mice, CD8 T cells make up 0.5-2% of MFI\nleukocytes and have a na\u00efve phenotype. Conversely, we recently discovered that natural microbial exposure\nexpanded CD8 T cells to 6% of leukocytes at the MFI and phenocopied human CD8 T cells with high fidelity.\nThis proposal uses innovative natural microbial exposure as a more faithful model system of human CD8 T cell\nbiology. Natural microbial exposure expanded CD8 T cell numbers and generated additional CD8 T cell\ndiversity including effector, memory, tissue resident and dysfunctional CD8 T cell types that we also observed\nat the human MFI. We utilize this model as well as human tissues to gain mechanistic understanding of factors\nthat modulate CD8 T cell tolerance and host immune defense against pathogenic microbes at the MFI. We will\ncompare the immune regulation of CD8 T cells are a result of exposure to a natural microbiome or pathogens\nboth systemically in blood and lymphoid tissues as well as locally in the mucosal tissues. These mechanistic\ninvestigations of adaptive CD8 T cell responses will identify tissue localized CD8 T cell types, their receptors\nand specificity, as well as the beneficial and pathogenic host factors providing immune protection for\npathogenic microbes while maintaining immune tolerance. Further, these experiments will lay the groundwork\nfor improved preclinical models investigating biomarkers, treatments, and preventions for immune pathologies\nat the MFI.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThe immunology of pregnancy is complex and delicately balanced. While failure to tolerate fetal antigens\nduring pregnancy can result in fetal loss, ineffective immunity to pathogens can threaten the survival of both\nthe fetus and the mother. Fetal tissues and the maternal immune system continuously communicate to\nmaintain this balance. This proposal focuses on two understudied mechanisms of maternal-fetal\ncommunication: extracellular vesicles (EVs) \u2013 lipid-bound particles carrying immunomodulatory proteins and\nmiRNAs secreted by cells, and maternal microchimeric cells (MMc) \u2013 the vertical transfer of maternal immune\ncells to fetal organs. Specifically, we aim understand how these processes are influenced by normal microbial\nexperience to better understand their function during normal pregnancies. Much of what we know about EVs\nand MMc during pregnancy has been discovered using conventional specific pathogen free (SPF) mouse\nmodels, which have limited microbial diversity and are nearly devoid of pathogens. These artificially hygienic\nconditions are in stark contrast to nature, where microbes are ubiquitous and diverse. Indeed, we and others\nhave demonstrated that the immune systems of mice raised under SPF conditions are underdeveloped relative\nto humans and feral/pet store mice. We posit that the character and function of EVs and MMc in SPF\npregnancies are impaired by the lack of diverse microbial experience, thus reducing the predictive power of\nSPF studies. Our lab has developed a preconception normal microbial experience (pNME) model whereby\nlaboratory mice are cohoused with pet store mice prior to breeding to naturally expose them to the diverse\nmicrobial communities. Cohousing continues throughout gestation and early life, ensuring the offspring receive\n\u2018mature\u2019 maternal factors and encounter diverse microbes from the earliest natural time to replicate normal\nmammalian immune development more accurately. Using this model, we have found that the immune systems\nof pNME mice are broadly expanded and achieve immune developmental milestones earlier than SPF mice.\npNME mice also demonstrate enhanced survival and immune defense relative to SPF mice. The gap in\nimmunity between conventional SPF models and natural immune development has contributed to the slow\nprogress toward mechanistic understanding of maternal-fetal immune communication and fetal immune\ndevelopment. The proposed research describes a natural model of immune development (pNME) that\ncombines the ample resources and tools of laboratory mouse strains with physiological microbial experience to\ngain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of normal maternal-fetal immune communication and their\ninfluence on fetal immune development. Further, these experiments will lay the groundwork for improved\npreclinical models investigating biomarkers, treatments, and preventions for immune pathologies during\npregnancy and early life.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, with limited\ntreatment options, especially for patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors, which are largely resistant to\nimmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Despite advances in chemotherapy and targeted therapies, CRC treatment\nremains suboptimal, particularly in overcoming immunotherapy resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to\nidentify novel therapeutic strategies that can modulate the immune microenvironment and enhance the efficacy\nof ICIs to increase survival outcomes in advanced-stage CRC.\nOur high-throughput metabolomic and transcriptomic data analysis from CRC patients identified significant\nupregulation of the essential amino acid (eAA) transporter LAT1 in CRC tissues, particularly in MSS tumors.\nElevated LAT1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and immunosuppressive M2-like macrophages,\nsuggesting that LAT1 contributes to tumor immune evasion. Our preliminary studies showed that LAT1 inhibition\ndecreases tumor growth and improves T cell infiltration in the tumor. Based on these observations,\nwe hypothesize that LAT1 inhibition will reduce tumor growth and enhance antitumor immune responses by\nincreasing M1-like macrophages and CD8+ T cells in the tumor environment. We propose targeting LAT1 with\nthe JPH203, a LAT1-specific inhibitor, to synergize with ICI therapy to improve therapeutic outcomes in\nadvanced-stage CRC models.\nAim 1: Evaluate the impact of LAT1 inhibition on tumor growth and immune cell infiltration using an orthotopic\nCRC model.\nAim 2: Evaluate the effect of the LAT1-specific inhibitor JPH203, alone and in combination with ICIs, in reducing\ntumor burden and enhancing immune responses in advanced-stage CRC models.\nImpact: This project will elucidate the role of LAT1 in CRC and explore the therapeutic potential of LAT1 inhibition\nin combination with ICIs. By targeting LAT1, we aim to overcome immunotherapy resistance and improve\noutcomes for CRC patients, particularly those with MSS tumors.",

    "abstract_text": "Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are the most common cause of orofacial pain not related to teeth,\naffecting 5-12% of the population, and 15% of patients seeking treatment will develop chronic TMD with a\ngreater prevalence in females. Jaw muscle pain (myalgia) is the most common TMD diagnosis, usually mildly\npresent at rest which gets aggravated with function, e.g., chewing, or parafunctional habits, e.g., teeth\nclenching. Such habits are frequently reported by patients, are strong predictors for TMD incidence and\nexperimentally they can induce jaw pain/fatigue in controls and aggravate symptoms in patients. Putative\nfactors for jaw pain onset and persistence include intrinsic muscle metabolic features related to function. Jaw\nfunction tests that evoke symptoms mimicking \u201creal-life\u201d situations are necessary to determine mechanisms of\njaw pain and fatigue in chronic TMD. Example models include teeth clenching at maximum force, chewing\nwax/gum or clenching at pre-defined forces relative to the individual maximum voluntary bite force. Outcome\nmeasures include clenching endurance and magnitude of pain/fatigue intensities. Common to most models is a\nfocus on fixed parameters, typically muscle contraction at pre-specified levels. However, little attention has\nbeen directed to models whose stimulus-induced outcome is a targeted magnitude of sensation, e.g. moderate\npain/fatigue, and the jaw muscle effort required for induction. There is a critical need for new models of jaw\nfunction that closely emulate known risk factors for TMD pain. This proposal will address this unmet need by\ndeveloping and validating a novel jaw metabolic stressor (JMS) task to determine the jaw muscle metabolic\nstress and brain functional characteristics related to jaw pain perception during function. The JMS task is\ndesigned for chairside and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses at high (3T) and ultra-high (7T) field. The\nfollowing aims are proposed: 1. Develop and validate a JMS task able to evoke targeted intensities of jaw pain\nand fatigue in pain-free controls; 2. Determine the jaw muscle effort required to evoke moderate jaw pain and\nfatigue in chronic TMD pain cases and matched controls using a JMS task; 3. Demonstrate feasibility of using\na JMS task during functional MRI to evoke brain functional activations secondary to targeted jaw pain and\nfatigue levels in chronic TMD pain cases and matched controls. In Aim 1, a psychophysics-based JMS task will\nbe validated by contrasting it to traditional models of jaw function by comparing the targeted jaw pain/fatigue\nintensities and jaw muscle blood oxygenation evoked by each model, and its reliability will be determined from\ntest-retest assessment. Aim 2 will use similar methods as Aim 1 to compare the jaw muscle effort required to\nachieve a targeted intensity of jaw pain/fatigue for chronic TMD pain cases and matched pain-free controls.\nFinally, Aim 3 includes feasibility testing for JMS task performance during MRI in both high and ultra-high\nfields. It is anticipated that a valid and reliable JMS task designed for chairside and MRI uses will render a new\nmethod to investigate peripheral and central neural mechanisms of jaw pain/fatigue in chronic TMD.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nThe safe and effective ways to care for patients after acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant unknown in the\nmedical field and one of growing attention. There is significant uncertainty about use of kidney-protecting\nmedications in patients who have had AKI because many of those medications, paradoxically, reduce kidney\nfunction when initiated or resumed before their kidney-protecting qualities become apparent. This leads to\ndeferral of therapy for many patients who have had recent AKI and other risk-factors, like chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus. These patients are actually at heightened risk for multiple adverse\noutcomes that kidney-protecting medications prevent. Such deferrals may even become indefinite. The newest\nof these medication classes being impacted by these post-AKI practices are sodium-glucose cotransporter-2\n(SGLT2) inhibitors, which are first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes and are known to prevent progression of\nCKD and cardiovascular events. Observational studies, including those published by the applicant Dr. Daniel\nMurphy, show favorable outcomes when SGLT2 inhibitors are provided after AKI to those with type 2 diabetes.\nNow Dr. Murphy seeks to translate these findings into a pilot, pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial (RCT)\nbased in primary care clinics to demonstrate the feasibility of an intervention to increase use of SGLT2\ninhibitors after AKI (Aim 1). Nested within the pilot RCT, Dr. Murphy seeks to conduct a qualitative study\nfocused on the experience of primary care providers and pharmacists and, separately, patients, within the pilot\nRCT. These interviews will identify barriers to prescribing, receiving, and taking a SGLT2 inhibitor and the\nperceived impact of our study\u2019s intervention, which will help Dr. Murphy craft changes to the study intervention\nfor designing a future RCT based on all his K23 results (Aim 2). In parallel with these efforts, Dr. Murphy will\nuse electronic health record-data from patients with type 2 diabetes and AKI to determine predictors of SGLT2\ninhibitor receipt, which could be used in identifying patients to recruit for a future RCT after this pilot study (Aim\n3). Paired with applicable training, these research questions in this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research\nCareer Development Award will position Dr. Murphy as an independent clinical researcher equipped in both\npragmatic RCT design and conduct alongside his skillset in using observational data to identify potential\ntreatments and strategies that may improve clinical outcomes. His career will include investigating treatments\nto care for patients who have suffered AKI though observational and interventional means.",

The disease causes significant morbidity and mortality for patients: With\ntoday's treatments, patients face a significant risk of death, high relapse rates, and only a rare chance at full\nremission. Better therapies are possible, but our limited understanding of the genetic and immunologic\nmechanisms that lead to AIHA are roadblocks to making new treatments a reality. Fortunately, dogs provide an\nexceptional naturally occurring model for studying genetic risk factors and T cell biology in AIHA. The disease\nis naturally occurring in both humans and dogs, and shares similar clinical, genetic, and immunologic\nunderpinnings in both species \u2013 while occurring significantly more frequently in dogs compared to humans.\nThe goal of this study is to lay the groundwork for a canine model system to study AIHA by identifying genetic\nrisk factors for the disease and by characterizing the autoreactive T cell population in two highly predisposed\ndog breeds. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that we will identify multiple genetic risk variants affecting\nhumoral immunity, along with autoreactive CD4+ T cells that are activated by peptides derived from RBC\nsurface antigens. Once we identify genetically predisposed dogs and the T cell epitopes that trigger AIHA, we\ncan begin to develop and test approaches that manipulate or downregulate the aberrant immune response in\nhighly predisposed animals. Ultimately, we expect to use this canine model system to drive advances in our\nunderstanding of AIHA and foster the development of novel immunotherapies for humans. The work proposed\nin this application will be completed by a highly collaborative team of scientists anchored at the renowned\nCenter for Immunology at the University of Minnesota Medical School, the University Minnesota College of\nVeterinary Medicine, and the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine.",

The mission of the MPaT program is to cultivate the next generation of pharmacologists who will lead or contribute to efforts yielding new therapeutic approaches for our most vexing health challenges. While recent program changes have fostered growth, enhanced its governance structure, and addressed succession planning concerns, there remain several opportunities for improvements that could enhance the training experience for students and faculty alike. The overarching objective of efforts described in this application is to transform the MPaT graduate program so that it better equips our students with the skills needed to conduct impactful research and become leaders in the evolving biomedical workforce. This goal will be achieved by implementation of a plan that includes critical updates to the MPaT curriculum, investments in recruitment and retention, augmented career development activities, mentorship training for preceptors, and continual improvement driven by comprehensive program evaluation. The plan is guided by student-facing objectives that align with desirable competencies related to scientific knowledge, technical and analytical skill development, communication, and the self-efficacy that develops over the course of an independent research project, as well as program-facing objectives including enhanced retention rate and research outcomes for all students. NIGMS support is requested for 5 students per year for the first 2 years in the program. This support, combined with institutional funding, will help the MPaT program meet its goal of matriculating 12 incoming students per year and training approximately 60 students across all cohorts. All MPaT students will complete 7 courses that give them a solid grounding in quantitative and systems pharmacology; underscore the importance of rigorous experimental design, responsible conduct of research, and team-based learning and problem-solving; and afford many opportunities to refine skills in scientific communication. This core curriculum will be supplemented by a computational course and data management workshop, and electives that permit program individualization. Student engagement with the Pharmacology Seminar Series and Retreat will foster awareness of research challenges and opportunities in contemporary pharmacology and provide networking opportunities. For their mentored research experience, students will select an advisor from among a talented and dedicated group of preceptors who share an interest in translating molecular, cellular, and organ systems-level insights into novel approaches to diagnose and/or treat human ailments and disease. Students can further tailor the training experience by engaging with experiential learning opportunities designed to give them exposure to careers-of-interest and facilitate their transition into the biomedical workforce. The training experience overall will be enhanced by the vast resources at UMN that foster safe, rigorous, and impactful research, and the strong institutional commitment to program success.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY\nDysregulation of inhibitory G protein-dependent signaling, including signaling controlled by the GABAB receptor\n(GABABR), is implicated in many neurological disorders and diseases. In the hippocampus (HPC), GABABR\nexerts much of its inhibitory influence by activating G protein-gated Inwardly Rectifying K+ (GIRK/Kir3) channels\nand by inhibiting Adenylyl Cyclase (AC). We have shown that GABABR-GIRK signaling in the HPC is modulated\nby Regulator of G protein Signaling (RGS) proteins of the R7 sub-family, which sharpen the timing and dampen\nthe sensitivity of this signaling pathway. The R7 RGS sub-family includes RGS6 and RGS7, which form stable\ncomplexes with G\uf0625. Genetic ablation of RGS7/G\uf0625 complexes in mice profoundly alters GABABR-GIRK\nsignaling, disrupting synaptic plasticity and HPC-dependent behaviors. R7 RGS/G\uf0625 complexes can also\nassociate with adaptor proteins, including the small palmitoylated protein R7BP and an orphan Class C GPCR\n(GPR158). Our recent work suggests the intriguing prospect that discrete R7 RGS/G\uf0625 complexes, together with\nR7BP and GPR158, play an essential role in the selective routing of GABABR signals to GIRK channels or AC.\nThese findings fuel our central hypothesis that R7 RGS/G\uf0625 complexes and their adaptors orchestrate the\nassembly of inhibitory \"signalosomes\u201d \u2013 distinct physical and/or functional arrays of receptors, G proteins, RGS\nand related proteins, and effectors \u2013 to ensure the dedicated and selective regulation of effector enzymes and\nion channels by GABABR. To test this innovative hypothesis, we propose a multi-disciplinary program with two\nAIMs: 1) Identify mechanisms mediating GABABR-effector signaling dynamics and compartmentalization. We\nwill employ loss- and gain-of-function/rescue genetic manipulations in HPC pyramidal neurons, along with\nelectrophysiological and real-time optical assessments of GABABR-effector signaling, to test the prospect that\ndiscrete R7 RGS/G\uf0625 complexes and their adaptors, working in concert with their inhibitory G protein substrates,\norchestrate the assembly of distinct and dedicated GABABR-GIRK and GABABR-AC signalosomes. 2)\nInterrogate the organization of the GABABR-GIRK signalosome. Leveraging insights derived from our recent\ncrystal structure of RGS7/G\uf0625 and associated predictive modeling, we will use cell-based biochemical and\noptical reporter assays, as well as orthogonal biochemical reconstitution approaches, to test hypotheses related\nto interactions and interfaces among GABABR-GIRK signalosome elements. Structural insights into GABABR-\nGIRK signalosome assembly will then be exploited to probe the functional relevance of specific interactions.\nSummary: Our efforts will reveal whether R7 RGS/G\uf0625 complexes and adaptors orchestrate selective signaling\nbetween GABABR and its effectors. This project will yield new mechanistic insights into the functional and\nphysical compartmentalization of GABABR-effector signaling, knowledge that can be used to design novel\ntherapeutic interventions for neurological disorders and diseases characterized by aberrant GABABR-dependent\nsignaling.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY: Viral Innovation Core\nViral vectors are used extensively in neuroscience research to deliver an ever-expanding toolkit of genetically\nencoded reagents that can disrupt or modify gene expression, control the excitability of cells within circuits,\nidentify connections within and across brain regions, and help visualize real-time indices of cellular activity and\nneurotransmission with spatial and temporal precision. Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vectors are commonly\nused for this purpose given their broad tropism, ability to promote stable gene expression, and low cytotoxicity\nand immunogenicity profiles. AAV vectors are used by many investigators within the University of Minnesota\n(UMN) addiction research community. The demand for AAV vector production within this group has grown\nsteadily since the founding of the UMN Viral Vector and Cloning Core (VVCC) in 2017, driven in large part by\nfaculty hiring in the addiction neurosciences and NIH/NIDA support for the Center for Neural Circuits in Addiction\nand its Viral Innovation Core/VIC. The goal for the VIC in the next funding period is to sustain its positive impact\nby meeting the expanding AAV vector needs of the UMN addiction research community. The mission of the VIC\nis encapsulated in two AIMs: 1) Generating AAV vectors to support the UMN addiction research community. In\nthe initial project period, the VIC exceeded critical benchmarks related to AAV production, while also fueling the\ndevelopment and optimization of a pipeline of advanced vector characterization assays to evaluate AAV vector\nquality. In the next funding cycle, the VIC will build on its positive impact by increasing its support for AAV vector\ngeneration \u2013 including custom vectors that are in high demand \u2013 for the growing UMN addiction research\ncommunity. Centralization of AAV production represents a critical efficiency for Center Investigators and\nAffiliates, many of whom apply these tools to projects supported by other Research Cores. 2) Special Projects:\nEngineering tropism of AAV. In the initial project period, the VIC supported research into the \u201cengineerable\ncapacity\u201d of the AAV backbone. We were successful in identifying new capsid regions and strategies for adding\nbinding scaffolds (e.g., nanobodies) without impairing virus yield, post-entry steps, and infectivity. In the next\nfunding cycle, the VIC will leverage these new opportunities for viral vector engineering to test the hypothesis\nthat combining genetic elements for viral payload expression (e.g., promoters and enhancers) with receptor-\nmediated virus binding will result in synergy to more specifically target desirable cell populations of interest to\naddiction researchers. Summary. Tools generated by the VIC will meet the needs of Center Investigators and\nAffiliates as they pursue their innovative research projects and will promote engagement with the other Research\nCores. Furthermore, new multi-modal AAV targeting paradigms will benefit internal and external investigators\nwho strive for more refined targeting of cells and circuits relevant to substance use disorders.",

In the proposed work, we will develop and validate a sensitive\nand specific multiplexed targeted MS assay to quantify 9 of these diagnostic serous ovarian cancer protein\nbiomarkers in serum. This will be accomplished using Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM) MS, which is a\nhighly sensitive, selective and specific targeted MS method with a wide dynamic range and low limits of\nquantification, enabling streamlined method development and robust, multiplexed protein quantification. We\nwill evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of our multiplexed PRM assay in measuring these\nprioritized biomarker candidates using a panel of >1,300 serum samples obtained from a geographically\ndiverse cohort of women receiving gynecologic care at five cancer centers and academic health centers in the\nU.S. and one in Europe. Our multidisciplinary investigative team brings together researchers with diverse\nexpertise in analytical chemistry, clinical chemistry, ovarian cancer biology, epidemiology, and biostatistics.\nThe successful completion of the high impact pre-clinical studies described in this proposal will enable the\ndifferentiation of serous ovarian cancer patients from healthy patients based on the abundance of diagnostic\nserum protein biomarkers. This work will provide a foundation for the development and validation of novel\nmultiplexed PRM assays that could readily be applied to other ovarian cancer patient cohorts to support\ndiagnosis and early detection efforts.",

    "abstract_text": "Primary Immune Deficiencies (PID) are a heterogeneous class of diseases ascribed to individuals exhibiting\ndeficiency or severe impairment of cellular and/or humoral immunity. This proposal focuses on a form of PID\nassociated with radiation sensitivity and defects in V(D)J rearrangement caused by mutations in the DCLRE1C\n(Artemis) gene, \u201cART-SCID\u201d. Artemis is a hairpin-opening enzyme that plays an essential role in V(D)J\nrecombination, immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene rearrangement in immunodevelopment. The only\neffective therapy for ART-SCID is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), for which there is a\nsignificant risk of morbidity and mortality. Our team demonstrated that ex vivo lentiviral correction of Artemis\ndeficiency in a mouse model of SCID-A was most effectively accomplished using the endogenous Artemis\npromoter to regulate expression, forming the basis for our teams\u2019 clinical trial initiated in 2018 (NCT03538899).\nHowever, results from clinical trials using viral vectors have highlighted some of the limitations of genomically\ndispersed vector-mediated integration, such as genotoxicity associated with insertional oncogene activation,\ngenomic instability, transgene silencing, and disrupted proliferative control. What we envision in this\nproposal is the next generation of genetic therapies for Art-SCID by chromosomal site-directed\ncorrection of the endogenous Artemis gene in hematopoietic stem cells. The Specific Aims of this\nproposal address key questions in the development of a targeted genetic approach for therapy of ART-SCID\nand PID in general: Aim 1: What is the feasibility of targeted modification of the Artemis locus at a single\ngenetic lesion for restoration of immune function? To address this question, we have developed an Adenosine\nBase Editing (ABE) approach that functionally restores a TAA nonsense mutation in the Artemis gene that is\nprevalent in Navajo and Apache Native Americans. We have also established a new mouse strain transgenic\nfor the human TAA nonsense mutation (SCID-A mice). Using electroporation conditions that we have shown to\nbe effective for introduction of CRISPR gene editing reagents, in Aim 1 we will deliver ABE along with guide\nRNA targeting the Artemis TAA stop codon in mouse hematopoietic stem cells transplanted into recipient\nSCID-A mice, evaluating the animals for restored immunity. Aim 2: How can targeted genetic modification be\nextended from ex vivo to in vivo delivery of CRISPR reagents targeting the Artemis gene? In Aim 2 we will test\nadenovirus vectors and AAV vectors targeted to hematopoietic stem cells for in vivo delivery of ABE and\nrestoration of immunity in SCID-A mice. Results from these studies will have immediate implications for\ngenetic therapy of ART-SCID and by extension for therapy of PID in general.",

While\nthese enzymes play pivotal roles in defending against viruses and maintaining genomic integrity, their\ninvolvement in cancer mutagenesis makes them a double-edged sword, necessitating the development of\ninhibitors. This project's primary objective is to overcome the impediment of limited structural information, which\nhas been hampering the rational design of inhibitors for A3A and A3B. Aim 1 of this project focuses on elucidating\nthe structures of A3A and A3B when bound to viral inhibitors, specifically, Macacine \u03b3-herpesvirus 11 (McHV-11)\nand Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs). Utilizing cryo-electron\nmicroscopy (cryo-EM), this aim seeks to unravel the molecular intricacies of APOBEC inhibition evolved through\nhost-virus arms races, potentially paving the way for targeted therapeutics by comprehensively understanding\nthe host-virus interaction. Aim 2 expands the investigation to novel alpaca-derived nanobodies exhibiting\ninhibitory activity against A3A and A3B. Employing a tailored approach and introducing a large protein scaffold\nto enhance imaging resolution, this aim seeks to uncover unique mechanisms of APOBEC3 inhibition. By\nmapping the A3-nanobody binding interface, this study intends to engineer these nanobodies for improved\nbinding, with the ultimate goal of creating potent and specific A3-targeting degraders. This proposal seeks to\nbridge existing knowledge gaps regarding the structures and inhibition mechanisms of A3A and A3B. By\nadvancing our understanding of these crucial enzymes, this project aims to facilitate the rational design of A3A/B\ninhibitors, which will mitigate their mutagenic effects in cancer cells to slow tumor evolution and enhance the\nefficacy of cancer treatments.",

    "abstract_text": "Chronic pain is more prevalent in women, and the rapidly increasing list of mechanistic sex differences in pain signaling\nhas underscored the importance of considering sexual dimorphism in the development of therapies for chronic pain\nmanagement in women. Our long-term goal is to investigate sex differences in spinal dopaminergic mechanisms\nof persistent pain. The objective of this exploratory project is to define dorsal horn (DH) Drd1-expressing neurons\nand the function of Drd1 in a model of neuropathic pain. Our central hypothesis is that Drd1 participates in nerve\ninjury-induced hypersensitivity in a sexually dimorphic manner due in part to differential expression in DH\nneuronal subpopulations in male and female mice. Preliminary electrophysiological recordings demonstrate a\nstriking difference in the distribution of firing patterns of Drd1-expressing DH neurons in males and females. This\nobservation suggests sex differences in the expression of Drd1 among subsets of DH neurons that could\ncontribute to sex differences in spinal dopaminergic signaling under conditions of persistent pain. Drd1 is\nexpressed in a heterogeneous population of excitatory and inhibitory DH neurons and partially overlaps with\nmarkers of excitatory subpopulations that participate in tactile hypersensitivity. Therefore, excitatory Drd1\nneurons may participate in DH circuits, mediating nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity. On the other hand,\nincreased activation of DH Drd1 inhibitory neurons may contribute to disinhibition-mediated hyperexcitability\nunder conditions of persistent pain. We will address the potentially distinct functions of Drd1 in excitatory and\ninhibitory neurons using intersectional deletion of the receptor. The overall rationale for the proposed research\nis that it will identify specific mechanisms contributing to sex differences in spinal dopamine signaling, which\ncould be harnessed for more effective chronic pain management in women. In Aim 1, we will identify the pattern\nof Drd1 distribution among subsets of DH neurons in males and females. We will use fluorescent in situ hybridization\nanalysis to determine the expression of Drd1 in transcriptionally defined subtypes of DH neurons. We will also\ndefine the firing patterns and primary afferent inputs of excitatory and inhibitory Drd1 neurons using patch clamp\nelectrophysiology and will label recorded neurons with neurobiotin for neuroanatomical analysis. In Aim 2, we\nwill define the contribution of Drd1 in excitatory and inhibitory DH neurons to nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity\nin males and females, using an intersectional AAV-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene ablation approach; we will\ndetermine the functional impact of Drd1 ablation behaviorally. Impact: The proposed project will advance\nunderstanding of the mechanisms that underlie sex differences in chronic pain by elucidating the function of Drd1\nin nerve injury-induced hypersensitivity in female and male mice. This outcome will provide proof-of concept for\ncomprehensive investigation of sex differences in spinal dopamine signaling, extending to 1) other persistent\npain models, 2) the other dopamine receptors, which are also expressed in spinal cord, and 3) the descending\ndopaminergic inputs, which originate in hypothalamus and have been implicated in pain chronification.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nIn 2020, approximately 12 million adolescents were diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD)\nwhich arise from early life disturbances in key neurodevelopmental processes such as axonogenesis, synaptic\npruning, and neuronal migration. These disruptions in brain development lead to debilitating neurobehavioral\nand cognitive disabilities such as sensory processing disorders, language delays, and social deficits, which can\npresent as early as 6 months old. As such, the most effective therapies for NDD rely on early identification and\nintervention. This proposal aims to determine therapeutic targets during pregnancy with the goal of preventing\nneurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral consequences implicated in NDDs. Prenatal risk factors such as\nmaternal nutrition, immune activation, and stress modify the maternal gut microbiota and disrupt offspring brain\ndevelopment and behaviors, suggesting the maternal gut microbiota and its associated metabolites are poised\nto be critical regulators of neurodevelopment and offers the potential for microbiota-based therapeutics for\nNDDs. The study of maternal microbiome-based therapies for NDDs align with the mission of the NICHD to\n\u201c...improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all.\u201d\nMy preliminary data supports my central hypothesis that the maternal gut microbiota regulates key in utero\nmicrobial metabolites that promote thalamocortical development, allowing for typical adolescent\nsomatosensory and behaviors. Further, my data provides evidence that maternal gut regulated metabolites act\non embryonic microglia activity to shape thalamocortical circuit development and function that underlie\nadolescent somatosensory behavior. These findings support my rationale that the absence or disruption of the\nmaternal gut microbiota decreases the in utero bioavailability of key microbially modulated metabolites that are\nnecessary to shape microglia development and phagocytic activity at developing thalamocortical axons that\nthen mediate somatosensory circuit dysfunction and behaviors in adolescence. I propose to test my central\nhypothesis with the following aims: Aim 1: Determine how 4MM regulates embryonic thalamocortical neuron\nand microglia morphology, growth, and function; Aim 2: Investigate the role of in utero 4MM on adolescent\nsomatosensory circuitry and behaviors. The mechanistic approach that I have outlined in this proposal will\nelucidate a causal role of maternal gut microbiota associated metabolites on neurodevelopment and highlights\nthe potential for microbiome-based interventions to improve childhood outcomes and livelihood. By completing\nthe proposed research, I will identify a novel mechanism for how the maternal gut microbiota can regulate\noffspring brain development and behavior.\nMy proposed research is essential to my predoctoral training as I will develop and master technical skills,\nexperimental design and analysis, effective mentorship, and promote my contribution to the scientific field",

Amino acid biosynthetic\npathways represent promising drug targets because they are essential for Mtb growth but are absent in\nhumans. However, we do not yet know which of these pathways Mtb requires during infection or how their\ninhibition influences susceptibility to existing antibiotics. The overall objective of this exploratory proposal is to\ndetermine the potential of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis as a novel anti-tubercular drug target. The central\nhypothesis is that inhibition of Mtb Phe synthesis disrupts multiple central metabolic pathways to cause death\nof Mtb and enhance susceptibility to existing antibiotics. Preliminary data show that Mtb starved for Phe die in\nvitro and that a Phe auxotroph is rapidly cleared from acutely infected mice. Aim 1 will develop Mtb strains that\nconditionally express enzymes in the Phe biosynthesis pathway. These strains will be used in macrophage and\nmouse infection models to determine the extent to which Mtb requires Phe synthesis during infection and how\nPhe synthesis inhibition influences efficacy of existing anti-tubercular drugs. Aim 2 will use transcriptomic and\nmetabolomic analyses of Phe-starved Mtb to identify the metabolic changes and stress responses induced\nupon inhibition of Phe synthesis.

Mtb\nrequires the de novo riboflavin synthesis metabolic pathway for growth in vitro, but whether Mtb requires\nriboflavin synthesis during infection or can scavenge sufficient riboflavin from host tissues has not been directly\ntested. Knowledge of the Mtb riboflavin synthesis and transport mechanisms and their importance during\ninfection will be critical to exploit these pathways for development of new TB drugs. The overall objective of this\nproposal is to define the importance of riboflavin synthesis and transport to Mtb survival in the host. The central\nhypothesis is that Mtb requires de novo riboflavin synthesis for replication and/or survival during all stages of\nmammalian infection, despite the existence of dedicated riboflavin transporters, because it cannot acquire\nsufficient riboflavin from host tissues. Preliminary data using a Mtb strain that conditionally expresses RibA2,\nwhich catalyzes the first step of riboflavin synthesis, provide compelling support for this hypothesis, which will\nbe tested in three specific aims. Aim 1 will use the RibA2 conditional expression strain to determine the impact\nof riboflavin starvation on Mtb physiology and drug susceptibility and develop a panel of Mtb strains with\nhypomorphic expression of riboflavin synthesis enzymes to enable future drug discovery efforts. Aim 2 will\ndetermine the extent to which Mtb requires riboflavin synthesis in macrophage and mouse infection models\nusing the RibA2 conditional expression strain. Aim 3 will use a synthetic lethal genetic screen to identify Mtb\nriboflavin transporters. The approach uses innovative genetic strategies to identify mechanisms of riboflavin\ntransport and to identify synergy between riboflavin synthesis inhibition and existing anti-TB drugs. The\nproposed research is significant because it is expected to establish riboflavin synthesis as a viable target for\ndevelopment of new anti-TB drugs by demonstrating that riboflavin synthesis inhibition kills Mtb in mammalian\ninfection models and sensitizes Mtb to existing antibiotics. The proposal will also lay the foundation for high\nthroughput screens to identify small molecule riboflavin synthesis inhibitors with antibiotic activity.",

To justify the clinical translation of the protocol, a deep\nunderstanding of the immunobiology that determines maintenance and loss of immune tolerance is required.\nUsing highly multiplexed immunophenotyping and imaging methods customized for NHPs, our preliminary\nstudies comparing tissues from tolerant vs. rejecting NHPs led us to hypothesize that the spleen plays a crucial\nrole in maintaining tolerance to islet transplants in macaques.

Patients with SCA1 suffer from progressive gait and balance\ndeficits, and severe degeneration of Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellum. There are no effective disease\nmodifying therapies currently available for SCA1, indicating a critical need for better understanding of disease\npathogenesis.\nStudies using limited postmortem brain tissue from patients are complicated by practical and ethical concerns\nof tissue availability, late disease stage with the loss of neurons, and manipulation. Mouse models of SCA1\nhave been extremely useful in increasing our understanding of SCA1, but have important limitations due to the\ninherent species differences as well as genetic modifications, such as overexpression and much longer CAG\nexpansions than seen in patients, needed to model disease.\nBecause of these limitations, we propose to complement studies using mouse models with the investigations of\nhuman cells, including models of the human cerebellum. Recent study developed a robust and reproducible\nprotocol to generate human cerebellar organoids from iPSCs. We propose to use this protocol and our iPSCs\nlines from SCA1 patients and sibling controls to establish a human cerebellar organoid model of SCA1.

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\n The goal to effectively treat neurodegenerative disorders requires an understanding not only of neuronal\ndysfunction, but also of dysfunction of non-neuronal cells that can initiate and contribute to neuronal pathology.\nSpinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a fatal, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by the\nabnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the Ataxin 1 (ATXN1) gene. SCA1 patients suffer from progressive\nneuronal degeneration and reactive astrogliosis, especially in the cerebellum, leading to motor deficits. Despite\nintense research focus on the disease mechanisms in cerebellar neurons, there are no effective therapies\navailable to cure, delay or ameliorate SCA1.\n Astrocytes are brain cells that play fundamental roles in nearly all aspects of neuronal and brain\nfunction. Recently, using single-nuclei RNA sequencing we demonstrated that cerebellar astrocytes express\nAtxn1 at a level comparable to neurons (Borgenheimer et al., 2022). This raises a question of how mutant\nATXN1 in astrocytes impacts their function, contributes to neuronal pathology, and leads to SCA1-like disease\noutcomes. To fill this knowledge gap, we aim to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms though\nwhich mATXN1 affects cerebellar astrocytes, and how astrocyte dysfunctions contribute to the behavioral and\npathological changes that are observed in SCA1 disease onset and progression.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary.\nThe rodent-borne arenaviruses can cause severe hemorrhagic fevers; several of these potential pandemic\npathogens have been noted to cause high rates of maternal mortality, congenital infection, and/or fetal demise\nwhen pregnant people are infected. The objective of this project is to determine how arenavirus infection\ncauses adverse pregnancy outcomes. Clinical observations that Lassa virus (LASV) replicates to high titer in\nthe placenta prompted us to conduct a preliminary study using in vitro models of the human placenta and\nexperimental guinea pig infections with an arenavirus that is not pathogenic in humans, Pichinde virus (PICV),\nto ascertain the role of infection at the maternal fetal interface in severe disease. We found that PICV\nreplicates to high titers in undifferentiated and differentiated first trimester human trophoblasts and explants\nderived from term placenta. Furthermore, infection during pregnancy led to fetal demise, high viral loads in the\nplacenta and decidua, and low rates of congenital infection in guinea pigs. We hypothesize that the placenta\nand decidua serve as a reservoir for arenavirus replication and that the antiviral immune response to infection\nat the maternal-fetal interface leads to placental dysfunction. This project will use a combination of methods\nand models that include diverse New World (PICV and Junin virus [JUNV]) and Old World (LASV and\nlymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV]) viruses to reveal how arenaviruses circumvent host defense to\ninfect the placenta and cause severe disease. The placenta is generally an effective barrier against the\nbloodborne transmission of pathogens and primary trophoblasts are broadly restrictive to viral infection. Using\na genetically tractable model of the first trimester placenta, human trophoblast stem cells, and term placental\nexplants, we will investigate the viral factors that allow arenaviruses to circumvent innate and intrinsic immunity\nand establish productive infections in trophoblasts (Aim 1). We will next use guinea pigs to assess how the\nimmune response to arenavirus infection during pregnancy either causes placental dysfunction or may be\nharnessed to protect the mother and fetus (Aim 2). A detailed study of PICV pathogenesis at the maternal-fetal\ninterface will be complemented with experiments using JUNV and LASV to determine whether these highly\npathogenic viruses have a similar tropism for and effects on the placenta and decidua. The completion of this\nproject will address a critical knowledge gap by revealing the mechanisms by which arenaviruses damage the\nplacenta and cause pregnancy complications, informing the future development of much-needed therapies to\nminimize harm to pregnant people and their offspring.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract.\nHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common cause of congenital viral infections. HCMV\u2019s ability to\ninfect the placenta plays a central role in its pathogenesis during pregnancy. Placental infection can be\nsufficient to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes and is likely a prerequisite to congenital cytomegalovirus\ninfection. The placenta is resistant to viral infection in part due to the antiviral activity of trophoblasts. These\nfetal-derived cells form the physical barrier that separates maternal and fetal circulation and secrete a variety\nof factors, including type III interferon, exosomes, and antimicrobial peptides, that collectively defend the\nmaternal-fetal interface from infection. However, HCMV can replicate in trophoblasts and may injure the\nplacenta either by directly infecting and killing trophoblasts or by stimulating an injurious maternal or fetal\nimmune response. Two preliminary studies have led us to hypothesize that trophoblast differentiation\nsensitizes the placenta to infection-associated injury late in gestation. Firstly, we have found that human\ntrophoblast stem cells (TSCs) can be infected by HCMV but are not permissive to replication. Transcriptome\nprofiling revealed that, like other embryonic and multipotent stem cells, TSCs constitutively express a subset of\ninterferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Suspecting that one or more of these factors protect TSCs and their\nderivatives from HCMV during early differentiation, we will conduct an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 screen to\nidentify HCMV restriction factors in these cells. Follow up studies will use targeted mutagenesis to study how\nISG deletion affects the sensitivity of TSCs, TSC-derived trophoblasts, and trophoblast organoids to infection.\nSeparately, studies in a guinea pig model of congenital cytomegalovirus infection revealed that maternal\ninfection after mid-gestation causes a unique pattern of viral infection in the placenta and a transcriptional\nresponse that implicates placental immunopathology as a cause of stillbirth and fetal growth restriction.\nInfection at an earlier time point had no apparent ill effect on the guinea pig placenta. Thus, we will complete a\nlongitudinal study that examines the effect of maternal cytomegalovirus infection at three different times--\npre/peri-implantation, at the end of the embryonic period, and after mid-gestation--on placental development\nand function. To complement traditional assays of viral load and placental histopathology, we will use spatial\ntranscriptomics to longitudinally study gene expression in the guinea pig placenta at an unprecedented\nresolution and elucidate how infection affects the distinct regions of the placenta. Collectively, these studies will\nreveal how placental susceptibility to viral infection varies across gestation and identify targets for therapeutic\ninterventions that are designed to prevent infection-associated adverse fetal outcomes.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nMany types of resident leukocytes live within the tissues of the body, acting as frontline defenders against\ninfection as well as fulfilling homeostatic tissue support roles. Tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) are poised\nto respond to antigen-specific and non-specific signals at sites of tissue injury. Extracellular adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) are evolutionary conserved \u201cdanger signals\u201d\nreleased by cell damage. In mice and humans, extracellular ATP (eATP) is recognized by purinergic receptors.\nAmong those receptors, P2RX7 is a cell membrane channel preferentially expressed in immune cells that can\nsupport T cell activation along with the development and maintenance of memory T cell subsets at physiologic\nlevels of eATP. However, P2RX7 activity is finely balanced: too little activity discourages memory cell\nhomeostasis whereas persistent, strong activation culminates in cell death via formation of a non-specific pore\nstructure. In mice, ARTC2.2 covalently modifies P2RX7 in response to extracellular NAD+ (eNAD+), amplifying\nthe sensitivity of P2RX7 eATP and encouraging its pro-apoptotic capacities. Previous work has suggested\nARTC2.2 and P2RX7 function to limit inappropriate T cell activation at sites of tissue injury, perhaps curtailing\ndevelopment of harmful immune responses that would produce tissue damage in turn. However, autonomous,\ncell-intrinsic effects of ARTC2.2 upon TRM are poorly defined. Utilizing a newly-generated, germline knockout\nmouse strain deficient in ARTC2.2, this proposal aims to (1) characterize the cell-intrinsic contribution of\nARTC2.2 to CD8+ TRM homeostasis in primary immune responses and (2) assess ARTC2.2 effects upon TRM in\nthe setting of tissue injury incurred by sterile inflammation and secondary infection. Using murine models of\nprimary, secondary, and bystander immune responses, multi-parameter spectral flow cytometry and advanced,\nhigh-resolution quantitative microscopy will identify and enumerate memory CD8+ T cell subsets from lymphoid\nand non-lymphoid tissues. As release of eNAD+ and eATP can occur during processing of experimental tissue,\nthese studies purport to surmount technical challenges inherent to investigation of tissue-resident T cells.\nUltimately, these studies will help elucidate the role of ARTC2.2 in memory CD8+ T cell homeostasis and will\nprovide key insights on how \u201cdanger signals\u201d and the sensing of cellular damage help build long-term immunity\nagainst pathogens and limit deleterious immune activation following tissue injury.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSenescent cells (SnCs) play a causal role in aging and numerous age-related diseases. However, they also\ncontribute to beneficial biology such as wound healing and tissue remodeling. Both physiological and\npathological roles are linked to the secretome of SnCs and their complex interaction with the immune system,\nwhich is thought to play an important role in clearing SnCs. Much of what has been learned about SnCs is derived\nfrom studies in mice, where it has been clearly demonstrated that genetic or pharmacologic removal of SnCs in\naged or diseased organisms reduces frailty; improves strength, endurance, and resilience; and attenuates a\nvariety of age-related diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s. Discovering pharmacologic approaches to remove\ndisease-causing SnCs in humans could have a tremendous impact on our aging population. However, much\nneeds to be learned about SnCs to deploy such approaches safely and effectively in humans. This project aims\nto establish a Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) across multiple institutions with demonstrated expertise in SnCs\nand cell mapping to achieve a common goal; construction of a 4D atlas of SnCs in mouse tissues. The Midwest\nMurine-TMC (MM-TMC) proposes to focus on 5 key tissues: mouse liver, adipose, lung, muscle, and brain. This\nselection is based on MM-TMC\u2019s expertise in the biology, cell biology, and immunology of these organs; lengthy\nexperience studying SnCs in these organs; and applying single cell and spatial technologies to study these\norgans. The MM-TMC and its Administrative Core will be led by PIs with complementary expertise in organ\nbiology and senescence. The Biological Analysis Core will be led by three MPIs who have a long history of\ncollaboration around studying SnCs in aged mice and working with unique and innovative transgenic animals\nthat enable the production or ablation of lineage-specific SnCs. The Data Analysis Core will be led by two\nbioinformaticians with expertise in single cell analysis, cell mapping, and multiplexing complex and disparate\ndata sets to deeply phenotype cells. Other key personnel add expertise in pathology, imaging, spatial mapping\nof SnCs, tissue clearing, transgenic mice, and development of senolytics and immunotherapies to target SnCs.\nA unique feature of the proposed MM-TMC is that the data collection will be done within existing cores largely at\nthe University of Minnesota by staff with expertise in state-of-the art spatial mapping platforms. This provides\nstability in the analytical pipeline and in-place quality control and assurance mechanisms. Through systematic\nand methodical study of SnCs in mouse tissues, the MM-TMC will make significant contributions informing and\nvalidating the SenNet human atlas and will work closely with NIH, other TMCs, Technology Development\nawardees, and the Consortium Organization and Data Coordinating Center to develop and adhere to standards\ncreated by SenNet to accelerate the production of rigorous SnC tissue maps in both species.",

    "abstract_text": "ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT GRANT SUMMARY\nThe Midwest Murine Tissue Mapping Center (MM-TMC) is focused on identifying, characterizing and spatially\nmapping senescent cells (SnCs) in 5 different murine tissues \u2013 adipose, brain, liver, lung and muscle\u2013 from two\ndifferent mouse strains (C57BL/6J and FVB;C57BL/6J F1 mice) with age. To accomplish this, the MM-TMC\nproposed in the parent application to use sc/snRNAseq analysis for identification and characterization of SnCs\nat the transcriptional level and IHC/IF at the protein level and 10X Visium Spatial Gene Expression (SGE) and\nNanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) for the initial spatial transcriptomic analysis along with a ~600\nantibodies for analysis of the proteome. However, neither of these spatial transcriptomics platforms provides\nsingle cell resolution. Low-abundance transcripts (~1.8 transcripts/cell) can be identified when a minimum of\n~300 cells are spatially profiled, and high abundance transcripts can be identified in as few as ~50 cells. Thus,\nwe recently expanded our spatial mapping efforts to our new CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager with the currently\navailable CosMx Universal Cell Characterization RNA and Neuroscience panels that allow for the profiling of the\nexpression of 1000 curated RNA targets with subcellular resolution. CosMx, like GeoMx, is compatible with a\nwide range of tissues, including FFPE. However, even though the 1000-plex CosMx panel can be customized\nby adding up to 50 RNA targets to the panel, the transcriptional profiling is still incomplete, especially when\nusing the panel for analysis of SnCs in a wide spectrum of tissues including brain, adipose, liver, muscle and\nlung. Thus, as part of this Administrative Supplement, we propose to apply the CosMx Whole Transcriptome\nMouse Panel to enable the detection and quantification of over 18,000 RNA transcripts at single-cell and\nsubcellular resolution. Importantly, the MM-TMC has early access to the Mouse Whole Transcriptome Panel in\nthe late Fall of this year that can be pre-ordered at a reduced cost. This unique early access from Bruker will\nallow for completion of the proposed whole transcriptome spatial analysis in the 1 year time frame of the\nsupplement. The use of the CosMx Whole Transcriptome Mouse Panel will allow for greater identification and\ncharacterization of SnCs as well as their paracrine effects on surrounding cells. The analysis also will allow for\ndetermination of changes in cell identities or cell population alterations that correlate with age. Finally, the whole\ntranscriptome analysis will allow for a more detailed characterization of the paracrine signaling in regard to\nligands and their receptors between SnC and their SASP with neighboring cells. It is also important to note that\nthe results from the CosMx Whole Transcriptome Mouse Panel also will be compared to other platforms being\nused by the MM-TMC (e.g., Visium, Visium HD, Xenium, GeoMx, and the 1000 RNA CosMx panel) in regard to\nnot only identifying, characterizing and spatially mapping of SnCs, but also for the characterization of the\nparacrine effects of SnCs on neighboring cells.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nSenescent cells (SnCs) accumulate with age and contribute to driving morbidity and mortality in model systems.\nSnCs also play a role in normal physiology \u2013 for example, wound healing. It is currently unclear when and where\nSnCs arise in tissues as we age, how heterogenous SnCs are in vivo, and how to best identify them, especially\nin humans. The overall goal of the Minnesota Tissue Mapping Center (MN TMC) Biological Analysis Core (BAC)\nis to validate, optimize, and apply state-of-the-art methods for bulk and single cell characterization and spatio-\ntemporal analysis of SnCs in healthy human tissues over a range of ages. The MN BAC will focus on adipose,\nskeletal muscle, liver, and ovarian tissues from healthy humans, which will be provided by the Biospecimen Core\n(BSP). The analytical data generated by the BAC will be delivered to the Data Analysis Core (DAC) via a web\nportal for integration with health data to develop 4D SnC tissue atlases and, eventually, models/predictions of\nSnC health impact. The BAC will be co-directed by Paul Robbins, an expert in characterizing SnCs and in the\ndevelopment of senolytics, and Andrew Nelson, a board-certified anatomic and molecular pathologist with\nextensive experience in bulk and single cell analysis of human tissue. The BAC analytical workflow will be based\nentirely within existing cores and institutes at UMN to guarantee stable infrastructure and high quality control\nstandards: the University Imaging Centers (directed by Mark Sanders), the UMN Genomics Center (directed by\nKenny Beckman), the Center for Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics (CMSP, directed by Tim Griffin) and\nmultiple labs at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota (coordinated by Nathan LeBrasseur). State-of-the-art technologies to\nbe applied to mapping SnCs include digital droplet PCR, single cell and single nucleus RNAseq, tissue clearing,\nRNAScope, CyTOF, IonPath Multiplexed Ion Beam Mass Imaging, Visium Spatial Gene Expression, and\nNanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling. In addition, the CMSP will use a proteogenomic approach to identify\nnovel SnC-specific protein sequences as biomarkers. The BAC will also model early and deep senescence in\nvitro using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, granulosa\ncells, and myogenic and adipocyte progenitors. These cells will be induced to undergo senescence by a variety\nof stressors to validate SnC probes, identify new SnC biomarkers, and characterize the evolution of senescence\nover time. Broadly, the BAC proposes to: 1) Establish a pipeline of reproducible, validated, and quantitative\nassays to detect and characterize SnCs in bulk tissues and single cell preparations; 2) Use iPSC-derived\ndifferentiated cells of multi-lineages as a controlled model for validating analytical tools and expanding the\nrepertoire of SnC biomarkers; 3) Scale-up the data generation pipeline and incorporate emerging technologies;\nand 4) Perform spatiotemporal analysis of SnCs in the four tissues in order for the DAC to generate a 4D atlas\nof SnCs.",

Leveraging cutting-edge techniques like cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) and a\nfunctional nucleotide excision repair (NER) assay, we will assist researchers in studying aging-related DNA\ndamage dynamics. These approaches have been validated in our Core and are unique strengths of the Institute\non the Biology of Aging and Metabolism at the University of Minnesota. The Core will help researchers use\nCyTOF and NER approaches to investigate DNA damage, DDR, senescence, and DNA repair activity during\naging. Our focus on these approaches makes our Core unique as CyTOF and NER approaches are not available\nat any other Nathan Shock Center. The Specific Aims of Core D are to provide a quality-controlled platform and\ncustom reagents for the assessment of DNA damage and repair-associated proteins by CyTOF (Aim 1) and\nprovide a platform to functionally assess NER capacity for aging studies (Aim 2). This Core will provide\nconsistent and validated state-of-the-art approaches to investigate DNA damage and repair that are unique\namong all Nathan Shock Centers. Our assays will build the foundation on which additional functional DNA repair\nassays (e.g., base excision repair, DNA double-strand break repair, DNA inter-strand crosslink repair) can be\nused in aging studies. As the study of DNA damage and how damage may be restored has clinical implications\nin aging research, our Core will provide robust approaches for their assessment.",

    "abstract_text": "Genome instability, a primary hallmark of aging, is defined as DNA damage driven by exogenous genotoxin\nexposure or endogenous events (genotoxins produced through normal metabolic processes, oxidation, and\nhydrolysis), DNA replication errors (point mutations, insertions and deletions, base mismatches that are not\ncorrected), errors in chromosome segregation, and activation of transposable elements. These events can occur\nanywhere in the genome including in telomeric DNA. Genotoxic stress chronically activates the DNA damage\nresponse (DDR), which drives cell fate decisions such as cellular senescence or apoptosis, both of which lead\nto attrition of functional parenchymal and stem/progenitor cells, with the former also driving chronic sterile\ninflammation. Alternatively, changes to the genomic sequence may contribute to aging by driving loss of\nexpression of key gene products or producing transcriptional noise through epigenetic changes. Therefore, it is\nvaluable to the field of aging biology to rigorously determine not only the extent of DNA damage with age, but\nalso to evaluate other hallmarks of aging that are linked to genome instability that are more tractable to\nintervention. Core E has amassed a unique and large collection of human samples and murine models (and a\ntissue bank from the mice) in which there is a DNA repair defect. These models enable the analysis of the\nmolecular, cellular, and organismal impact of spontaneous, endogenous DNA damage. These models are also\nhypersensitive to exogenous genotoxins, enabling the study of environmental or iatrogenic factors that contribute\nto normal or accelerated aging. Thus, the overall goal of this Models of Genome Instability and Aging Core E\nis to make these models available to the broader aging research community for careful examination of how\ngenome instability is linked to other hallmarks of aging that are more amenable to geroscience strategies. We\npropose to provide access to primary and immortalized cells from human subjects with well-established genome\ninstability disorders; provide access to mice, tissues, and primary cells from mice with well-established defects\nin genome maintenance including live mice for specific tissue collections or intervention studies; and generate\nnovel mouse models and human cells to interrogate the impact of genome instability on other hallmarks of aging.\nThe pre-existing resources in Core E have already supported the research of dozens of internal and external\nlaboratories. Overall, Core E will provide and create biospecimens that dovetail seamlessly with workflows in\nthe other MN NSC Research Resource Cores to measure DNA damage and repair, DDR, and epigenetic\nchanges. We also have the expertise to prepare samples for sc/snRNAseq and spatial proteogenomics. Thus,\nthis Core represents a novel resource to the field of aging biology to interrogate the mechanism behind how\ngenome instability, a primary hallmark of aging, drives aging and disease, and is distinct but complementary to\nresources provided by existing NSCs.",

    "abstract_text": "Senescent cells (SnCs) increase in tissues with age and are established to play a causal role in aging and age-\nrelated conditions/syndromes. SnCs confer their adverse effects, at least in part, through their senescence-\nassociated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is pro-inflammatory. A particularly debilitating, deadly, and costly\ncondition that plagues the elderly is susceptibility to severe morbidity and mortality upon infection. The recent\nSARS-CoV-2 pandemic illuminated this problem dramatically. Why are older COVID-19 patients at higher risk\n(>350X) of cytokine storm, multi-organ failure and death upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared to younger\nindividuals? Similarly, why are the elderly more susceptible to progression to sepsis and acute respiratory\ndistress syndrome upon infection? We hypothesize it is because of the increased SnC burden in the elderly with\ntheir inflammatory SASP that drives chronic sterile inflammation and dysregulates the innate and adaptive\nimmune responses of older individuals with infection. We developed a novel experimental paradigm in which to\ntest this hypothesis called normal microbial experience (NME). Specified pathogen-free (SPF) mice are exposed\nto pet store as a model of \u201ccommunity acquired infections.\u201d The pet store mice carry mouse hepatitis virus (MHV),\na \u00df-coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Young SPF survive NME, but old mice experience 100%\nmortality within two weeks. This is due to an increased inflammatory response in old mice compared to young\nupon NME exposure. Pharmacologic or genetic approaches to clear SnCs after NME reduced mortality of old\nmice by 50% and improved adaptive immunity against MHV. We found that in vitro and in vivo, SnCs hyper-\nrespond to challenge with pathogen-associated molecular patterns compared to healthy cells, leading to\nincreased expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Additionally, we found that senescent immune cells\nare particularly deleterious and able to drive secondary senescence and tissue damage through both gain-of\nfunction and loss-of function mechanisms. While provocative, there remains large gaps in knowledge, which if\naddressed offer completely novel approaches to improving immune function and preventing severe infections\nin the elderly. Here, we propose to identify the senescent immune and other SnC type(s) that impede resilience\nto pathogens in old mice and the mechanism(s) involved. To prove cause and effect and move towards\ntranslation, we propose in this Project to identify the key SnCs as possible therapeutic targets and optimize\nsenotherapeutic drugs to improve the immune response in aged mice. To address the role of SnCs in driving\nimmune dysfunction, the Specific Aims of Project 1 are: 1) To identify the SnCs that drive adverse outcomes and\nimmune dysfunction upon exposure of aged mice to environmental microbes, viral infection, or LPS; 2) To\ndetermine if removal of SnCs is sufficient to prevent mortality and improve immune function upon exposure of\nmice to environmental pathogens, viral infection, or LPS; and 3) To optimize senotherapeutic strategies to\nimprove the immune response of aged mice.",

However, one major\nobstacle faced by the consortium is the uncertainty surrounding the ability of the various technologies being\nemployed to robustly characterize senescent cells in different tissues. To address this challenge, the SenNet\nconsortium will undertake a collaborative effort to test the effectiveness of various spatial omics technologies on\nthe same human tissue across different sites, as well as to test their effectiveness across different tissues. This\nendeavor aims to accomplish several goals: firstly, to determine the robustness of senescence-associated\nmarker detection based on the platform, secondly, to extract diverse information about senescence from the\nsame tissue. This consortium-wide benchmarking project will focus on spatial omics techniques that offer single-\ncell resolution. This approach is based on the current understanding that senescent cells are present in relatively\nlow abundance in aged tissues and the need to use technologies that can accurately detect individual senescent\ncells and differentiate them from surrounding cells. By rigorously testing the robustness of high-plex technologies\nalready in use within the SenNet Consortium across multiple sites and tissues, we will determine which\ntechniques are most accurate and informative in detecting senescent cells in different tissues.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY\u2013 DNA DAMAGE AND EPIGENETIC CHANGES CORE C Tretyakova and Villalta\nThe decline of organismal functions seen in the aging process is linked to specific genome instability, a primary\nhallmark of aging. Genome instability, in particular, DNA damage is recognized as a key event in driving not\nonly cellular senescence, but also changes to the epigenome that are associated with aging. Although both\nendogenous and exogenous factors elicit DNA damage, of the sources of genome instability, spontaneous,\nendogenous DNA damage, arising as a consequence of normal physiologic processes, is by far and away the\nmost common event, estimated to occur at a rate of ~40,000 events per cell per day. If not repaired, this DNA\ndamage can drive a DNA damage response (DDR) that results in epigenetic changes, senescence with its\ninflammatory SASP and changes in other hallmarks of aging. Thus, the ability to characterize the diverse types\nof DNA adducts and epimutations involved in the aging process provides opportunities for the development of\nnovel biomarkers of aging and allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies to delay aging and\nextend the health span. The MN NSC DNA Damage and Epigenetics Core C will offer a range of assays to\nquantify endogenous DNA damage, characterize the adductome, and detect epigenetic alterations in DNA\nincluding methylation and hydroxymethylation. Core C also will help identify novel DNA damage and epigenetic\nbiomarkers of aging that then can assist biology of aging investigators. Specifically, Core C will provide\nquantitation of established age-related adduct-specific DNA damage including 8-oxo-dG, O6-methyl-dG, cyclo-\ndA, cyclo-dG, \u0510dC, \u0510dG, \u0510dA, CM-dG, hydroxymethyl-dC, formyl-dC, HNE-dG and Thy-Tyr DNA-protein cross-\nlinks; perform DNA adductomic analysis to identify new DNA adduct biomarkers of aging; develop and validate\nnew assays for age-related DNA adducts; characterize aging associated epigenetic changes, in particular,\nglobal DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation by LC-MS/MS and the distribution of DNA marks using Illumina\nEpic 850 DNA methylation array; and identify new epigenetic biomarkers of aging such as the novel epigenetic\nDNA mark N6-methyladenine. Core C is co-directed by Natalia Tretyakova, an expert in analysis of DNA adducts\nand epigenetic changes, and Peter Villalta, an expert in the analysis of DNA damage by mass spectrometry.\nImportantly, the Core will leverage existing operational UMN cores including the Analytical Biochemistry Shared\nResource of the Masonic Cancer Center and the University of Minnesota Genomics Center. The Core also will\nprovide training opportunities to young investigators and junior faculty on methodologies for analysis of DNA\ndamage and the epigenome. Finally, Core C will work with the other two research cores to characterize genome\ninstability and the DDR with aging in model systems including mice.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nAbout 11-24% of smokers will develop lung tumors over their lifetime, with a greater cancer incidence in\nAfrican American and Native Hawaiian cigarette smokers as compared with Whites, Japanese Americans, and\nLatinos. These differences persist even after adjusting for smoking amounts. Cigarette smoke is a complex\nmixture of chemicals including at least 70 known carcinogens, procarcinogens, and inflammatory agents.\nSmokers belonging to different ethnic groups may have variable responses towards cigarette smoke due to\ninherent genetic and epigenetic differences and ethnicity-related lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, alcohol\nconsumption, and environmental exposures. These factors can lead to differing amounts of DNA and protein\nadducts in smokers, mediating their sensitivity to smoking-induced mutations and cancer. Recent development\nin analytical methodologies and bioinformatics have made it possible to characterize the totality of human\nexposures from both external and internal sources (the exposome) using untargeted or multifaceted analyses\nof hemoglobin adducts. Hemoglobin is the most abundant protein in human blood with a relatively long half-life,\nand hemoglobin adducts reflect cumulative exposures to electrophiles. The adductomics approach is\nanalogous to other -omics methodologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, which are\nmaking it possible to understand and view complex human diseases such as cancer from a global perspective.\nAdductomics studies in smokers will capture individual physiological responses to smoking, potentially\nuncovering new factors that contribute to lung cancer risk.\nWe hypothesize that due to genetic differences and ethnic variations in diet, lifestyle, and environmental\nexposures, human populations of different ethnicity/race form variable numbers of protein and DNA adducts,\nwhich contributes to ethnic disparities in lung cancer risk following exposure to tobacco smoke. The objective\nof this application is to characterize the exposomes of smokers, former smokers, and never smokers, to\ninvestigate inter-individual and inter-ethnic/racial differences in formation of hemoglobin adducts in African\nAmerican, Native Hawaiian, White, Japanese American, and Latino smokers from the Multiethic Cohort (MEC),\nand to establish the role of the exposome in modifying lung cancer risk. Our approach is innovative because\nwe will, for the first time, characterize the totality of external and internal exposures using hemoglobin\nadductomics in a large multiethnic group of smokers.\nExpected outcomes: Our studies will help provide insight into the origins of ethnic variability in sensitivity to\nsmoking-mediated lung cancer and help identify specific risk factors that play the greatest role in modifying\nlung cancer risk. An increased understanding of such risk factors may lead to preventative strategies that will\nhelp overcome ethnic/racial disparities in lung cancer risk and improve human health.",

    "abstract_text": "Sepsis is defined as organ dysfunction resulting from dysregulated host response and is a both a leading\ncause of global mortality and the most expensive hospital treated condition. Gram-negative species underly\nabout half of all bloodstream infections, thus bacteremia pathology is critical to understand. K. pneumoniae\n(Kp) is the second leading cause of Gram-negative bacteremia and a leading cause of health-care associated\ninfections. The pathogenesis of Gram-negative bacteremia involves three phases: 1) initial site infection, 2)\ndissemination to the bloodstream, and 3) survival in blood filtering organs. Kp fitness in the lung, a common\ninitial site of infection, has been studied but last phase of Kp-bacteremia is largely unexplored. There is a\nfundamental gap in our understanding of how Kp perpetuates infection in the blood and filtering organs.\nMacrophages have differing interactions with Kp across organs that correlates to overall Kp abundance within\ntissues during infection. However, the relationship between macrophages and Kp is poorly understood. The\nobjective of this proposal is to define mechanisms of Kp restriction across distinct macrophage subsets\nrelevant to bacteremia. The central hypothesis is that tissue-resident macrophages provide distinct niches that\nrestrict or permit Kp in a manner dependent on bacterial initiation of cell death. I will test this hypothesis\nthrough three specific aims: 1) define splenic macrophage restriction of Kp during bacteremia, 2) define host\npathways of Kp restriction by macrophages, and 3) discover Kp mechanisms of resistance to macrophage-\nmediated killing through initiation of cell death pathways. This work is innovative as it will harness CRISPR-\ngenomic screening to study Kp pathogenesis and use existing transposon sequencing data to identify bacterial\nfactors that are required for resistance to macrophage killing. Findings from these approaches will be applied\nto splenic macrophages, an immune cell subset rarely studied in Gram-negative disease. The research in this\nproposal will support sustained positive impact through identifying both host and pathogen factors required for\nunique tissue-specific responses across sites in bacteremia. This proposal is supported by a comprehensive\ntraining plan which will support the development of technical and conceptual skills to investigate host-pathogen\ninteractions across tissue-resident immune cells during Gram-negative bacteremia. The skills gained with this\ntraining plan could be applied to multiple organ sites and Gram-negative pathogens. This training will occur at\nthe University of Michigan with a team of mentors dedicated to the success of this proposal. The candidate's\nbackground in innate immunology and bacteriology will be unified by mentors with expertise in host-pathogen\ninteractions, macrophage biology, CRISPR-genomics, bacterial genetics, and spleen biology. Together, the\nexpertise of the mentors and the research in this proposal will facilitate independence of the candidate. This\nresearch will reveal tissue-specific interactions between macrophages and Kp during bacteremia.",

This research will address gaps in both the content and ontological representation\nof mental, behavioral, and social constructs. Ontologic representations are formal, explicit, computer-readable\ndefinitions of the meaning of entities and occurrences in some domain. This research seeks to develop, build,\nand evaluate high quality, machine-readable semantic models for mental, behavioral, and social processes,\nfindings (signs, symptoms, exposures, disorders), assessment instruments, and interventions. Focusing on two\nhighly important and diverse diagnostic constructs as test cases, borderline personality disorder (BPD) and\npsychosis, the proposed work will cover a broad and representative sample of clinical constructs, processes,\nfindings, assessment instruments, and interventions that can be applied to many mental health conditions.\nData sources include electronic health records, publication metadata, narrative text in published, peer\nreviewed research, existing terminologies and ontologies, and mental health subject matter experts, including\npatients and families. Qualitative methods, including focus groups, the Nominal Group Technique (NGT), and\nDelphi Method will be used to reach consensus about relevant concepts (clinical ideas), terms (clinical labels),\ndefinitions, and relationships. Methods and Materials include ontology development methods and software\nwhich will be used to physically build machine-readable ontologic models and terms. Models, terms, and\ndefinitions created will be evaluated by domain experts, and shared with publishers of widely adopted national\nand international clinical terminologies.\nThe career development plan will focus on acquiring knowledge and skills in formal terminology development\nmethods, qualitative methods, ontology definition languages, as well as conceptual models of both normative\nand pathological mental functioning and psychological assessment methods. By creating ontologic models\ncapable of fully expressing the meaning of, and relationships among, mental, behavioral, and social constructs,\nthis project will create a foundation upon which additional clinical findings, disorders, assessments, and\ninterventions for mental, behavioral, and social constructs can be built. The substantial number of terms,\nconcepts, definitions, and relationships created through this study will be published and made available to\nresearchers, clinicians, and health systems for use in knowledge discovery and translation paradigms. This\nwork directly addresses the strategic goal of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to develop new\nmethods and tools to accelerate discovery and translation of new knowledge in behavioral science.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAdolescents who live in rural communities have significantly higher rates of depression, suicide, and mental\nhealth impairment than urban youth. They are also less likely to receive mental health care due to provider\nshortages and under-utilization of existing services. Our team is working to expand access to evidence-based\npractices (EBPs) in rural communities by \u201ctask-shifting\u201d delivery from professional providers to youth mentors.\nYouth mentoring programs are low-cost and often viewed as more favorable in rural communities than\nprofessional mental health care. With input from rural youth, parents, and school partners who identified a\nneed for mental health programming that supports interpersonal relationships, we adapted Interpersonal\nPsychotherapy\u2013Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST), an evidence-based depression prevention program, for\ndelivery by mentors of rural youth in an after-school setting. Our work is building on evidence from other task-\nshifting initiatives that demonstrates that paraprofessionals can be trained to deliver EBPs. The training\nprocess for paraprofessionals has typically involved multi-day expert-led workshops that are resource- and\ntime-intensive. The high turnover rate among paraprofessionals can necessitate the need for additional\nworkshops, further exacerbating resource strain. In addition, workshops are delivered weeks or months before\nthe skills are needed, thereby limiting knowledge retention. The next step for realizing the potential of task-\nshifting EBP delivery for reducing mental health disparities is to develop implementation strategies that can be\neffective, sustainable, and scalable in low-resource settings with high provider turnover and non-expert\nsupervisors. Just-in-Time Training (JITT) is one promising approach in which providers receive only the\ntraining necessary, at the time that it is necessary, to produce high program fidelity. We have developed a\nnovel multi-level JITT implementation strategy (JITT-EBP) that aims to equip mentors and mentor supervisors\nto implement an EBP with fidelity using methods that are sustainable in rural communities. JITT-EBP\nintegrates (a) self-directed, on-demand, online training modules for mentors and mentor supervisors, (b)\nsynchronous evidence-based supervision strategies, and (c) an apprenticeship delivery model in which EBPs\nare co-led by an experienced mentor and a novice mentor, providing opportunity for in-the-moment training\nand support. Our hypothesis is that the use of JITT-EBP will result in IPT-AST fidelity and youth clinical\noutcomes that are as good as those observed with usual IPT-AST training, but with higher feasibility,\nacceptability, appropriateness, and perceived sustainability in low-resourced rural settings. To prepare for a\nsubsequent fully-powered hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial, in this pilot trial, the aims are to\noptimize the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of JITT-EBP using a sequential mixed method design; and\nconduct a pilot randomized trial of JITT-EBP versus usual IPT-AST training to evaluate the implementation\noutcomes of JITT-EBP and the implementation and clinical outcomes of mentor-delivered IPT-AST.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract/Summary\nBacteria in the oral cavity contribute to human health and disease. Streptococcus mutans is commonly found\nin the oral microbiome and is recognized as a leading cause of caries (cavities). Some infections in the oral\ncavity can also occur after endodontic treatments such as root canals. Millions of patients undergo root canal\nprocedures each year, and root canal failure rates can be as high as ~20%. A leading cause of infected root\ncanals is the Gram-positive bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, which is found at low abundance in the\ngastrointestinal tracts (GIT) of humans, animals, and insects. E. faecalis can also be an opportunistic\npathogen causing infections on implanted devices and in body sites such as the urinary tract, bloodstream, and\nwounds. Despite its prevalence in root canal infections, E. faecalis is not typically considered part of the core\noral microbiome. Our preliminary data shows that natural products (such as non-ribosomal\npeptides/polyketides) synthesized by S. mutans can kill E. faecalis and other Gram-positive bacteria. Through\nthis proposal, we will identify natural products with anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm activity produced by additional\nstrains of S. mutans using a combination of targeted gene deletions, bacterial co-culture assays, and mass\nspectrometry. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that S. mutans biofilms producing these natural products\ncan exclude E. faecalis from invading pre-formed biofilms and can shape biofilm dynamics in conditions\nrelevant to the oral cavity. This work will serve as the foundation for a future R01 to NIDCR to test models of\ncolonization resistance and dysbiosis that may govern E. faecalis dynamics in the oral cavity, and to determine\nhow streptococcal natural products shape the ecology of the oral microbiome.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nLike other drugs of abuse, psychostimulants enhance dopamine (DA) neurotransmission from the ventral\ntegmental area (VTA) to downstream targets including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus\naccumbens (NAc). Direct stimulation of VTA DA neurons in rodents is reinforcing and sufficient to trigger an\narray of molecular, cellular, and behavioral adaptations linked to addiction. Psychostimulants can weaken\ninhibitory G protein-dependent signaling in VTA DA neurons and layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons of the prelimbic\n(PL) sub-region of the mPFC via suppression of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channel activity.\nIn layer 5/6 PL pyramidal neurons, for example, repeated cocaine exposure in mice weakens GIRK channel\nregulation by the GABAB receptor (GABABR) in a DA- and phosphorylation-dependent manner. Genetic\nsuppression of GIRK channel activity in PL pyramidal neurons of drug-na\u00efve mice evokes some of the cellular\nand behavioral hallmarks of repeated cocaine exposure. The goals of this project are to elucidate the cellular\nand neurochemical mechanisms underlying the cocaine-induced suppression of GABABR-GIRK signaling in PL\npyramidal neurons and to investigate the therapeutic potential associated with rescuing this signaling pathway\nin these neurons. Proposed experiments test key elements of the following conceptual framework: Cocaine\nprovokes the D1 DA receptor-dependent excitation of PL GABA neurons, driving the feedforward inhibition of PL\npyramidal neurons. Repeated GABAergic input to PL pyramidal neurons promotes the suppression of the\nGABABR-GIRK signaling pathway. Weakening of this inhibitory signaling pathway contributes to the\nhyperexcitability of PL pyramidal neurons, which promotes aberrant behaviors associated with repeated cocaine\nexposure. Mechanism-informed interventions that restore or strengthen the GABABR-GIRK signaling pathway in\nPL pyramidal neurons, therefore, will normalize behaviors linked to repeated cocaine exposure. There are two\nSpecific Aims: 1) Elucidate mechanisms underlying the cocaine-induced hyperexcitability of PL pyramidal\nneurons. Using slice electrophysiological approaches, I will test the hypothesis that D1R activation of PL GABA\nneurons drives the feedforward inhibition of PL pyramidal neurons necessary for the cocaine-induced\nsuppression of GABABR-GIRK signaling. 2) Test whether mechanism-informed interventions can rescue\ncocaine-induced behavioral deficits. Using complementary pharmacological and neuron-specific viral genetic\ninterventions, I will test the hypothesis that mechanism-informed interventions that rescue and/or strengthen\nGABABR-GIRK signaling in PL pyramidal neurons can alleviate behavioral deficits provoked by repeated cocaine\nexposure in mice. Successful completion of this project will advance our understanding of the mechanisms and\nrelevance of cocaine-induced suppression of GABABR-GIRK signaling in PL pyramidal neurons, and provide\nvaluable training in ex vivo electrophysiology, intracranial genetic and pharmacological manipulations, and\nbehavioral analysis in mice, building a strong foundation for my future career as an independent investigator.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nAs the major organ responsible for olfaction and air intake, and thanks to its rich connections to the autonomic\nnervous system, the nose plays many pivotal roles for survival. In fact, disruptions in olfaction and autonomic\nfunction are often observed before loss of brain function ensues during the progression of neurodegenerative\ndiseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As such, the nose is being increasingly\nrecognized as a critical investigational target for understanding the complex functional interactions between\nperipheral and central nervous system, identifying mechanisms of action of disease, and even for delivery of\ntherapeutic interventions. Yet, the characterization of system-wide functional connections between the nose and\nthe central nervous system is challenged by the lack of neuroimaging methods which detect robust surrogates\nof functional activity in the nose. In fact, whereas standard functional MRI techniques are formidable tools for\ncharacterizing function in the brain, they are intrinsically inadequate for detecting functional signals in the nose,\nbecause the susceptibility artefacts originating from the air-tissue interfaces of the nasal cavity destroy magnetic\nfield uniformity and lead to signal loss with standard fMRI techniques that rely on the use of an echo time (TE).\n To overcome the challenges of nose fMRI, in this project we will exploit the resilience to susceptibility\nartefacts offered by ultrashort/zero-TE acquisition schemes, which we previously demonstrated being capable\nof providing robust fMRI contrast primarily mediated by blood flow. Our pilot data demonstrate that\nunprecedented fMRI signals during both tasks and resting state can be detected with ultrashort TE (UTE)\ntechniques in the human nasal cavity. Therefore, our plan here is to first optimize these innovative UTE protocols\nfor fMRI of the human nose, and to apply them in cross-sectional and in test-retest studies designed to provide\nsupporting evidence to our overarching hypothesis: UTE enables detection of robust nose fMRI signals primarily\nmediated by blood flow fluctuations that generally correlate with ANS activity and that during the presentation of\nodor stimuli specifically reflect olfactory processing in the nose. Protocol optimizations will be first performed to\nensure maximum coverage, functional contrast, spatial and temporal resolutions on each of two clinical MRI\nplatforms, 7T and 3T. Detection sensitivity and reproducibility of nose fMRI signals and system-wide connections\nbetween nose and the nervous system will be then evaluated on each MRI platform. To determine whether the\nfMRI nose signals reflect olfactory processing, we will deliver different sensory stimuli (odor, visual and odorless\nairflow stimuli); to characterize the dependence of nose fMRI signals on the function of the autonomic nervous\nsystem, we will correlate the nose fMRI signals with other surrogates of autonomic function such as hearth rate\nand breathing rate variabilities. Once completed, this study will have demonstrated the first proof-of-principle use\nof nose fMRI in humans by making use of widely available clinical scanners, thus greatly facilitating translational\napplications and dissemination to a broad community of researchers and clinicians.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nBrain function is critically dependent on the proper relationship of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neuronal\nmetabolic demands, a phenomenon referred to as neurovascular coupling. Pathological reductions in CBF are\ncommonly observed in presence of loss of brain function, but paradoxically there is often sufficient oxygen supply\nto support function. Answering this paradox not only would help understand the loss of brain function, but would\nalso provide important new insights into how to interpret fMRI, which essentially measures neurovascular\ncoupling, at the network down to the microscopic level of brain function. I propose to answer these longstanding\nquestions, via a new approach. Rather than following the decades old path of focusing almost exclusively on\noxygen delivery and its coupling to neuronal activity, I will develop and validate imaging methods and\nmathematical models for studying how neurovascular coupling maintains homeostasis of all of the substrates\nand products of functional brain metabolism. The importance of maintaining tight regulation of the levels of the\nmetabolic products CO:i and protons, have long been recognized via EEG/MEG studies of respiratory hyper and\nhypocarbia; yet CO2 and protons homeostasis are mosUy disregarded, likely because non-invasive\nmethodologies that allow their assessments are lacking. My goal is to fulfill this unmet need, and establish a\ntransformative neuroimaging approach that quantifies non-invasively oxygen availability, pH and carbon dioxide\naccumulation in brain tissue. Achieving this goal requires comprehensive studies and theoretical understanding\nranging from microscopic capillary transport to the regulation of systemic physiology, at the center of this project.\nHere my efforts will pivot to a new direction of unprecedented studies that will combine positron emission\ntomography (PET), optical imaging, MRI, implanted biosensors, and theoretical modeling. My colleagues and I\nhave already conceptualized the highly innovative framework that grounds the studies of this proposal. In\nparticular, by connecting for the first time the properties of neurovascular coupling to the needs of waste removal\noriginating from the metabolic processes linked to neurotransmission, we paved the way towards accurate\ncalculations of oxygen availability, pH and carbon dioxide accumulation from routine MRI measurements. Such\na methodology has a tremendous potential to transform the scope and breadth of basic and clinical investigations\nof the brain (and beyond}, however rigorous validations are sorely needed in order to realize its potential. By\ncapitalizing on recent advances in imaging platforms available at the CMRR and in partner institutions which I\nhave been collaborating with for years, the time is mature to conduct the proposed high-risk, high-impact studies\nthat can only be executed within the flexible scheme of a Pioneer award. Focusing on pathological mechanisms\nlinking loss of brain function to abnormal accumulations of metabolic waste products, and on non-MRI techniques\nfor validation studies, requires a major research shift for me, but is essential for building the foundation of a much\nbroader agenda that will benefit the basic and translational neuroscience community and ultimately patient care.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nAltered cerebrovascular health is strongly associated with aging. PET and MRI studies have found age\ndependent reductions in resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neurovascular coupling (NVC) that correlate with\npoorer cognitive function and higher risk of dementia. Yet paradoxically, brain energy consumption is close to\nnormal. If there is sufficient O2 delivery to support metabolism, how do reduced CBF and neurovascular coupling\nimpact function? Answering this question is critical for interpreting MRI data available via research efforts such\nas the Human Connectome Project on Aging (HCP-A), and for developing novel in vivo MRI metrics of brain\nhealth. To address this question, we recently developed and validated a novel computational Homeostatic\nModeling (HoMod), which integrates for the first time NVC with neurometabolic coupling (NMC) \u2013 i.e., the\nincrease in proton and lactate production from glucose and glycogen metabolism. Using MRI or PET data,\nHoMod allows calculation of regional brain tissue and capillary blood levels of not just fuels (glucose, O2), but\nalso metabolic waste products (pH, CO2, lactate). Extensive behavioral and EEG/MEG studies have found\ncognitive function is highly dependent on homeostasis of these products. Using HoMod we showed for the first\ntime that, in healthy young adults, both resting state CBF and the large increase in NVC during activation, are\ncrucial for maintaining homeostasis of pCO2, pO2, and pH.\n Motivated by these findings, our objective is to use HoMod to test our general hypothesis: reduced resting\nCBF and NVC in the elderly impair brain function via loss of pCO2, pO2, and pH homeostasis. Preliminary findings\nfrom human brain PET and MRI group datasets strongly support this hypothesis, however same subject\nmeasurements of OEF, NVC, and NMC are needed for validation and extension to resting state fluctuations. Our\napproach pursues prospective calibrated fMRI and fMRS studies in young and elderly subjects, and extends and\nfurther validates HoMod, through the following aims. Aim 1: Use HoMod to calculate pCO2, pO2, and pH maps\nin young and elderly subjects from resting awake OEF maps measured with calibrated fMRI at 3T to determine\nif there is loss of homeostasis in elderly subjects. Aim 2: Use fMRS and calibrated fMRI at 7T to determine if\nthere are age associated reductions in NMC and NVC during visual stimulation, and use HoMod to assess impact\non homeostasis. Exploratory Aim: Measure amplitude of calibrated fMRI resting state fluctuations at 3T, calculate\nNVC, and estimate possible age associated homeostasis alterations during fluctuations. Achieving these aims\nis highly impactful for brain aging research and beyond because HoMod is an emerging methodology that allows\nfor the first time assessing whether abnormal NMC and NVC lead to loss of pCO2, pO2, and pH homeostasis.\nSuch an opportunity is potentially critical to determine the impact of homeostasis on brain cognitive health in\naging, as well as to guide potential interventions to improve or preserve brain health in aging and in other\nneurological conditions such as dementia, stroke, traumatic brain injury and cancer.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe prevalence of obesity and diabetes continue to rise unabated in the United States,\ncreating a grave social and economic burden. Although development of these diseases is\nmulti-faceted and complex, there is accumulating evidence for the impact of environmental\nchemical exposures on metabolic homeostasis. Currently, glyphosate is the most commonly\nused herbicide in the United States, however, to date, no studies have ever assessed whether\nglyphosate exposure impacts the development of obesity and diabetes. Thus, the long-term\ngoal of this project is to better understand how recent and current pesticide usage can impact\nlong-term metabolic homeostasis.\n Glyphosate targets the shikimate pathway found in plants, and not mammals, leading\nto the assumption of its general safety. However, glyphosate can also target bacteria, and\nglyphosate exposure results in an altered gut microbiome profile. Despite the fact that\nprevious pesticides are associated with metabolic disease, and that glyphosate is known to\nalter the gut microbiota which can impact energy and glucose homeostasis, no study has ever\nexamined whether exposure to glyphosate can result in development of obesity and/or\ndiabetes. One of the main roles of the gut microbiota is bile acid metabolism, and studies\nsuggest that alterations in bile acid signaling represent a plausible link between the gut\nmicrobiota and regulation of metabolic homeostasis via changes in Farnesoid X receptor\n(FXR) signaling. These facts, coupled with our preliminary data, led to the hypothesis that\nexposure to glyphosate shifts the gut microbiome, leading to altered intestinal bile acid\nsignaling that contributes to impairments in energy and glucose homeostasis. This hypothesis\nwill be tested in 3 aims: 1) assess if exposure to glyphosate during different developmental\ntimepoints promotes metabolic dysfunction in male and female mice on a chow or high-fat diet,\n2) determine the role of the gut microbiome in the effects of glyphosate exposure on metabolic\nhomeostasis, and 3) identify the impact of altered bile acid signaling via glyphosate exposure\nin impaired metabolic homeostasis. The proposed study will be the first ever to provide\nmechanistic insight of the effects of glyphosate exposure on metabolic homeostasis. This\nproposal will provide valuable data leading to further research examining how environmental\npesticide usage can affect human health, and possibly identify microbial targets to offset the\ndetrimental effects of environmental chemical use.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nPatients with high-risk hematological malignancies may be cured using allogeneic hematopoietic cell\ntransplantation (HCT); however, HCT carries a significant risk for mortality. Social adversity accounts for\nincreased risk for morbidity and mortality following HCT in both adults and children. Our group has identified that\nin adult recipients, not only is this risk disproportionately worse among HCT recipients of low socioeconomic\nstatus (SES), but it is worse among recipients receiving hematopoietic cells from donors of low SES. Further,\nwe have demonstrated that up-regulation of a stress- and SES-related transcriptome profile \u2013 termed the\n\u201cconserved transcriptional response to adversity\u201d (CTRA) \u2013 within adult HCT donors and recipients may be a\nbiological contributor to cancer outcomes disparities. However, it is unknown whether low donor SES and\ndonor/recipient stress-related immunobiological factors, such as CTRA expression and biological aging (both\nlinked to poorer outcomes in cancer and HCT patients), pose a prognostic risk to pediatric HCT recipients.\nDespite our novel findings in adults, they cannot be extrapolated to pediatric patients because pediatric patients\nare diagnosed with cancer that is biologically unique from adults and they experience stress and illness differently\nthan adults. The goal of this research is to extend our understanding of whether the immunobiologic mechanisms\nunderlying the comorbidity of social health disparities in adult cancer and HCT extend to the biologically and\npsychosocially unique pediatric cancer population, providing a critical link for designing interventions to reduce\ncancer disparities. The primary aims of this proposal are to: 1) quantify how donor and recipient SES are\nassociated with pediatric HCT outcomes; 2) evaluate how HCT donor and pediatric recipient SES affects biologic\nindicators of stress (CTRA, biological aging); and 3) determine the relationship between donor and recipient\nstress biology factors and clinical outcomes in pediatric HCT patients. Our overarching hypothesis is that SES-\nrelated immunobiologic risk factors will be associated with pediatric recipient and donor SES, and that both will\nbe associated with inferior pediatric HCT outcomes, including disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality,\nrelapse, graft-versus-host disease, and overall survival. The research plan employs molecular biology to\ninvestigate immunobiologic factors underlying health disparities by collaborating with the federally funded Center\nfor International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. We will leverage the expertise of a multidisciplinary\ninvestigator team by using clinical (N=1716 donor/recipient pairs) and biological (N=946 each for donors and\nrecipients) data for donors and recipients in the pediatric HCT population. By identifying SES-related\nimmunobiological risk factors for adverse pediatric HCT outcomes, we have the opportunity to optimize HCT\noutcomes and address potential biological mechanisms of cancer disparities. The proposed work will define the\ngene regulatory understanding of SES disparities in pediatric cancer treatment outcomes, providing critical data\nto design interventions for improving outcomes across the age continuum.",

In this biphasic R61/R33 application, we propose a MDDT, in the form of an accelerated fatigue\ntest calibrated by clinical data, for assessing the clinical performance of resin composites. The method\nexplicitly predicts the survival probability of composite restorations as a function of time, through some\neasy-to-perform cyclic fatigue and biofilm tests on a simple yet clinically representative model composite\nrestoration. Our immediate goal is to have this MDDT qualified by the FDA for use by dental materials\nmanufacturers, while our long-term goal is to extend the method and application of this tool to other\nmedical devices. Our strategy for qualifying the proposed MDDT contains the following specific aims:\nPhase 1, Aim 1 Confirm repeatability of accelerated fatigue test for model resin-composite restorations.\nThe fatigue test using conventional materials will be repeated multiple times. The resulting survival\nprobability curves are expected to lie within the 95% interval of each other.\nPhase 1, Aim 2 Assess viability and repeatability of calibrated biofilm model for producing recurrent\ncaries in debonded specimens. Debonded specimens will be challenged using a clinically-calibrated\nbiofilm model. Recurrent caries is expected to be produced consistently in the specimens and the clinical\ntime for it to occur following debonding can be predicted within the required confidence intervals.\nPhase 2, Aim 3 Determine if laboratory model can accurately predict service life of a wide range of\ncomposite restorations using prospective clinical data. Prospective clinical data for different classes of\nrestorations will be collected for calibration and validation of the laboratory model. The calibrated model\nis expected to be able to accurately predict the clinical performance of different classes of restorations.\nPhase 2, Aim 4 Determine if laboratory model can accurately predict service life of a wide range of\ncomposite restorations using retrospective clinical data.

    "abstract_text": "Health workforce projections for the United States consistently indicate a shortage of well-trained researchers in the fields of epidemiology and prevention. Importantly, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the employment of epidemiologists is projected to grow 26 percent from 2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations. Meeting this surge in demand will require sustained support for training programs across the U.S. This five-year proposal is for renewal of a longstanding training grant in the epidemiology and prevention of cardiovascular disease administered by the Division of Epidemiology & Community Health, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota. The program is highly successful, having graduated 75 postdoctoral and predoctoral fellows since 1977. Among graduates in the past 15 years, 93% are currently in research positions, and 67% have obtained research funding, mostly from NIH. The training program\u2019s excellent facilities, large and diverse faculty, and broad research opportunities offer an outstanding training environment. Our training program has continued to evolve and improve, to offer a cutting-edge training experience in cardiovascular disease epidemiology and prevention.\nIn the most recent period (2019-2024), the program was awarded four predoctoral and three postdoctoral fellowship positions. Positions have been filled throughout and we continue to have outstanding applicants. A total of 14 different faculty have served as a formal mentor for at least one trainee during this same time period, demonstrating the breadth of expertise available to the trainees and the extent of involvement of participating faculty in the delivery of training. Fellows have been highly productive, generating impactful publications and presenting at national and international meetings. Our proposal for renewal (2024-2029) is to maintain seven fellowship positions per year \u2013 three postdoctoral and four predoctoral.\nThe University of Minnesota T32 fellowship program offers outstanding training opportunities in direct research experience combined with a strong curriculum of formal coursework, seminars and expert mentorship. The uniqueness of the training is the commitment of its faculty and the breadth of existing research, from the laboratory to the community. The continued need for qualified cardiovascular epidemiologists and the program\u2019s documented success justify its renewal.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\n Promoting weight-related health is vital to cardiovascular health and a public health priority. The Project\nEAT (Eating and Activity over Time) research has informed a paradigm shift regarding how to address weight-\nrelated health. Specifically, findings have shown the need to address the full spectrum of weight-related health,\nincluding weight status, dietary intake, physical activity, body image, disordered eating (e.g., binge eating,\nunhealthy weight control practices), and eating disorders, in addition to social determinants of these outcomes.\n The socio-environmental contexts of adolescents and young adults today (i.e., those who make up\nGeneration Z born between 1997-2012) have dramatically changed since Project EAT began following\nadolescent Millennials (i.e., those born between 1981-1996) in 1998. For example, there have been vast\nchanges in technology and young people are being exposed to a proliferation of image-based social media\n(e.g., TikTok) with mixed messages about weight-related health (e.g., new weight loss medications, body\npositivity). If we are to effectively promote weight-related health and health equity across ethnicity/race and\nsocio-economic status in the next generation of young people, it is crucial to understand the most salient\nissues facing today\u2019s adolescents and young adults. The ultimate goal of this R35 is to promote the broad\nspectrum of weight-related health in the next generation of adolescents and young adults.\n To achieve this goal, the R35 will integrate research, community partnerships, and training. For the first\ntime, Project EAT will collect data on a national sample of 2000 Gen Z adolescents and young adults.\nAdditionally, we will leverage the existing Project EAT Millennial-generation cohorts by collecting data from both\ncohort members and their Gen Z adolescent and young adult children (expected n=1000 parent-child dyads),\nfor an intergenerational study across two generations of young people. We will also conduct qualitative data\ncollection for a deep understanding of the weight-related issues facing Gen Z young people; rapid response\nsurveys to assess the impact of socio-environmental influences in real time; and innovative substudies for in-\ndepth explorations of timely topics. The result will be the most comprehensive dataset to date on weight-\nrelated health among diverse adolescents, young adults, and their parents. To ensure that our data are used to\nmake a positive difference, we will work in partnership with two Community Advisory Boards; one comprised of\ndiverse adolescents and young adults and the other comprised of professionals (e.g., health care providers).\nWe will also integrate training throughout the research program to ensure that future scientists are prepared to\naddress weight-related health in young people, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds.\n This R35 aligns with the NHLBI Strategic Vision. It will support a highly dedicated and productive\nresearcher, along with a strong team, to carry out a timely, impactful, and innovative program of research and\ntraining to significantly advance science, enhance weight-related health, and work toward greater health equity.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe stereotypic and relatively simple circuitry of the cerebellar cortex, with its highly conserved nature throughout\nevolution makes the cerebellum a very attractive circuit to understand fundamental neuronal mechanisms by\nwhich the brain performs input-output transformations that are needed not only for motor function but a spectrum\nof non-motor functions. A unifying view of the computations performed by the cerebellar cortex that incorporates\nits dominant parasagittal and transverse architectures has proved elusive. Recordings of cerebellar neuronal\nactivity across multiple folia at relatively high spatial and temporal resolution are limited. Further, given the\ncerebellum\u2019s involvement in several motor and non-motor processes, it is crucial to make these recordings in\nfreely behaving mice in which the wide repertoire of behaviors is not impeded. Here, we propose to engineer a\nminiaturized ultra-widefield micro-camera array microscope (MCAM) capable of imaging a large area (24mm2)\nof the cerebellar cortex with cellular resolution. This MCAM combines several innovations, including a\ntransparent polymer window implant for cellular resolution imaging, an array of epi-fluorescence micro-camera\noptics, along with complementary genetic approaches for sparsely labeling Purkinje cell populations in the\ncerebellum. In AIM 1, we will design and build an MCAM to be compatible with a cerebellum polymer skull implant\ndeveloped by our collaborative team. Experiments will be conducted in head fixed mice to refine and optimize\nthe opto-mechanical components of the MCAM. In AIM 2, we will deploy MCAM in freely behaving mice in open\nfield arenas and iteratively refine the design of structural and optical elements to ensure robust motion and light\nartifact free imaging in freely behaving animals. We will then validate the utility of the cerebellum MCAM to\nmeasure cerebellar wide Purkinje cell activities and encoding of error signaling in ladder rung walking.",

In the weeks prior to onset of meningitis, cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) is\ndetectable in the blood, and is a predictor of meningitis and death. CrAg screening in plasma is an effective\npublic health strategy to identify persons with CD4<200 cells/mcL at high risk of meningitis and death. In a\nrandomized trial of 2000 persons with HIV, CrAg screening and preemptive fluconazole treatment yielded a\n28% survival benefit over standard-of-care. As a result, the World Health Organization and U.S. guidelines\nrecommend CrAg screening. Yet despite the survival benefit seen with CrAg screening and preemptive\ntherapy, 25% of initially asymptomatic CrAg+ persons treated with fluconazole still die, even with HIV therapy.\n From 4 prospective cohort studies of CrAg+ persons in Africa, we have determined that as plasma CrAg\ntiter increases, mortality increases, despite fluconazole therapy. Among asymptomatic CrAg+ persons,\ndisseminated cryptococcosis is the most commonly identified cause of death. We posit that subclinical\ndisseminated early neuroinfection in the brain parenchyma accompanies high CrAg titers, and fluconazole is\ninadequate therapy. More effective treatment is critically needed to reduce mortality in CrAg+ persons.\n For symptomatic cryptococcal meningitis, amphotericin B is the most effective antifungal; fluconazole alone\nis inadequate. Recent randomized trial data reported single dose of liposomal amphotericin (AmBisome) 10 mg\n/kg with flucytosine (5FC) and fluconazole is as effective and less toxic than the traditional 7-day amphotericin\n+ 5FC for meningitis. We hypothesize that AmBisome (10mg/kg x1), when combined with fluconazole, will be\nmore effective than fluconazole monotherapy for asymptomatic CrAg+ persons.

We will complete a randomized clinical trial of 600 CrAg+ persons (i.e. 356\nmore participants) to determine if preemptive therapy with AmBisome (10mg/kg x1) plus fluconazole for CrAg+\npersons will improve cryptococcal meningitis-free 6-month survival compared with the current standard of\nfluconazole monotherapy (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will determine if neurocognitive outcomes in CrAg+ persons\npreemptively treated with AmBisome with fluconazole are superior to outcomes with fluconazole monotherapy.\nFinally, in Aim 3 we will evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of AmBisome with fluconazole preemptive\ntreatment in CrAg+ persons.

    "abstract_text": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all people living with HIV (PLWH) \u2013 regardless of their CD4\ncell count \u2013 to improve survival and reduce transmission. This \u201ctreat-all\u201d approach benefits PLWH overall, but\nalso confers a risk of unmasking immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and death, particularly\nfor the 30-40% of people who present with advanced HIV disease (CD4 count <200 cells/\u00b5L) worldwide.\n In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that persons with advanced HIV disease be\nscreened for opportunistic infections (OIs) and given prophylaxis for tuberculosis (TB) and cryptococcal antigen\n(CrAg). However, because this screening and prophylaxis package has never been validated in a clinical trial,\nit is not consistently implemented in sub-Saharan Africa. Compounding the problem, funding for CD4 testing\nhas been reduced by stakeholders as CD4 testing is no longer needed for ART initiation.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nMethamphetamine (meth) addiction is a large and growing public health concern that is inadequately managed\nwith available therapeutics. This proposal addresses this need by furthering our understanding of a promising\nnew anti-addiction therapeutic strategy. Meth induces inappropriate dopamine (DA) release from neurons of the\nmesolimbic DA pathway. Restoration of DA signaling homeostasis may be achieved by targeting the G protein-\ncoupled receptor (GPCR) neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1). NTSR1 modulates DA signaling via action at putative\nNTSR1/D2 DA receptor complexes. The efficacy of peptide NTSR1 agonists in animal models of meth use have\nmade clinically useful, small molecule NTSR1 ligands highly desirable. NTSR1, like other GPCRs, signals\nthrough both G protein- and \u03b2-arrestin-mediated pathways. Recently, we developed and characterized a novel\nclass of small molecule NTSR1 ligands, typified by compound SBI-553, which activate \u03b2-arrestin without\nstimulating G protein signaling. This type of functional selectivity or biased signaling presents an opportunity to\nproduce more directed physiological action and reduce unwanted side effects. Promising data suggests that SBI-\n553 attenuates the reinforcing effects of meth in mice without the hypotension and hypothermia characteristic of\nbalanced NTSR1 ligands. At present, the mechanisms by which \u03b2-arrestin-biased NTSR1 ligands block meth\neffects are unclear and the cell type(s) on which \u03b2-arrestin-biased NTSR1 ligands act on is unknown. The\nobjectives of this application are to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which \u03b2-arrestin-biased NTSR1\nligands achieve \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to the NTSR1 and to identify the cell type(s) in the nucleus accumbens\n(NAc) at which they act to attenuate meth-induced behaviors. My central hypothesis is that is that \u03b2-arrestin-\nbiased NTSR1 ligands stimulate receptor-\u03b2-arrestin association via a G protein-independent, GPCR kinase 2\n(GRK2)-dependent mechanism and attenuate meth-induced behaviors via action on D2-expressing medium\nspiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc core. I will test this hypothesis by pursuing two aims, using SBI-553 as a tool\ncompound. I will first (1) elucidate the biochemical mechanism by which NTSR1 ligands recruit \u03b2-arrestin, using\nrecently developed GRK- and G protein-subtype-specific-null cells. I will then (2) identify the cell type on which\nNTSR1 ligands act in the NAc to attenuate meth addiction-like behaviors, visualizing NTSR1-expressing cells in\nand projecting to the NAc using virally-mediated fluorophore expression and assessing the ability of SBI-553 to\nattenuate meth-induced locomotion and conditioned place preference in mice lacking NTSR1 selectivity in D2\nMSNs. Pursuit of these aims requires interdisciplinary training in molecular biology and systems neuroscience.\nTherefore, I have assembled expert collaborators into an interdisciplinary mentoring committee, led by Drs.\nLauren Slosky (Sponsor) and Kevin Wickman (Co-Sponsor). Together, we have crafted an individualized\ntraining plan that will provide me with the foundational scientific and professional skills necessary to reach my\nlong-term goal of running an independent laboratory and studying the neurobiological basis of addiction.",

To do so, we\nwill compare behavioral tests of visual perception using adaptation in people with VSS versus normally sighted\ncontrol participants, as well as non-invasive measurements of neural activity (functional magnetic resonance\nimaging) and brain chemistry (magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Understanding where and how spontaneous\nneural activity leads to visual snow percepts will pave the way for new treatment strategies, objective tests, and\nbiomarkers for VSS, which may in turn improve quality of life, diagnosis, and evaluation of treatment efficacy in\nthis disorder.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY\n Offspring of mothers with depression are at threefold risk of developing depression themselves, known as\nthe intergenerational transmission of depression (IGTD). Self-regulation (SR) impairments are conceptualized\nas a vulnerability linking maternal and offspring depression. In infancy, SR develops in the context of infant-\ncaregiver interactions requiring both infant and caregiver contributions. However, elevated maternal perinatal\ndepressive symptoms\u2014which affect one in five mothers\u2014may hinder infant SR development. Specifically,\nprenatal symptoms may undermine infant physiological regulation while postnatal symptoms may undermine\nsensitive parenting, both of which are critical for infant-caregiver interactions that support SR. Thus, infants\nexposed to different timing patterns of perinatal depressive symptoms (prenatal, postnatal, or both) may\nexperience different mechanisms of risk (i.e., prenatal symptoms may affect SR through impaired infant\nphysiological regulation while postnatal symptoms may affect SR through reduced sensitive parenting).\nImportantly, these pathways likely interact to produce particularly heightened risk in the case of perinatal\nsymptoms occurring across both the pre- and postnatal periods. The present study uses a leading-edge\nanalytical approach to examine 1) the specific timing effects of prenatal only, postnatal only, or both pre- and\npostnatal depressive symptoms on infant SR and 2) the two potentially interacting pathways linking maternal\nperinatal symptoms to infant SR. In a longitudinal sample of 168 pregnant women, prenatal maternal\ndepressive symptoms are assessed at 34-35 weeks gestation; postnatal maternal depressive symptoms, infant\nautonomic regulation, and maternal sensitivity at 2 months postpartum; and infant SR at 6 months postpartum\nto address my specific aims. With the support of the NRSA fellowship and my mentoring team, I will complete\nthe proposed research and my training goals, which are to 1) integrate my existing knowledge of the perinatal\nand infancy periods and infant SR into models of the IGTD; 2) develop expertise in processing and\ninterpretation of cardiorespiratory indices of autonomic functioning; 3) gain experience in behavioral coding of\ninfant SR; 4) advance my expertise in quasi-experimental approaches for strengthening causal inference by\nintegrating concerns about developmental timing and causal mediation; and 5) engage in professional\ndevelopment and ethics training. By identifying which dyads are most at risk for SR difficulties and how that\nrisk is transmitted, the proposed project will inform targeted prevention and intervention efforts that reduce\ndifficulties in SR during infancy and thus interrupt the IGTD, addressing a clear public health need. The training\nI will receive with the support of this NRSA fellowship will also prepare me to achieve my career goal of\nbecoming a professor at an R1 research institution and continuing to pursue a research program aimed at\nunderstanding and interrupting the IGTD and reducing the substantial burden of depressive symptoms on\nindividuals and our broader society.",

Immunotherapies have ushered in a new age of cancer treatment, harnessing the potency of the immune\nsystem to restrict cancer without many of the side effects of conventional therapies. These immunotherapies\nhave largely targeted T cell responses that are specific for tumor antigens. While immunotherapies leveraging\ntumor-specific T cells have proven powerful tools in combatting cancer, their success if context-dependent,\ndisplaying limited efficacy in many solid tumors. Part of this phenomenon results from tumor-specific T cells\nreceiving chronic T cell receptor (TCR) signaling (caused by recognition of cognate tumor antigens) within the\ntumor micro-environment (TME). Chronic TCR signaling in the TME permanently renders tumor-specific T cells\nfunctionally inert, suggesting a probable limit to which we can exploit these tumor-specific T cells before they are\ntherapeutically unviable. However, T cells are diverse in human tumors, with many incapable of recognizing\ntumor or tumor-associated antigens. Though these \u201cbystander\u201d T cells have been discounted given their lack of\nTCR specificity for tumors, they are spared from TCR-mediated dysfunction within the TME. Thus, bystander T\ncells are a promising target for novel tumor therapies. Outside of tumors, bystander T cells can become activated\ninto innate-like killers when exposed to combinations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (a phenomenon called\nbystander activation); but it remains unclear if this program can be harnessed intratumorally to elicit tumor killing.\nUsing approaches incorporating TCR-defined bystander T cells, multiple solid tumor models, and in vitro and in\nvivo manipulations, I have found that intratumoral bystander activation is indeed possible but differs across tumor\ntypes. My objectives are 1) to identify the mechanisms of bystander activation (and subsequent cytotoxicity) that\ncan be harnessed for tumor killing, 2) to pinpoint and overcome tumor-intrinsic regulatory mechanisms that blunt\nbystander activation, and 3) to translate these findings to other tumor types. To achieve these objectives, I will\nemploy my expertise in high-parameter single-cell analyses and animal models to uncover the mechanisms that\nshape bystander T cell fate and function in the TME. Hypothesis: My central hypothesis is that bystander T cells\ncan be therapeutically leveraged in solid tumors. AIM 1: In models that permit TME bystander activation, test\nthe hypothesis that indirect- and direct-killing mechanisms of activated bystander T cells contribute to tumor\nrestriction. AIM 2: In models that blunt TME bystander activation, test the hypothesis that immunosuppressive\npathways curb bystander activation and can be blocked to promote anti-tumor responses. My proposed\nexperiments will elucidate the role of bystander T cells in tumors and their therapeutic viability, with the goal of\ndeveloping interventions to improve cancer outcomes, which is in alignment with the mission of the NCI and NIH.\n.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCancer remains a leading cause of mortality within the US, responsible for 1 in 4 deaths. Immunotherapies have\nushered in a new age of cancer treatment, leveraging the potency of the immune system to restrict cancer without\nmany of the side effects of conventional therapies. These immunotherapies have primarily targeted immune\nresponses specific for tumor antigens (tAg). Although tAg-specific T cell immunotherapies have proven powerful\ntools in combatting cancer, their success is context-dependent, displaying limited efficacy in most solid tumors.\nThis is largely owed to chronic T cell receptor (TCR) binding to cognate tAg, leading to permanent cellular\ndysfunction. Solid tumors comprise the majority of cancer cases and deaths, thus, it is essential to exploit other\ncellular modalities in immunotherapies. Recently, it has become apparent that tAg-nonspecific \u201cbystander\u201d T\ncells are observed and often outnumber tAg-specific T cells in solid tumors. Although their function within tumors\nis unknown, bystander T cells can exert cytotoxic effector function once activated by inflammation in a number\nof contexts. My unique approach leveraging T cells with defined T cell receptors (TCRs) allows me to determine\nthe mechanisms that dictate bystander T cell entry into the tumor and if they maintain the ability to respond to\nstimulation once tumor-resident. To appreciate the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironments, I will employ\nmultiple animal models of solid tumors. My objectives are two-fold: First, I want to test how bystander T cells\nmigrate to the tumor and if they are spared from dysregulation due to their inability to recognize tAg. Second, I\nwant to test if the dichotomous effects of bystander T cells can be therapeutically leveraged to improve anti-\ntumor responses. At homeostasis, bystander T cells can simply deny other immune cells access to targets,\nhindering antigen (Ag)-specific immune responses. Once activated by inflammation, bystander T cells rapidly\nacquire effector function and directly kill target cells in an innate-like manner. To achieve these objectives, I will\nemploy my expertise in 28-color flow cytometry to interrogate cell phenotype, activation, and functional capacity.\nI will complement my use of flow cytometry with 3-dimensional immunofluorescence, which will uncover sub-\nanatomic immune cell organization within the tumor. Hypothesis: My central hypothesis is that bystander T cells\nin solid tumors remain functional and can be therapeutically leveraged in cancer specifically. I will test this\nhypothesis through two independent aims: AIM 1: Test the hypothesis that bystander T cells are recruited into\ntumors by CXCR3 and remain functional in the tumor microenvironment. AIM 2: Test the hypothesis that anti-\ntumor immune responses can be enhanced by activated bystander T cells or targeted depletion of tissue-resident\nbystanders. My proposed experiments will elucidate the role of bystander T cells in tumor both with and without\ninterventions, with the goal of developing interventions to improve cancer outcomes, which is in alignment with\nthe mission of the NCI and NIH.",

    "abstract_text": "Upregulation of the purine biosynthetic protein phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS) promotes\nliver cancer cell proliferation and is prognostic for lower liver cancer survival rates. There is a fundamental gap\nin knowledge about how PFAS contributes to the progression of liver cancer. Exacerbating this challenge is a\nlack of molecular tools for the study of the function of PFAS. This underlines the critical need for the development\nof specific inhibitors of PFAS activity, both as probes of function and to form the basis for drug development. The\nlong-term goal of our research program is to develop new anti-cancer therapies that regulate metabolic enzymes\nto extend life and improve patient outcomes. The overall objective of the proposed studies is to identify and\nvalidate specific PFAS inhibitors. Our central hypothesis is that pharmacological knockdown of PFAS activity will\nslow tumor growth in a subset of cancers and lead to improved clinical outcomes. This hypothesis has been\nformulated on the basis of our own preliminary data that shows PFAS knockdown slows liver cancer cell\nproliferation and is also supported by substantial literature associating PFAS upregulation and/or overexpression\nwith increased tumor growth and poorer overall prognoses. The rationale for this work is that a specific inhibitor\nof PFAS is an essential resource needed to address critical gaps in knowledge, rigorously validate this protein\nas a therapeutic target in cellular, tissue, and animal models, and to serve as the foundation for the development\nof a novel class of chemotherapeutic. Guided by strong preliminary studies, we will accomplish our overall\nobjective by pursuing two specific aims: 1) To identify small molecule inhibitors of PFAS enzyme activity, and 2)\nvalidate the activity and assess the selectivity, mechanism of action (MoA), cytotoxicity, and initial structure-\nactivity relationship (SAR) of the hit compounds. To facilitate this work, we have developed, miniaturized and\npiloted a new fluorescent assay for PFAS activity and solved a cryo-EM structure of the human PFAS protein.\nWe will support our hit validation with several secondary enzyme- and cell-based assays which, along with\nextensive cheminformatics and structural studies, will be used to establish potency, selectivity, MoA and initial\nSAR. The proposed work is innovative, in our opinion, because it will generate the first-of-its-kind inhibitors of a\ncentral purine metabolic protein that is strongly correlated with liver cancer survival. Additional innovative aspects\ninclude a novel assay, developed for these studies, and EM structures that will be invaluable assets for structure-\nfunction studies and in support of drug development. The proposed studies are significant because they are\nexpected to produce validated inhibitors for use in elucidating the role that PFAS, and nucleotide metabolism in\ngeneral, plays in support and promotion of liver cancer progression. Ultimately, this has the potential to transform\nliver cancer treatment and improve patient survival by forming the basis for the development of a new class of\ntherapeutic that reduces the activity of PFAS.",

    "abstract_text": "Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), is the most common risk factor for the development of hepatocellular\ncarcinoma (HCC) worldwide. HBV infection can cause HCC before liver cirrhosis, thereby affecting younger\npersons. A recent study from our South American Liver Research Network (SALRN) found that HBV-related\nHCC occurs at earlier ages in Hispanics than HCC related to other liver diseases. This HBV complication is of\nparticular concern as HCC occurs outside of the \u201cstandard\u201d recommended age for starting HCC screening.\nCurrently, individuals with HBV are advised to undergo ultrasonography of the liver every 6 months with the\ngoal of \u201cvisually\u201d identifying a tumor small enough that might be amenable to curative treatment. This visual\nscreening approach has poor adherence due to a variety of issues, such as time commitment, and is\ndependent on the ultrasound operator expertise. We hypothesize that a non-visual screening approach with\nstandardized immune-related blood biomarkers may be a sensible alternative approach. Our group recently\nidentified a series of immune markers detected in serum of patients with hepatitis that were able to predict the\nfuture development of HCC, even when the cancer occurred two years later.\nIn this project, we will investigate whether the hyper-immune environment, product of the continuous presence\nof the virus in the liver, could lead to further alterations in measurable immune analytes in serum so to predict\nearly HCC development. Using our multinational on-going networks of SALRN and ESCALON in Latin\nAmerica, we propose to cross-sectionally and prospectively evaluate peripheral immune variations in Hispanic\nHBV-infected individuals as markers to predict early HCC development.\nIn Specific Aim 1, we will determine if novel immune signatures in the serum of persons with chronic\nHBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma show differential expression compared to controls.\n We will evaluate a pre-defined panel of immune analytes via multiplex cytokine analysis comparing HBV-\n infected HCC cases with controls\nIn Specific Aim 2, we will validate a novel immune signature in serum for identifying those who will\nprogress to hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with chronic HBV infection.\n We will prospectively collect samples from HBV-infected Hispanics in two regions of high HBV prevalence in\n South America and validate our HCC-immune signature\nIn Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate intrahepatic immune markers in HBV-infected livers at risk for HCC.\n We will use spatial genomics intersected with HBV staining in liver biopsies from Latin America to further\n understand the mechanisms behind immunomodulation of HBV-related HCC\nThis study will provide innovative data that will impact Hispanic persons living with chronic HBV infection, seeking\nto create a new standard of care for liver cancer screening in this population.",

    "abstract_text": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) resulting from malignant ventricular arrhythmia accounts for as much as one-\nthird of all cardiac deaths in high-risk populations. Recently, we established a novel concept that organelles that\ntake up and release Ca2+ could contribute to arrhythmic risk, especially during cardiomyopathy. Specifically, we\nshowed that mitochondrial Ca2+ influx contributes to arrhythmic risk in nonischemic cardiomyopathy and that\ninhibiting mitochondrial Ca2+ influx prevents action potential prolongation, triggered activity, and arrhythmia. The\nability of mitochondria to contribute to arrhythmic risk depended on: 1) organelle Ca2+ uptake and release,\nespecially during cardiomyopathy, 2) approximation of mitochondria and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), 3)\namplification of mitochondrial diastolic Ca2+ release by activating SR Ca2+ release, and 4) increased sodium-\ncalcium exchanger (NCX) current during diastole where the current effects are maximized by high membrane\nresistance.\n Cardiac lysosomes may contribute to arrhythmic risk during cardiomyopathy in a similar manner to\nmitochondria. Cardiac lysosomes are best known for their degradative role, but they possess all four criteria\nabove for participation in arrhythmic risk. They maintain an intraluminal free Ca2+ concentration of \u223c500 \u00b5mol/L.\nLysosomal activity and interaction with SR increases in cardiomyopathy. Finally, lysosomal Ca2+ release can\ntrigger diastolic SR Ca2+ release in noncardiac tissues. Lysosomal Ca2+ release is mediated by a two-pore\nchannel (TPC2) and a transient receptor potential mucolipin channel (TRPML1) 13. We will present data that\ncardiac lysosomal TRPML1 but not TPC2 is increased in ischemic heart failure (HF). TRPML1 activation can\ninitiate SR Ca2+ sparks and triggered activity. Conversely, TRPML1 inhibition can prevent triggered activity in\nHF. Finally, SR-lysosomal contact increases during HF.\nHypotheses to be tested: The novel hypothesis is that lysosomes contribute to arrhythmic risk in\ncardiomyopathy by approximating the SR and by releasing Ca2+ during diastole causing SR diastolic Ca2+\nrelease. We will test this hypothesis in three aims.\nSpecific Objectives.\nSpecific Aim 1: Determine whether a lysosomal-SR microdomain exists in ischemic HF.\nSpecific Aim 2: Determine whether TRPML1 Ca2+ release can mediate SR diastolic Ca2+ release in\nischemic HF.\nSpecific Aim 3: Determine whether lysosomal Ca2+ release contributes to arrhythmic risk in ischemic HF.\nSignificance. If correct, this application will establish the novel concept that lysosomes can contribute to\narrhythmic risk, will reinforce the concept that Ca2+ handling organelles are important in arrhythmic risk, and will\nprovide novel targets for antiarrhythmic therapy.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nIn Alzheimer's disease, abnormalities in the morphology, transport, and functions of mitochondria are\nprevalent. Mitochondria are cellular organelles that generate energy to fuel cellular metabolism. Toxic A\u03b242 is\nknown to concentrate in mitochondria. However, how A\u03b242 affects crucial mitochondrial processes that\nmaintain mitochondrial health is still unclear. The long-term objective is to contribute to developing mechanism-\nbased treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease. The overarching goal of this application is to identify the\nmechanisms responsible for A\u03b242's effects on the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression after\ntranscription and mitochondrial dysfunction in a basic cell model. The central hypothesis is that A\u03b242 interferes\nwith mitochondrial liquid-liquid phase separation, causing morphological and functional mitochondrial defects in\nAlzheimer's disease. The rationale for the proposed research is that a mechanism-based determination of\nA\u03b242's role in mitochondrial dysfunction will provide new opportunities for developing novel strategies to\nintervene in Alzheimer's disease. To attain the overall objective, the following two specific aims will be pursued:\n(Aim 1) Investigate the impact of A\u03b242 on mitochondrial ribonucleoprotein granule dynamics in mitochondria.;\n(Aim 2) Optogenetic control of A\u03b242 and mitochondrial ribonucleoprotein granules in mitochondria. At the\ncompletion of these aims, this project will provide insights into how to maintain mitochondrial health by\nmodulating the mitochondrial liquid-liquid phase separation in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Abstract\nDefining mechanisms of CD8+ T cell immune dysfunction is critical to treating immune-mediated diseases.\nBystander memory CD8+ T cells, in particular, are known to be protective to the host by supporting pathogen\nclearance and infection control early in an infection by producing and responding to pro-inflammatory cytokines\nand direct killing of infected cells. However, in some human disease contexts, dysregulation of bystander\nmemory CD8+ T cells has led to immunopathology and poor disease outcomes. The factors that drive this\nphenomenon are unclear. We developed a mouse model to explore the pathological contexts and\nconsequences of bystander memory CD8+ T cells. In our model, immunity to lymphocytic choriomeningitis\nvirus (LCMV) leads to impaired control of an infection with the unrelated bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes\n(Lm). Our preliminary data indicate that mice carrying increased frequencies of LCMV-specific memory CD8+ T\ncells (P14 TCR transgenic cells) die following wild type (WT) Lm. Additionally, our preliminary data suggest\nthat exaggerated inflammation is not the cause of this pathology, as LCMV-immune mice did not have\nimproved bacterial clearance compared to na\u00efve controls and they had markedly elevated levels of serum IL-\n10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. We hypothesize that elevated IL-10 and LCMV-specific bystander\nmemory CD8+ T cell sensitivity to IL-10 is central to dysregulated Lm control in our model. Following\nthis, abundant bystander memory CD8+ T cells cause fatal tissue damage by inappropriate cytolysis of\nuninfected cells, via innate-like mechanisms. I propose the following aims to test these hypotheses: Aim 1\nwill identify the function of IL-10 during a bystander Lm infection of LCMV-immune mice, by IL-10RA blockade\nand by ablating IL-10R on bystander memory CD8+ T cells. Aim 2 will determine the basis for bystander\nmemory CD8+ T cell induced lethal immunopathology by modulating P14 TCR CD8+ T cells to ablate genes\nencoding key proteins involved in bystander immune responses. Together this proposal addresses an\nimportant knowledge gap into mechanisms of immune dysfunction induced by bystander memory CD8+ T cells.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract:\nAtherosclerosis is a disease of the mid- and large-sized arteries that promotes plaque formation. Plaque\ndevelopment can lead to restricted blood flow, vessel rigidity, and in some cases thrombosis. Atherosclerosis is\na major underlying condition that promotes the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease,\nsuch as heart disease and stroke. Atherosclerosis is mediated by chronic exposure to elevated serum cholesterol\nwhich leads to deposition and accumulation of inflammatory cells in the intima-region of the vessel wall.\nMonocyte infiltration is a hallmark of disease progression where cells differentiate into lipid-laden macrophages,\ntermed \u201cfoamy cells\u201d. We interrogated single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) gene expression data from\natherosclerotic plaques which identified genes uniquely associated with foamy macrophages, including the\nmyeloid lipid sensor Trem2. Additionally, an unbiased genome-wide Crispr-screen of in vitro derived foamy\nmacrophages found Trem2 was required for oxidized LDL uptake. However, paradoxically, Trem2 was also\nrequired for efflux of cholesterol in foamy macrophages. Since Trem2 has been associated with enhanced lipid\nuptake in adipose macrophages and efflux in microglia, we sought to test its role in atherosclerosis. Using Trem2-\nknockout and conditional Trem2-deletion approaches, we found Trem2 mediates lipid accumulation in plaque\nmacrophages and loss of Trem2 resulted in a dramatic reduction in atherosclerotic plaque size. Thus, based on\nour preliminary data, we hypothesize that Trem2 regulates foamy macrophage lipid uptake and survival in\natherosclerosis. We have extensive experience studying myeloid cells in atherosclerosis and include newly\ndeveloped monocyte fate-mapping model to track monocyte differentiation in plaque, and a viral atherosclerosis\nregression model, which places our lab in unique position to address the questions outlined in this application.\nIn addition, we incorporate a Trem2 agonistic antibody as an approach to complement deletion experiments to\ndetermine the mechanisms of Trem2 in atherosclerotic disease. Together, we will address the role of Trem2 in\natherosclerosis progression, examine in depth signaling mechanisms in foamy cells that are regulated by Trem2,\nand determine whether Trem2 is a therapeutic target for intervention. Findings from this study represent\npotentially highly impactful knowledge for translation of a novel candidate to drive plaque regression in\natherosclerosis patients.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCancer survivors, even when cured from their cancer, are at an increased risk of excess mortality, attributable\nto higher rates of treatment-related health conditions, most notably secondary malignancies, cardiovascular\ndisease, stroke and late health complications. Growing recognition of these health conditions and their\nresultant morbidity and mortality has led to the development of standardized, cancer survivor-specific\nscreening and surveillance recommendations, with the goals of risk reduction, early detection, reduced\nmortality, and improved quality of life. Cancer survivorship care plans (SCPs), which outline prior cancer\ntreatments, provide a comprehensive plan to address potential long-term effects. Despite the widespread\nimplementation of SCPs into general practice, controversy exists on whether SCPs improve screening and\nsurveillance practices, or reduce mortality. Given the resource burden the creation of SCPs places on the\nhealthcare system and the lack of available efficacy data for their use, it is critical that key measurable\noutcomes, specifically mortality, be investigated to support their ongoing use. The proposal\u2019s objective is to\ninvestigate the impact of SCPs on reducing cancer mortality among adult cancer survivors. The long-term goal\nis to optimize survivors\u2019 health, minimizing chronic health conditions and improving overall mortality in cancer\nsurvivors. Based on our preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that SCPs when applied to the general\npopulation will not improve mortality. However, enhanced SCPs (SCP+) when applied to high risk populations\nwill improve outcomes and mortality. We will test our central hypothesis and attain our objective via the\nfollowing specific aims: Specific aim 1a: Quantify the effectiveness of receiving a SCP (versus no SCP) in\nreducing cancer mortality using institutional 2018-2023 data. Specific aim 1b: Quantify the effectiveness of\nSCP+ and its contribution to mortality in AYA patients, aged 15-39 years (versus no SCP+), using institutional\ndata 2011-2023. Specific aim 2: Using tree-based and random forest causal survival machine learning (ML)\nmethods, identify heterogeneous treatment effects of SCP and SCP+ and characterize those that receive\nmaximum survival benefit relative to all others. The proposed work is innovative in that it compares SCP and\nSCP+ to examine the role of SCPs on mortality, integrates multiple data sources, and uses a novel machine\nlearning technology to identify heterogeneity in group differences in survival. Our research is poised to make a\nsignificant impact by delving into crucial socioeconomic and geographic disparities in care delivery, optimizing\nthe effectiveness of SCPs in minimizing mortality rates.",

SPECS members are focused on unique cancer concerns in our catchment area, \nincluding cancer disparities in special populations and elevated rates of melanoma and hematologic cancers. \nThe impact of the Program is evident with research findings leading to changes in policy around commercial \ntobacco products and national guidelines for cancer screening. Three Specific Aims support the research \nthemes of the SPECS Program: 1) Prevent cancer through identification of risk and protection factors and \ndevelop novel approaches to reduce these risks, 2) Improve cancer outcomes with tailored screening and \nnovel interventions in high-risk populations, and 3) Identify factors that impact prognosis and quality of life \namong cancer survivors. The SPECS Program includes 50 members, representing 6 schools and 20 \ndepartments, and has 2 Co-Leaders: Anne Blaes, MD, MS, a Professor and Division Director of Hematology, \nOncology, and Transplantation in the Medical School; and Heather Nelson, MPH, PhD, a Professor in the \nDivision of Epidemiology and Community Health in the School of Public Health. For the last budget year, these \nmembers were supported by $10.5 million in cancer-relevant research funding (direct costs), of which $4.8 \nmillion is from the National Cancer Institute. \nThe Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) has supported the work of the Program in several value-added ways. The \nAnalytical Biochemistry Shared Resource facilitates biomarker work, and the Biostatistics and Cancer \nInformatics Shared Resources support the design of studies and analysis of data. Community Outreach and \nEngagement has provided data on cancer research needs within our catchment area and provided guidance to \nmembers on conducting community-engaged research. In addition, MCC has provided strategic investment \nthrough pilot project funding. The Program, in turn, brings added value to MCC by bringing clinical and \npopulation-based perspectives with a focus of translating research to practice and policy and addressing health \nequity and cancer concerns in our catchment area.

Throughout\ntreatment for this disease, many patients encounter serious effects, including physical issues like nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue, sleep disruptions, peripheral neuropathy, hair loss, and sexual dysfunction, as well as\npsychological challenges such as cognitive dysfunction, fear of recurrence, anxiety, and depression.\nComprehensively understanding how the prevalence and severity of side effects, unmet needs, and barriers to\nsupportive care affect quality of life (QOL) in diverse ovarian cancer survivors remains a research gap and\npriority. Our long-term goal is to improve the survivorship experience of individuals with ovarian cancer. Our\noverall objective is to document 1) physical and psychosocial concerns, 2) barriers and facilitators to\nsupportive care, and 3) factors associated with unmet needs among ovarian cancer survivors. Our central\nhypothesis is that ovarian cancer survivors face significant challenges, with differences in the frequency and\ntype of concerns by patient characteristics, e.g., time since diagnosis, age, race/ethnicity, sexual identity,\neducation, income, geographic location, and social support network. We will pursue the following specific aims:\n(1) describe the physical and mental health conditions of ovarian cancer survivors that impact quality of life and\ndetail pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions utilized to manage these conditions; (2) identify\nbarriers and facilitators to accessing and receiving supportive care among ovarian cancer survivors; and (3)\ndescribe the unmet needs of ovarian cancer survivors and identify associated risk and protective factors\nrelated to the number and types of unmet needs. We will use a mixed-methods approach. We will recruit a\ndiverse national sample of 2,000 ovarian cancer survivors in collaboration with the California Cancer Registry\nalong with regional and national ovarian cancer advocacy groups to complete a cross-sectional survey. Among\na subset, we will conduct follow-up interviews to gather additional information. The expected outcome of this\nstudy is a comprehensive description of survivorship experiences among diverse ovarian cancer survivors.\nThis detailed information regarding their unmet needs and care gaps will serve as a call-to-action to develop\nand implement targeted interventions to improve QOL of individuals with ovarian cancer. The proposed\nresearch is innovative because we will assess outcomes in diverse ovarian cancer survivors, allowing for\nsubgroup analyses and we will identify care elements that contributed either negatively or positively to\nsurvivors\u2019 experiences. We expect our study will have a significant impact on informing effective strategies that\ncan be readily implemented and expanded to improve the QOL of cancer survivors, an explicit goal of Healthy\nPeople 2030.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nCancer care is becoming increasingly complex, with growing demands on patients\u2019 energy and time. As a\nresult, patients often have to neglect their usual life activities and relationships. Such \u2018time toxicities\u2019 of cancer\nare rarely acknowledged and play little role in care considerations. Further, no scoring systems exist to\nmeasure the time burden of cancer care. Having to weigh potential survival benefits of treatments against\nadded time burdens especially affects those at risk of premature death. Therefore, there is a critical need to\nmeasure and reduce the time toxicities of cancer. The overall objectives of the proposed research are to\ndescribe and quantify sources of cancer-related time toxicity among individuals receiving treatment for cancer\nand their effect on well-being, and to create time toxicity scores which can be used in future studies to identify\nopportunities to minimize time toxicity. The general hypothesis is that combining sensor-based objective data\nwith subjective self-reported measures of time spent on healthcare-related activities will accurately measure\nthe time burden of cancer care and identify areas for interventions related to treatment delivery to reduce this\nburden. This hypothesis will be tested via the following specific aims: (1) Measure and describe components of\nobjective time use associated with cancer-related healthcare interactions via a mobile health application; (2)\nCharacterize associations between measures of cancer-related time use and self-reported well-being, and\nexplore the role of context in modifying these associations; (3) Create a time toxicity summary score based on\nmeasures of cancer-related time use and assess its association with psychosocial outcomes. We will conduct\na 28-day prospective cohort study of 80 individuals with advanced stage ovarian cancer or metastatic breast\ncancer. Using an existing smartphone application, we will automatically track time spent on daily cancer\nactivities, augmented by participant-reported details on specific activities, well-being (daily), and quality of life\n(baseline and end of study). We will estimate associations between objective time use and daily well-being,\nexplore variations in these associations by patient characteristics, develop a multidimensional scoring system\nof time toxicity differentiating between episodic toxicity, travel toxicity, opportunity toxicity, and scheduling\ntoxicity, and measure the associations of these scores with patient reported psychosocial outcomes. Upon\ncompletion we will have developed objective measures of daily time use by cancer activity and patient\ncharacteristics (Aim 1), estimated associations with daily well-being and explored variations by patient\ncharacteristics (Aim 2), and developed a multidimensional time toxicity scoring system (Aim 3). The proposed\nresearch is innovative because time toxicity is a novel concept within cancer survivorship which we will capture\ncombining objective sensor data with self-report data. This study will have a significant impact because time\nmatters to patients and our measures of cancer care time burdens will facilitate future interventions to reduce\ntime toxicity.",

Concomitant creation of an inflammatory milieu\nis thought to facilitate the development of systemic insulin resistance. As lipid peroxidation and pertinent drivers\nare shown to be associated with lifespan and age-related pathologies, I posit that resulting electrophilic lipid\nbyproducts can incite or potentiate senescence in adipose. Produced abundantly in adipocytes by peroxidation\nof mitochondrial phospholipids, lipid aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE)\ncovalently modify nucleophilic protein residues and herein I hypothesize that carbonyl stress exerts oxidative\nstress and mitochondrial dysfunction to induce the senescence program in adipose progenitor cells. Proposed\nstudies would represent the first efforts to thoroughly and systematically characterize the biochemistry and\ncellular signaling underpinning cellular senescence brought on by lipid aldehydes.\nIMR90 fibroblasts continuously exposed to lipid aldehydes for seven days exhibit initiation of the senescence\nprogram, characterized by induction of SA-\u03b2-gal activity and enhanced expression of CDKN1A (p21Cip1), among\nother senescence markers. I\u2019ve termed this type of senescence Biogenic Lipid Induced Senescence, BLIS.\nAssociated with BLIS is the upregulation of an NF\u03baB-independent subset of the putative human SASP.\nFurthermore, I demonstrated that permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes by BAK/BAX channels mediate\nthe BLIS phenotype. The overall mechanism of lipid aldehyde associated senescence is multifaceted and likely\nto involve mitochondrial protein modification, as I observed hallmarks of aberrant mitochondrial function\nconcomitant with development of BLIS markers and alkylation of mitochondrial proteins. Indeed, 4-HNE\nexposure effects reduced mitochondrial spare capacity and increased ADP:ATP ratios. Taken together,\npreliminary data suggest that reactive lipid aldehydes can induce cellular senescence and that adipose\nsenescence may be linked to lipid-mediated senescence induction in fat tissue. Proposed work can be broken\ndown into two aims: in my first aim, I will use a proteomics-based approach to define targets of mitochondrial\ncarbonylation during obesity and aging and in my second aim, I will investigate the role of mitochondrial stress\nand signaling on adipose senescence. During proposed experiments, I will build vital skills as a researcher,\nmost importantly in proteomics data analysis and hands-on in vivo work with mouse models. Backed by a\nmentoring committed composed of faculty active in the field of aging research and spanning multiple departments\nat the University of Minnesota, I am confident an F32 fellowship will facilitate both my development as a\nresearcher and novel, impactful research.",

This proposal builds on a long and rich\nhistory of weight-related research and public health advancement by UMN School of Public Health faculty and\ncolleagues across UMN. This PRC will focus on the CDC\u2019s priority area of improving nutrition, physical\nactivity, health and wellness among children with overweight and obesity from households with lower\nincomes. Given the well-documented systemic drivers of health inequity and powerful social determinants of\nhealth and weight, the center\u2019s work will focus on youth and families from historically underserved\ncommunities, including those of lower income and those identifying as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People\nof Color). The Center\u2019s work is grounded in best practices for dissemination and implementation research and\nleverages deep and long-standing partnerships with community leaders, public health agencies, health\norganizations and other key stakeholder networks with shared commitments to healthy weight promotion. Our\nproposed core dissemination and implementation research project is a Hybrid Type 2 Effectiveness\nImplementation Trial focused on the evidence-based NET-Works intervention designed to promote healthy\neating, activity and weight among preschool age children with overweight or obesity from lower income and\nBIPOC communities. We will partner with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), UMN-Extension and\nlocal public health to understand how to effectively adapt and sustainably implement NET-Works in across\nclinical (FQHCs) and community settings (i.e., UMN-Extension Regions) and develop an implementation\nscience informed and setting-specific strategy for enhancing future implementation processes. Study results\nwill be integrated into an intervention toolkit to be disseminated through local and national channels to facilitate\nimplementation of the evidence-based NET-Works intervention into public health practice. The PRC\u2019s overall\n5-year goals for research, translation, dissemination, training, technical assistance, communication and\nevaluation are to 1) implement an applied research and translation agenda to develop and disseminate\nknowledge and practices for evidence-based innovations in applied public health supporting healthy weight\npromotion; 2) create and support infrastructure, resources, and local, regional and national partnerships that\nfortify the PRC\u2019s ability to advance public health practice for scalable healthy weight promotion efforts; 3)\nprepare future leaders in weight-related dissemination and implementation-oriented research and practice to\neffectively and respectfully engage in community-rooted efforts to enhance health in scalable ways; 4) enhance\npublic health workforce capacity to leverage evidence for practice innovations; and 5) collaborate with national\nPRC network partners to enhance the network and its impact.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThe goals of this proposal are to further train Jenna Mendelson as a scientist conducting cardiovascular basic\nscience research to combat cardiovascular disease and to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of\nright ventricular dysfunction (RVD) in a large animal model. RVD is a significant risk factor for death in\ncardiovascular disease. Yet, there are currently no therapies that directly target the right ventricle. Although\nsmall animal studies reveal important mechanisms, these findings are difficult to translate to humans. Porcine\nmodels may be a better bridge to humans because the anatomical size, structure, and physiology of porcine\nhearts are more similar to humans. Furthermore, we recently showed that in RVD, pigs have a metabolic\nmolecular signature that more closely recapitulates human disease compared to rodents. Mitochondria are\nenergy producing organelles that maintain cellular metabolism. Patients and animal models of RVD have\nmitochondrial metabolic dysfunction and reduced fatty acid metabolism, leading to insufficient ATP to meet\ncardiac energy demands. Glycoprotein 130 (GP130) is the ubiquitously expressed master membrane receptor\nfor interleukin-6 superfamily of inflammatory cytokines. Downstream GP130 activation alters mitochondrial\nfunction, and in a rat model of pulmonary hypertension, we showed that inhibition of GP130 with the small\nmolecule SC144 improved mitochondrial morphology, increased fatty acid oxidation, and improved RV\nfunction. Therefore, this research project will investigate the hypothesis that in a large animal model of RV\npressure overload induced RVD, GP130 antagonism with SC144 will improve RV function by improving\nmitochondrial fatty acid metabolism. Aim 1 investigates the hypothesis that GP130 antagonism will improve RV\nfunction in a porcine model of pulmonary artery banding. Aim 2 will determine if GP130 antagonism with\nSC144 improves fatty acid metabolism. In both aims, we will utilize in-depth physiological assessments\n(cardiac MRI and pressure-volume loop analysis), super resolution confocal microscopy, electron microscopy\nanalysis, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and molecular biology approaches to determine the effects of\nGP130 antagonism with SC144 on RV function and mitochondrial metabolic function. This project has the\npotential to link mitochondrial dysfunction to cardiac MRI and hemodynamic measurements of RV function in\nlarge animals, and identify GP130 signaling as a pharmacological target for RVD. Furthermore, the training of\nMs. Mendelson through this translational proposal will advance the mission of the NIH by helping support the\ntraining of a scientist who will conduct clinically relevant research.",

The\noverarching aim is to assess cognition, neural function, and SUD risk in a sample of patients treated with medical\ncannabis products in Minnesota (n=120) as compared to non-cannabis using controls (n=60) and to differentiate\noutcomes based on prescribed doses and blood concentrations of THC versus CBD as an objective measure of\ndrug exposure. Patients will be aged 35-65 and qualified for medicinal cannabis treatment in Minnesota due to\ndiagnoses of chronic pain. While deficits in learning, memory and executive functions are reliably observed in\nyoung adult recreational cannabis users, it is unclear whether similar impairments characterize individuals who\nuse cannabis for medical reasons, whether adults may be uniquely vulnerable to cannabis-related impairments\nor if, in fact, use in this age group might be neuroprotective. There are very few published studies of medical\ncannabis users that comprehensively focus on neurobehavioral outcomes even though at least 5 million people\nare registered for medical cannabis treatment in the United States. The current study will address this gap\nthrough a pre-post assessment of users as compared to matched controls (pain patients who do not use\ncannabis). Participants will be recruited through posted advertisements and through dispensaries via a\ncollaboration with the primary local supplier of medical cannabis. They will complete a comprehensive pre-\ntreatment behavioral assessment as well as multimodal MRI assessments. Sequences from the HCP-Aging\nbattery will be utilized. All measures will be repeated after four months of treatment. Participants will be\ninterviewed monthly by phone in the interval between visits. Behavioral outcomes, including substance misuse,\nwill be measured. Blood cannabinoid levels will be quantified and correlated with behavioral and neural\noutcomes. Our three aims are (1) To assess impacts of medical cannabis compounds on cognition and behavior\nin otherwise cannabis-naive adults to determine whether impairments that characterize younger users are\nevident after the onset of medical cannabis use; we will also measure treatment-related changes in pain using\nwell-validated measures. (2) To similarly assess the impacts of medical cannabis compounds on white matter\nmicrostructure, functional brain activity and functional connectivity using diffusion-weighted scans, task-based\nfMRI, and measures of resting state connectivity; (3) To differential change over time in these outcomes as a\nfunction of (a) exposure to distinct cannabinoids (THC vs. CBD) as assessed through blood concentrations and\n(b) age. Sex as a biological variable will be assessed as a covariate of interest. Thus, this proposal will yield a\nrich dataset through which medical cannabis effects on adults\u2019 neurobehavioral function can be assessed and\ncontrasted with the literature on non-medical users.",

The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,\na Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under\nRFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and\nwill track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.\nAll participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,\nneuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,\nand culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual\ninterviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of\ndevelopmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and\nparents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through\nadolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our\nunderstanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge\ntechnologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school\ninvolvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)\ninteract with each other and with a child's changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,\nacademic, health, and other outcomes.\nData, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe\nindividual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and\ninfluencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and\ninteraction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen\ntime, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)\ndetermine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)\ncharacterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances\nsuch as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,\nemotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use.",

Despite advancements in\nantiretroviral therapies (ART), there presently is no cure for these infections. Given the continued development\nof antiviral drug resistance, there remains a need for basic science investigations in addressing crucial\nknowledge gaps in the field, such studies can inform antiretroviral target identification, and have broad\napplications towards therapy and cure. One of the key aspects of HIV-1 replication that has remained\nunderexplored has been virus particle assembly. Here in this proposal, the overarching hypothesis being tested\nis that differences in human retroviral capsid (CA) protein structure and CA-CA interactions can provide new\ninsights into particle assembly and help identify conserved features that may be promising antiretroviral targets.\nThere are three lines of investigation being pursued. First, the differential CA interfaces among HIV-2 will be\ninvestigated to examine whether differences in Gag lattice morphologies can be attributed to differences in CA\ninterfaces. Second, comparative analysis between the HIV-1 and HIV-2 capsid core structure will be determined\nto assess whether a novel helix in the HIV-2 mature CA is present and responsible for morphogenesis of the\nmature CA lattice. Finally, the molecular and structural basis for differences in HIV particle assembly and viral\ninfectivity will be investigated using site-directed mutagenesis studies. The proposed studies will provide new\ninsights into the structure-function relationships among CA proteins and enable new insights in human retroviral\nreplication.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThis project aims to advance transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technologies for psychiatric disorders.\nTMS outcomes vary among participants, likely due to a lack of adaptation to individual brain states. We thus\npropose a closed-loop approach where real-time electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain\noscillations can inform the timing of TMS at the prefrontal cortex. However, closed-loop TMS applications are\ncurrently not implemented in clinical practice due to a lack of validated methods for targeting prefrontal brain\noscillations and identifying markers of TMS target engagement. Invasive electrophysiological recordings in\nnonhuman primates (NHPs) offer a high signal-to-noise ratio and improved localization of brain responses.\nSimultaneous scalp EEG recordings will inform translational efforts in humans. We aim to identify markers of\nTMS engagement in the prefrontal cortex from invasive electrophysiological recordings in NHPs and\ndifferentiate direct neural responses from indirect stimulation effects. We will further characterize the effects of\nclosed-loop TMS on invasive electrophysiological responses and determine optimal stimulation parameters. By\ndelivering TMS at different phases and power states, we will measure TMS evoked potentials (TEPs) to\nidentify the most effective stimulation parameters for prefrontal closed-loop TMS. Finally, we will evaluate the\neffects of closed-loop theta burst stimulation (TBS) on neural plasticity. By tracking prefrontal theta rhythms in\nreal-time, we will deliver TMS pulse bursts at specific phases to enhance the effectiveness of TBS protocols.\nWe will assess induced neural plasticity through the measurement of TEPs and local functional connectivity.\nSuccessful completion of this research could lead to the development of improved closed-loop TMS protocols\nfor the prefrontal cortex, with direct implications for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in humans.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Abstract - Overall\nThe burden of climate change is of particular concern to American Indian, rural, and agricultural populations.\nWhile a considerable amount of research has evaluated climate effects in urban and coastal populations,\nlargely due to more abundant data, less is available for rural populations, where there are persistent healthcare\ninequities and deficient health infrastructure. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive health outcomes data at a\npopulation level has limited the evaluation of climate factors such as extreme weather, air pollution, and\ndrought in specific vulnerable groups that are difficult to identify. The burden of climate change is of particular\nconcern to American Indian persons. The historical systematic destruction of their communities and cultural\nconnection to natural systems creating a condition of ecological grief, i.e., grief due to loss or deterioration of\nland, is believed to be linked to mental health conditions, substance use, obesity, and chronic health\nconditions. This project will establish the Mni Sota Center for Climate Change and Health (M3CH). Mni Sota is\nthe Dakota word for \u2018where the waters reflect the sky\u2019, which well describes the Upper Midwest. The long-term\nobjective of the Mni Sota Center for Climate Change and Health is to be a leading research enterprise to\ncharacterize health impacts related to climate change and translate findings to create practical and actionable\nmeasures for climate change adaptation with a specific focus on American Indian and rural communities. The\nobjective of this proposal is to develop regional climate and health research capacity through the M3CH by\nleveraging the multidisciplinary assets of the University of Minnesota, partner institutions, and communities to\ncreate actionable knowledge for addressing the health impacts of a changing climate in the Upper Midwest.\nThe primary focus of the proposed center is to develop capacity to address the impacts of climate change\nexperienced by American Indian persons and people living in rural areas with an emphasis on populations in\nthe Mni Sota region. The Specific Aims of the proposed center are to; 1) Leverage multidisciplinary expertise\nand partnerships to build regional capacity for research on climate change and health that aligns with the\npriorities of target communities. 2)Establish a Community Engagement Core to co-develop a research agenda\nwith American Indian and rural communities that will guide future research using novel and existing data while\nfollowing culturally safe research practices. 3)Support a research project that will develop climate change and\nhealth research capacity using a novel data resource based on a multi-system electronic health records\nconsortium to evaluate the effects of extreme weather events in at risk communities and specifically American\nIndian and rural populations. 4)Establish a Pilot Project and Emerging Issues program that identifies and\nresponds to stakeholder priorities in the co-developed research agenda and creates partnerships that will\nrapidly progress toward substantial research projects.",

This collaboration brings\ntogether expertise in epidemiology, exposure science, climate science, community based participatory\nresearch, American Indian health and wellness, American Indian culture and governance, rural and agricultural\nhealth, health care, health record systems, and community engagement. Leveraging these resources presents\na unique opportunity to build significant capacity in climate and health research. To maximize the potential of\nthis center and efficiently grow the center capacity the Administrative Core will be responsible for the following.\n1. Facilitate communication and collaboration between the M3CH partners and external stakeholders, including\nthe External Advisory Board (EAB) to build capacity and enhance the effectiveness of the center. The EAB will\nconsist of members from different disciplines and sectors with an emphasis on representation from American\nIndian and rural communities. The center will develop a process of regular internal and external\ncommunication to build name recognition and a network of partners. 2. Develop and implement a strategic\nplan that will leverage the assets of the M3CH and current and future partners to build capacity in climate and\nhealth research. The strategic planning process will include short term goals to initiate the activities of the\ncenter and longer term goals to establish a substantial and sustainable research portfolio. 3. Facilitate the\ndevelopment of a substantial and sustainable climate and health research program that will extend the impact\nof M3CH and facilitate career development of underrepresented researchers. This will include the\nadministration of a Pilot Project and Emerging Issues program to engage a diverse array of investigators. The\nPilot Project program will leverage the community informed research agenda developed by the Community\nEngagement Core. 4. Track the progress of center activities to ensure goals are met. The Administrative Core\nwill focus on process evaluation while a more formal evaluation of impact and engagement will be administered\nby the Community Engagement Core. 5. Ensure compliance with appropriate guidelines for research and\nengagement, and specifically the University of Minnesota guidelines for Indigenous Research. 6. Create a data\ninfrastructure plan associated with projects with attention to data sovereignty. 7Ensure appropriate\nmanagement of center resources, activities, budgets, records, and reports. 8.

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThe central premise of the Community Engagement (CE) Core is that communities at greatest risk for negative\nhealth consequences due to climate change are the same communities who will make the most profound\nstrides to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledges (ITEKs; also\nreferred to as Native Science) refers to the evolving knowledge acquired by indigenous communities over\nmillennia through their direct contact with the environment and has recently been recognized as having great\npotential to be leveraged to mitigate the impacts of climate change. To date, much of the existing literature on\nthe capacity of ITEKs to inform efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change exists primarily outside of the\nU.S. Additionally, and as reflected in the White House\u2019s Commitment to Elevating Indigenous Knowledge in\nFederal Policy, efforts are urgently needed to ensure American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN), as well as rural,\nrepresentatives are at the same table as researchers, clinicians, and policy makers who are discussing the\nresults and implications of research on climate and health. Through the Mni Sota Center for Climate Change\nand Health we will build capacity for innovative research related to climate change and health as experienced\nby the two communities who we posit will make the most profound strides to mitigate the impacts of climate\nchange: AIAN and rural communities. This will be achieved by centering ITEKs, conducting community\nengagement with AIAN and rural communities, and by leveraging the multidisciplinary assets and expertise of\nthe University of Minnesota and our partner institutions. The objective of the CE Core is to co-develop, assist,\nimplement, and evaluate strategies that will catalyze the Center\u2019s capacity to examine the impacts of climate\nchange on health and develop action-oriented solutions to protect AIAN and rural persons. The CE Core has\nthe following aims: Aim 1: Co-develop a research agenda that leverages ITEKs and Western environmental\nhealth approaches that identifies a) key research questions related to climate change and health experienced\nby American Indian and rural persons that can be prioritized in future research and b) data sovereignty\nguidelines and other recommendations for culturally safe research practices; Aim 2: Assist Center efforts in\nnavigating climate- and health-related community engaged research by providing expertise in CE from\nplanning to dissemination and culturally safe research practices including data sovereignty; Aim 3: Implement a\nCitizen Science Program that entails digital storytelling (a form of ITEKs) with AIAN youth; Aim 4: Evaluate the\nCenter\u2019s reach and engagement efforts via a multi-pronged approach informed by the RE-AIM Framework,\nGoodman Assessment of CE, and an Indigenous Evaluation entailing storytelling. The CE Core will be highly\nimpactful given that it represents a braiding together of Native and Western science and viewpoints, or two-\neyed seeing approaches, and will engage communities who we posit will make the most profound strides to\nmitigate the impacts of climate change and allies representing researchers, clinicians, and policy makers.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nChronic Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) is associated debilitating pain and dysfunction of the muscles of\nthe jaw, the temporomandibular joints, and related structures. TMD pain is highly prevalent, impacting ~5-12%\nof the general population and over 20% of individuals seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder. Moreover,\ntreatments for chronic pain conditions like TMD, such as opioid analgesics, are relatively ineffective, rarely\nmeet patients\u2019 own criteria for successful treatment, and are associated with significant risk. Therefore, many\npatients seek alternative, maladaptive methods for pain relief, including self-medication with alcohol. Twenty-\nfive percent of treatment seeking people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) report past-month pain, and 25% of\nchronic pain patients report heavy drinking. However, the effects of pain on alcohol consumption behavior in\nheavy drinkers with chronic TMD pain are poorly understood. Despite the need for empirical investigations of\nthe effect of pain on naturalistic drinking behavior, previous work has not directly addressed this question. We\naddress this gap in knowledge by assessing the effect of pain on the microstructure of individual drinking\nbouts, known as drinking topography (DT). The primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of\npain on DT in community-dwelling heavy drinkers with and without chronic TMD pain both in the laboratory and\nin daily life using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). In the laboratory, we will use the Integrated\nTopography and Consumption Tracking in Virtual Reality (INTACT VR) platform to provide a highly-controlled\ndrinking environment, increasing study rigor and reproducibility. In contrast, EMA provides high ecological\nvalidity and the ability to ascertain whether pain-related DT patterns in the laboratory are also observed in the\nreal world. Importantly, our approach is informed by the Catastrophizing, Anxiety, Negative Urgency, and\nExpectancy (CANUE) model, a theoretical moderated-mediation model regarding modifiable psychosocial\nfactors underlying pain as an antecedent for substance use. The results of this study will provide mechanistic\ninformation regarding the effect of pain on alcohol consumption in heavy drinking individuals with chronic TMD\npain, as well as actionable information regarding modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for potentially\nhazardous alcohol use associated with pain self-management. This knowledge will facilitate optimization of\ninterventions to reduce alcohol-related consequences in people with chronic TMD pain. Such interventions can\npotentially also have indirect benefits on chronic pain given evidence that hangover and alcohol withdrawal are\nassociated with increased pain severity.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nExtreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires are manifestations of a changing climate.\nThe Upper Midwest is particularly vulnerable to climatic shifts with Minnesota experiencing the most extreme\nwintertime warming of any contiguous state. Climate impacts are regionally visible, as food sources culturally\nimportant to indigenous tribes have diminished and transitory wildfire smoke events from Canada have\nproduced alarming air pollution events. The Upper Midwest is further home to historically underrepresented\npopulations, including rural and American Indian (AI) residents. These individuals experience some of the\nlargest U.S. health disparities, including higher comorbidities, outdoor and physical occupations, and persistent\nstructural inequities including a sparsity of rural healthcare access. Other unique risk factors may play\nadditional roles in modifying extreme heat health effects, including the use of climate-sensitive medications that\ndisrupt thermoregulation. To evaluate the impacts of extreme weather on high concern Upper Midwest\npopulations, we will partner with the Minnesota electronic health records consortium (MNEHR); a unique group\nwith 9 of the largest Minnesota health care providers giving us access to electronic health records for a near\ncomplete capture of Minnesota\u2019s population (61,000 AI individuals, ~2 million rural residents). This consortium\nrepresents a key resource innovation, as it supports the identification and investigation of high disparity\npopulations while keeping data secure and private. Our team will further collaborate with our Community\nEngagement Core to seek input on research with minoritized populations and ensure that any public health\nfindings are effective and culturally appropriate. In Aim 1, we will characterize the spatiotemporal variability of\nextreme weather in the Upper Midwest and link weather events with sociodemographic data to identify\nhotspots and at-risk communities. This database will become a public resource for people evaluating regional\nclimate change. In Aim 2, we will assess extreme weather impacts among high-climate concern American\nIndian and rural residents in Minnesota. We will estimate the association between extreme heat, cold, wildfire\nair pollution, and compound events of heat plus wildfire and heat plus drought and healthcare admissions for\ncardiopulmonary, heat-related or fluid disorders, non-accidental injury, and mental health issues. In Aim 3, we\nwill assess how climate-sensitive medication may be a unique risk factor for modifying medical encounters\nduring extreme heat events. Patients prescribed diuretics, SLT2i inhibitors, and anticholinergics and may show\nexacerbated health risks during extreme heat exposures. Our research will play a critical role in the Mni Sota\nCenter for Climate Change and Health by building Midwest climate and health research capacity, developing\nnew climate partnerships, and bringing together climate and health stakeholders for public health practice and\nclinical decision. Our research framework will provide a blueprint for future analysis of climate, weather, and\nhealth, including the translation of our work to new regional partners.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nChronic respiratory diseases (CRD), such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, impact over\n554 million people worldwide and are major contributors to the non-communicable disease burden in the\nUnited States. Individuals with CRD show pronounced disparities in disease risk by factors such as age, sex,\ncommunity type, and environment. Air pollution is one environmental risk factor of concern with nearly 135\nmillion people in the U.S. residing in counties experiencing poor air quality. Evidence suggests that air pollution\nregulatory standards, despite their design to protect public health, may be inadequate for CRD populations\nwho exhibit elevated sensitivity to even low levels of air pollution exposure. It is critical to estimate air pollution\nhealth effects, specifically for vulnerable populations, and identify the underlying and unexplored factors that\nelevate risk, including the intersection between personal and community-level disadvantage. Minimizing\nvulnerabilities across groups and by environment is a core principle of environmental justice. Our central\nhypothesis is that individuals with diagnosed CRD represent a high vulnerability population who display\nincreased mortality risk from acute exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone air pollution. An\nadditional emphasis is to identify which individual and neighborhood characteristics increase air pollution\ninequities among CRD patients and unpack their joint contribution to poor health outcomes. To test our\nhypothesis, we will utilize 20 years of records from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and\nspatiotemporally align individual patient data with state-of-the-art high-resolution air pollution models,\nenvironmental metrics, and community sociodemographic and social vulnerability characteristics. Detailed VHA\nrecords provides data innovations absent from many large cohorts, including diagnosis of comorbidities,\ngeocoded home addresses to reduce exposure misclassification, and individual characteristics and behavior,\nsuch as smoking status and body mass index. In Aim 1, we will estimate the mortality risk in CRD populations\nattributed to daily PM2.5 and ozone exposure and identify individual characteristics that exacerbate\nsusceptibility. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the intersection between individual vulnerabilities and neighborhood\ninequities for air pollution associated mortality risk in CRD populations and estimate the differential risk of\nthese contributing causes. In Aim 3, we will estimate the association between air pollution exposure and\nunderlying mortality cause, and quantify non-linear exposure-response relationships, including low-dose\nexposures. Our research will have a meaningful public health impact by informing air quality regulations as\nthey pertain to individuals with CRD and provide evidence for behavioral interventions and treatment of CRD\npopulations to reduce mortality risk. As a modifiable risk factor, reductions in air pollution will disproportionately\nbenefit CRD individuals and reduce potential health disparities in this high vulnerability group.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nResearch Challenge: More than 582,000 people in the US experience homelessness each night, and a\nstaggering 1.25 million people enter the shelter system each year. People experiencing homelessness endure\nextreme adversity, drastically increasing their risk of dying young. Although the response to the homelessness\ncrisis primarily occurs at the local level, local data on homeless mortality is largely unavailable. The limited\nexisting data show substantial variation in homeless mortality rates by place, suggesting that place-based\nfactors may impact mortality risk. However, methodological differences in how existing data are collected and\ncompiled make valid cross-location comparisons difficult. As a result, at present there is no way to rigorously\ntest how local place-based factors\u2014such as policies, service availability, and economic conditions\u2014relate to\nhomeless mortality, which impedes the ability to identify promising local policy solutions or interventions.\nObjective & Specific Aims: The overall objective of the proposed research is to identify policy-sensitive\ndrivers of homeless mortality. This objective will be achieved through the following specific aims: (1) calculate\nhomeless mortality rates for each US state and Continuum of Care (local planning bodies that coordinate\nhomeless services for a specific city, county, or small group of counties), (2) document frontline providers\u2019\nperceived place-based risk and protective factors of homeless mortality, and (3) investigate the association of\nplace-based factors with homeless mortality.\nApproach: The proposed study will use a sequential mixed methods design to provide insight about homeless\nmortality and its place-based predictors. In Aim 1, restricted-access US Census Bureau data on people\nexperiencing homelessness will be linked to Social Security Administration mortality records to estimate area-\nlevel homeless mortality rates. In Aim 2, 48 key informant interviews will be conducted with frontline providers\nof homeless and health care services to identify perceived place-based predictors of homeless mortality. In\nAim 3, using homeless mortality estimates from Aim 1 and potential predictors identified in Aim 2, multi-level\nmodeling will be used to test the association between place-based factors and homeless mortality.\nImpact: This project will yield the first comparable state-level and Continuum of Care-level estimates of\nhomeless mortality as well as identify place-based correlates of mortality. This proposal, which crosscuts the\nmissions of NIA, NICHD, and NIMHD, would have positive impact by identifying potential policy avenues that\ncould bring to bear improved health and reduced mortality among people experiencing homelessness.",

The\ncandidate\u2019s long-term goal is to build an NIH-funded research program in clinical and translational research in\nwomen\u2019s health, studying longitudinal derangements of vascular, neural and hormonal control, that contribute\nto the high rates of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women living with chronic stress\nexposure such as those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder or panic\ndisorder. Over 7 million U.S. adults have PTSD, a disorder associated with a greater risk for hypertension and\nCVD. While healthy premenopausal women are relatively protected from CVD compared to men, a diagnosis\nof PTSD increases CVD risk in women by up to 3-fold. According to the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, over 60 million women in the United States are living with some form of heart disease.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying long-term CVD risk in women with PTSD is of paramount\nimportance to develop intervention strategies aiming at protecting the future health of this vulnerable\npopulation. Based on our preliminary data, the working hypothesis of this project is that: Over time, PTSD\nsignificantly inhibits nitric oxide bioavailability, resulting in accelerated autonomic and vascular dysfunctions in\npremenopausal women; and that these changes are exacerbated by low estradiol (E2) levels and sleep\ndisturbances. Aim 1 will measure longitudinal alterations in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in\npremenopausal women with PTSD and determine the extent to which these alterations are a function of low E2\nlevels and low sleep efficiency at two years follow-up. Aim 2 will measure longitudinal alterations in vascular\nfunction in premenopausal women with PTSD and determine the extent to which these alterations are a\nfunction of low E2 levels and low sleep efficiency at two years follow-up. We will use gold-standard in vivo\nmeasures of sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography), endothelial (FMD) and vascular (applanation\ntonometry) function to study young, traumatized women with and without PTSD.

    "abstract_text": "Abstract: 40 years into the pandemic, stigma remains the most challenging barrier for HIV prevention. A quarter of people living with HIV remain untested, depriving them of opportunities to enter the HIV prevention continuum and access evidence based prevention tools. Testing is particularly low in gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (MSM) who face additional discrimination on account of their same sex behaviors. Stigma can be internalized or anticipated but it is most pernicious when it is enacted in healthcare settings, as this directly bars care access while also discouraging future care seeking. Enacted healthcare stigma is notoriously difficult to measure, as few providers willingly report discriminatory behavior and patients lack the medical knowledge to assess the appropriateness of care. Our solution is to conduct unannounced standardized patient (SP) visits to measure and address enacted healthcare stigma. SPs are actors hired from the local community and trained to present standardized, unannounced disease cases in area clinics for the purposes of evaluation and feedback. Their ability to objectively document provider behaviors through unannounced visits presents an elegant solution to the common tendency of providers to alter behaviors under observation. By randomly varying the sexual orientation and HIV status of presented cases, our technique obtains discrete measures of HIV, sexual, and intersectional stigma. Results of an initial round of SP visits are shared with advisory boards of providers and MSM to solicit their views on stigma drivers which inform a tailored stigma reduction training for study providers which is then evaluated in a second round of visits. Our team has conducted an NIH-funded pilot randomized control trial (RCT) that demonstrated high feasibility and acceptability of the SP approach for measuring and reducing stigma (R34MH121251). This R01 application follows on the success of the R34 to propose a fully powered cluster RCT using tools, lessons, and experience gained from our pilot. This trial will newly include rural clinics to expand generalizability and will also explore future implementation potential of our intervention with regional policy makers. Our interdisciplinary team combines expertise in HIV prevention, stigma, LGBT health, standardized patient research, and medical education to investigate the following aims: 1) Conduct a baseline round of SP visits to inform the design of a SP-informed stigma reduction intervention with support from MSM and provider community advisory boards; 2) implement the intervention in treatment arm clinics and evaluate its impact on enacted stigma and clinic-level HIV testing volume and 3) conduct qualitative interviews with stakeholders (providers, MSM, health officials) to help inform the design of a Implementation Blueprint to guide potential future adopters in assessing its suitability and their team readiness to implement a SP-informed stigma intervention in their setting.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nBiomedical breakthroughs over the past 30 years have dramatically improved treatment and prevention of HIV,\nhepatitis C virus (HCV), and opioid use disorder (OUD). Yet uptake of these HIV-related evidence-based\ninterventions (EBI) remains distressingly low in populations that could benefit from them the most, notably\npeople who inject drugs (PWID).Three structural limitations of current health delivery practices must be\naddressed to improve PWID access to HIV-related EBI: 1) the fragmented nature of the US healthcare system\nthat forces PWID to seek care for infectious diseases and OUD from different entities; 2) the prohibitive\nadministrative burdens of social programs such as Medicaid and Ryan White (complex eligibility requirements,\nburdensome paperwork); and 3) severe stigma toward PWID in healthcare settings that leads to care\navoidance and poor retention in care. We propose an intervention that co-locates telehealth in syringe service\nprograms (SSP) to improve uptake and retention of two key EBI, PrEP and MOUD. Because their practices are\nrooted in harm reduction principles and provide supplies that PWID routinely use, SSPs maintain strong client\nfollow-up and offer many points of entry into care. Telehealth offers a more cost-effective, adaptable, and\nscalable model than in-person care, and recent service advances have generated a strong knowledge base for\nremote delivery of HIV-related care. Our intervention will further address administrative burdens by placing\ncase managers on site to ease administrative burden, and by providing our telehealth providers with an\nevidence based stigma reduction training pioneered by our team. Our work will take place in four SSP sites\nacross Minnesota which is currently experiencing an outbreak of HIV across racially and regionally diverse\ncommunities of PWID. Aim 1. Conduct formative research on determinants of HIV and addiction among\nracially and regionally diverse PWID to inform design of a co-located telehealth program. We will conduct in-\ndepth interviews with N=25 PWID and N=10 advocates from PWID-facing organizations. We will also develop\na tailored stigma reduction training for partnering providers using our proven experimental audit approach. Aim\n2. Develop an integrative, low-barrier, low-stigma telehealth program for urban and rural PWID informed by\nAim 1 findings and input from PWID and providers. Share back of Aim 1 findings will be conducted with 3\nadvisory boards (rural PWID, urban PWID, providers) to enlist their insights in the design of the stigma\nreduction training and key features of the telemedicine program. Aim 3. Pilot a telehealth intervention in\nracially and regionally diverse SSPs to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact. Uptake and\nretention of PrEP and MOUD will be tracked for 6 months in 80 PWID across 4 SSPs (2 rural, 2 urban).\nFeasibility and acceptability will be informed by process indicators (enrollment, uptake, retention) and exit\ninterviews. Preliminary impact will be assessed through a pre-post comparison of electronic medical records\n(EHR) from a state-wide data sharing platform.",

    "abstract_text": "Revised Project Summary/Abstract-Data Core \nState policymakers have made large investments in programs to support people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease-related dementia (AD/ADRD) and their caregivers, but the effects of these investments on AD/ADRD programs and outcomes are largely unknown. Much of the data needed to conduct these evaluations are siloed and restricted across agencies and platforms due to complex issues of data privacy and linkage. States do not necessarily have the technical expertise and computing resources to overcome these challenges, and researchers outside of state governments can face hurdles in accessing data owned by states. To address these barriers, the Data Core of the proposed State Alzheimer\u2019s Research Support Center (StARS) will create a centralized set of resources and data for state policymakers and outside researchers to rigorously evaluate integrated/coordinated dementia care programs, including their effectiveness in delaying or preventing care transitions. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary group with expertise in AD/ADRD, data infrastructures, and federal, state, and sub-state data to complete the following aims: 1) create a data warehouse and data governance plan to support the rigorous evaluation of state AD/ADRD programs and policies, including an inventory of state regulations governing home and community-based dementia services, a catalog of the data contributed and created via StARS investigators and affiliates, and standardized processes for ingesting/extracting, harmonizing, and linking data while protecting privacy; 2) provide overall intellectual and technical assistance to states in obtaining data use agreements, uploading data, and cleaning, linking, harmonizing, and analyzing data; and 3) disseminate data products (e.g., aggregated and de-identified data sets), chartbooks (e.g., state summaries of AD/ADRD prevalence and service utilization), resources (e.g., data dictionaries and metadata), and best practices (e.g., via Data Workshops) on data analysis. We will work closely with the other StARS Cores, conduct rigorous evaluation of our performance metrics, and emphasize flexibility and responsiveness to the unique needs of each of the Center affiliates. By establishing this robust and sustainable infrastructure and deep relationships with state data providers, our highly qualified and multidisciplinary team will motivate other state entities to share data resources, thereby promoting more rapid improvement in care for persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe opioid epidemic is a persistent public health crisis that has been worsened by the COVID19 pandemic.\nEfforts to curtail this epidemic have had minimal success in halting its continued progression. There is a critical\nneed to more fully understand the neurobiology of opioid use disorder so that highly novel therapeutics can be\ndeveloped. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have found that opioid use increases the levels of phosphory-\nlated tau protein in the brain, especially in the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex plays a significant role in\nthe control of opioid use. Hyperphosphorylated tau is a hallmark of neurodegenerative tauopathy-related dis-\neases such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and frontotemporal dementia. However, opioid use does not appear to be a\nmajor predisposing factor in the development of these diseases. This begs the question of whether opioid-in-\nduced increases in phosphorylated tau are a simple byproduct of opioid use with no significant role in brain\nhealth, or if this increase has significant biological relevance for mediating the neurobehavioral consequences\nof opioid use. Focusing research efforts on whether opioid use produces neurodegenerative diseases may lead\nto a missed opportunity to explore a non-neurodegenerative role for opioid-induced changes in tau biology. It is\nknown that hyperphosphorylated tau can and tau oligomerization alter neurotransmission long before tau-related\npathology is observable. Therefore, we reason that opioid-induced increases in phosphorylated tau and tau oli-\ngomerization may alter prefrontal cortical neurotransmission in the absence of any overt pathology. This project\nproposal tests the hypothesis that opioids produce enhanced tau phosphorylation and oligomerization in the\nprefrontal cortex leading to synaptic dysfunction and elevated opioid consumption. We will focus on the opioid\noxycodone in this project due its long-term use to treat pain as well as its common misuse in those with opioid\nuse disorder. We will use a multidisciplinary approach to test for a causative role for prefrontal cortical tau in\nproducing synaptic dysfunction and enhancing oxycodone consumption. This project is high-risk, high-reward. It\nis conceivable that opioid-induced changes in tau have nothing to do with synaptic changes or oxycodone con-\nsumption. However, if there is a connection between opioid-induced changes in tau biology and synaptic\nchanges and opioid use, then this will be a paradigm shift for the opioid research field. In the future, after some\nadditional exploration, we may be able to leverage therapeutics originally designed to treat neurodegenerative\ntauopathies to treat opioid use disorder. This would be an entirely new avenue for combatting the opioid epi-\ndemic.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe number of children born to opioid-dependent mothers has increased over 300% in the past two decades.\nAs abstinence from opioids during pregnancy is not recommended, opioid medication replacement therapy, such\nas methadone, represents the standard of care for pregnant women with opioid use disorder thus perpetuating\nthe birth of these opioid-exposed babies. Previous work has shown that prenatal opioid exposure predisposes\nfor future substance misuse. Given its widespread accessibility, alcohol is one of the most likely addictive sub-\nstances that these prenatal opioid-exposed children will encounter. Due to the significant morbidity and mortality\nassociated with excessive alcohol drinking, it is critically important to understand how prenatal methadone ex-\nposure (PME) predisposes these children for future problematic alcohol use and how alcohol interacts with PME\nto produce differential behavioral responses to alcohol. To elucidate mechanisms related to how PME may pro-\nduce enhanced alcohol-related behaviors, we developed and validated a mouse model of PME. Our model re-\ncapitulates many clinical features of prenatal opioid exposure, including producing neonatal opioid withdrawal.\nUsing our model, we find that PME increases alcohol drinking only in males, consistent with many clinical and\npreclinical studies that show that males are more severely impacted by prenatal opioid exposure. Given the role\nof the dorsal striatum brain region in modulating many aspects of alcohol drinking, we biochemically explored\nthe proteome of the dorsal striatum and found that PME had a greater effect on protein and protein phosphory-\nlation expression in males than females, consistent with our drinking data. Pathway analyses of our proteomics\ndata implicated glutamate and long-term synaptic depression plasticity (LTD) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS)\nas being disrupted by PME. We further discovered that PME reduced dorsal striatal glutamate transmission and\ndisrupted LTD. Recent work from our laboratory demonstrates that alcohol induces glutamatergic synaptic plas-\nticity and disrupts LTD at anterior insular cortex inputs to the DLS (AIC\uf0e0DLS synapses) in mice, but only in male\nmice and this was associated with enhanced male alcohol drinking behavior. We reasoned that the male-specific,\nPME-induced increase in binge-like alcohol consumption may utilize similar mechanisms as the male-specific,\nalcohol-induced AIC\uf0e0DLS synaptic changes that govern excessive alcohol consumption. We hypothesize that\nPME produces synaptic adaptations exclusively in males that enhance AIC\uf0e0DLS glutamatergic transmission\nthat in turn govern the elevated binge-like alcohol consumption seen in male, but not female PME mice. In this\nproject we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining home-cage binge drinking with brain slice electro-\nphysiology, dorsal striatal cell type reporter mice, quantitative synaptic proteomics, ultrastructural expansion mi-\ncroscopy, and wireless in vivo optogenetic manipulations of synaptic transmission. This project will provide crit-\nical neural mechanistic knowledge for deciphering how PME enhances future alcohol drinking behavior in males\nand why females may be resistant or resilient to the effects of PME.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSubmitted in response to RFA-DA-24-063, we propose to develop novel, brain-penetrant, small molecule biased\nallosteric modulators (BAMs) of the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) to attenuate relapse to opioid seeking in\nindividuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). NTSR1 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is highly\nexpressed in dopamine (DA)-rich brain regions and modulates brain DA signaling. NTSR1 ligands counter the\neffects of multiple classes of misused drugs. As a GPCR, NTSR1 signals via heterotrimeric G proteins and \u03b2-\narrestin proteins. While NTSR1 has long been recognized as a promising target for the treatment of chemical\naddictions, development of balanced NTSR1 agonists that active both pathways is precluded by on-target side\neffects (i.e., hypothermia, hypotension). Our collaborative team developed a series of first-in-class \u03b2-arrestin\nBAMs of the NTSR1, which attenuate psychostimulant drug effects without the side effects characteristic of\nbalanced NTSR1 activation. While NTSR1 is a well-established therapeutic target for stimulant use disorders,\nand its mechanism of action suggests utility that spans drug class, its validity as a target for OUD has not been\nrigorously established. The limited data available on NTSR1\u2019s effect on opioid action is promising. Our data\nsuggest that first generation \u03b2-arrestin NTSR1 BAMs act via a reward mechanism conserved across drug classes\nand attenuate both stimulant and opioid drug self-administration. In aim 1, we will validate NTSR1 as a drug\ntarget for the treatment of OUD with our optimized lead BAMWe will leverage a mouse model of relapse to\nintravenous (IV) opioid seeking, NTSR1 knockout (NTSR1-/-) mice, and our extensive knowledge of \u03b2-arrestin\nBAM pharmacology. Recently, we discovered that these compounds block NTSR1 signaling via some G\nproteins, but permit signaling via others. Because balanced NTSR1 agonists promote drug seeking, we\nhypothesize that this G protein permissiveness detracts from the therapeutic utility of these BAMs in OUD. In\naim 2, we will discover next generation \u03b2-arrestin BAMs for NTSR1 with improved \u03b2-arrestin selectivity\nto test this hypothesis. We conducted comprehensive signaling characterization for a panel of ligands from our\nlead series. In addition, we have robust cell-based assays (and appropriate counter-screens) to reliably monitor\nNTSR1 activation of more than 14 transducers. Leveraging these assets, we will conduct a medicinal chemistry\ncampaign to increase the potency and \u03b2-arrestin selectivity of BAM scaffold, with a flow scheme consisting of\ncell-based receptor signaling assays and early assessment of ADME, brain penetration, and central NTSR1\nengagement. We have stringent criteria for second-generation leads. Compounds that match this profile will be\nadvanced to efficacy testing in a model of relapse to IV remifentanil seeking in wild-type and NTSR1-/- mice. This\nmultidisciplinary research plan capitalizes on the unique scientific and drug discovery expertise of our team and\nis a critical step towards our goal of developing therapeutics to facilitate recovery in individuals with OUD.",

    "abstract_text": "The US is currently grappling with an escalating drug overdose crisis, with overdose deaths soaring to a record high of 110,000 in 2022 alone. This crisis has particularly devastating effects on African American, American Indian/Alaska Native and other racial/ethnic minority populations. Harm reduction strategies, such as naloxone distribution, are pivotal components of the US Department of Health & Human Services Overdose Prevention Strategy. While many jurisdictions across the country are actively expanding the availability of evidence-based harm reduction programs, the complexity of the overdose crisis necessitates a multifaceted and localized\napproach that goes beyond individual interventions. The availability of over $50 billion in legal opioid settlements nationwide, alongside innovative harm reduction interventions, such as overdose prevention centers, drug checking programs, and overdose detection technologies, presents unprecedented opportunities to address the overdose crisis and its harms comprehensively. Our project aims to design tailored harm reduction strategies that effectively address the heterogeneous nature of overdose epidemics, demographics, and local infrastructures across six distinct jurisdictions. Building on our previous work optimizing naloxone distribution strategies in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York City, we will collaborate closely with health departments and community partners to assess the effectiveness, cost-\neffectiveness, and health equity outcomes of different harm reduction strategies in these and three new jurisdictions (Minnesota, Missouri, and Nevada). Through adapting a mathematical model and developing locally tailored decision tools, we will identify portfolios of harm reduction strategies that minimize fatal overdoses, maximize health equity, and provide value for money.\nCentral to our approach is stakeholder engagement and the implementation of evidence-based interventions tailored to local contexts. By engaging relevant stakeholders in the adaptation and customization of our model and decision tools, we seek to ensure their integration into decision-making processes and their sustainability beyond the duration of our project. Furthermore, guided by implementation science, we will assess the fit and scalability of the model and decision tools in supporting data- and equity-informed policy decisions. This project will create urgently needed, publicly available evidence and resources that can guide the allocation of opioid settlement funds and inform the adoption of sustainable and scalable harm reduction strategies.\n \nThis study is part of the NIH\u2019s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction.",

    "abstract_text": "Revised Project Summary/Abstract-Partnership and Engagement Core \nStates across the U.S. have important data that could be used to improve care coordination, transitions, and access in dementia care; however, they often do not have the resources to plan and conduct the required research. Time, funds, and expertise are needed to create and strengthen collaborations between stakeholders. Moreover, guidance is needed to help states identify the most pressing system-based issues when designing impactful, innovative, and feasible studies to address them. In close collaboration with the other Cores, the Partnership and Engagement Core (PE Core) of the State Alzheimer\u2019s Research Support Center (StARS) will assist states with these activities by completing the following three aims. First, over a two- year, two-phase process per state (N=8 \u201cState Partners\u201d; two per year for Years 1-4), we will strengthen and support new, within-state partnerships and guide the development and completion of one or more state-based research pilot projects. In the Partnership Phase (Year 1), we will conduct information gathering with each state through surveys, interviews, and a desk analysis, all of which will inform an in-person Partnership Building Roundtable with SWOT analysis to be held in that state. This activity will be followed by ongoing virtual support check-in meetings until that State Partner\u2019s pilot proposal has been submitted to the Center. In the Pilot Phase (Year 2), we will support the efforts of the Research/Pilot Core in leading a second, in-person Pilot Roundtable and take part in ongoing research support. Second, we will create Lived Experience Panels in each state, composed of persons living with dementia (PLWD) and caregivers of PLWD that will provide feedback on all Aim 1 activities. Third, we will offer national expertise to State Partners and pilot awardees from three National Advisory Boards, namely: researchers with expertise in dementia services, public and private long-term care providers, and state dementia service coordinators. A detailed evaluation plan with clear benchmarks has been developed, and we will publish a minimum of three manuscripts highlighting the processes and tools used as well as our learnings from working with State Partners and the state LEPs. Through these activities, the PE Core will help build a Center where research-activated states from all U.S. regions will serve as \u201cseeds\u201d to encourage the involvement of additional states in creating a national data source that can inform policy making around effective practices in integrated/coordinated dementia care services.",

Consequently, research to better understand and improve systems of care can be equally complex, involving challenges related to data access, reconciling multiple stakeholder perspectives, and applying advanced analytic approaches. In line with the State Alzheimer's Research Support Center\u2019s (StARS\u2019) goals to better understand and improve care within states for persons with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) and their caregivers, the Research/Pilot Core will solicit, select, support, rigorous pilot research. One-year pilot projects of up to $110,000 in total costs each will be awarded via two pathways: from state partnerships identified and guided by the Partnership and Engagement Core (Pathway 1), and direct application by other investigative teams seeking to evaluate integrated/coordinated dementia care services within their states (Pathway 2). Our four proposed aims are to: 1) develop criteria and processes for the solicitation, selection, funding, development, monitoring, and dissemination of up to 16 pilot projects (up to four per year during years 1-4) that are focused on state-level policy and/or contextual factors influencing care coordination and integration for persons living with dementia and their caregivers; 2) ensure that pilot projects are well-designed, timely, rigorous, and meet data and code sharing requirements by providing guidance, oversight, technical assistance, and access to Center data and support resources; 3) assist in the further development, translation, and dissemination of completed pilot projects to key stakeholders, decision-makers, and leaders to promote translation of findings to practice and policy; and 4) expand the expertise and network of funded pilot awardees by offering support after projects have concluded via research/pilot grant review opportunities, ongoing communication, networking, and data sharing activities. Close coordination with the StARS 4U Team will ensure relevance to all communities. The Research/Pilot Core is led by an experienced, visionary, multidisciplinary team focused on advancing dementia care quality, access, and delivery. This Core will contribute notably to our knowledge of the structure, process, and outcomes (e.g., care transitions) of integrated/coordinated dementia care services, how they vary by state, as well as examine the effects of policy variations/changes and other contextual factors on dementia care services within and across states.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nStimulation of beneficial neuroplasticity is a crucial component in promoting recovery from neurological diseases\nor insults like spinal cord injury and stroke. Respiratory neuroplasticity, in the form of phrenic long-term facilitation\n(pLTF), can be induced non-pharmacologically via acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH). However, it is abolished in\nconditions of low circulating sex hormones or elevated systemic inflammation. At present, the interaction of sex\nhormones, CNS inflammation, and mechanisms of neuroplasticity are not well understood. The long-term\nobjectives of this research are to understand the mechanism of microglial-mediated inflammation in cases of\nreduced circulating estrogen. Our central hypothesis is that reduced levels of circulating estrogen provoke a\nmicroglial-mediated increase in inflammatory cytokine gene and protein expression in the spinal cord,\naccompanied by altered microglial morphology, which inhibits plasticity. The hypothesis will be tested through\ntwo specific aims. 1: Define the inflammatory cytokine signature of the ventral cervical spinal cord of\nfemale rats across estradiol states. The approach for this aim will involve assessment of inflammatory-related\ngene and protein changes in the ventral cervical spinal cord of female rats using quantitative reverse transcription\npolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and multi-color flow cytometry, respectively. Further, we will determine if\ncytokine changes are driven by spinal microglia by assessing isolated microglia from ventral cervical spinal cords\nof ovariectomized and naturally cycling female rats. 2: Determine the role of spinal cord microglia in\nmodulating the expression of phrenic neuroplasticity in states of reduced estradiol. The approach for this\naim will be to apply three dimensional Sholl analysis to cervical spinal cord segment images to allow\nquantification of altered microglial morphology across low and high states of circulating estradiol. Multi-color flow\ncytometry will be used to quantify microglial proliferation. Secondly, female rats will be treated with a CSF1R\ninhibitor to transiently eradicate CNS microglial populations. AIH-induced pLTF will be measured via in vivo\nphrenic neurophysiology. This proposed research will contribute to science by establishing the mechanistic role\nand molecular signature of spinal microglia in inhibiting plasticity in states of low estradiol. These contributions\nare expected to be significant in advancing neuroplasticity research because they will support the need to\naccount for sexual dimorphisms when designing and implementing novel neurotherapeutic interventions. The\nproposed research is part of a fellowship training plan with extensive hands-on training and mentoring in technical\nand professional research skills necessary to become an independent clinician-researcher. Primary research\nactivities and training will take place at the University of Minnesota Medical School with additional training at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison. The University of Minnesota\u2019s strong foundation in research and the support\nof the Rehabilitation Science graduate program will create an ideal environment for completing this training.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nRNA plays numerous roles in biology. In addition to its canonical role in the central dogma as an\nintermediary between DNA genomes and protein products of translation, a myriad of roles have\nbeen described for this molecule, including gene silencing (siRNA), regulation of translation\n(bacterial riboswitches), and the translation machinery itself (rRNA). Despite the importance of\nthese roles in biology, tools for imaging RNA are not as robust as the suite of fluorescent proteins\nthat exist for readout of protein machinery. This project seeks to address this need by developing\nnew fluorescent aptamer tags for RNA visualization. This strategy has enjoyed considerable\nsuccess, particularly in bacterial systems, but deployment in complex systems (eukaryotic, whole-\norganism) has been challenging. Recent work on RNA folding has shown that a noncanonical\nRNA structure (a G Quadruplex) may impair the use of aptamers as tags in these systems. This\nproject seeks to select fluorescent aptamers that are not G-Quadruplexes. We will seek select\nnon-G-quadruplex-forming aptamers against a range of azo dyes (Aim 1) and endogenous\npigments (Aim 2) for robust live-cell imaging, and a long-range goal of whole-organism RNA\nimaging. We will use these tags to characterize Lin28-mRNA interactions, which is not possible\nwith existing G-quadruplex-forming aptamers, because Lin28 is known to unfold G-quadruplexes\nin RNA. We will also develop benchmarking tags for our selected aptamers by selecting non-G-\nquadruplex-forming aptamers to known aptamer ligands, which we will use to compare our\nselected aptamers.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract.\nThe Myc gene family encodes three highly conserved transcription factors (N-, c-, L-), known to be oncogenic\ndrivers in many cancers. Dysregulation of Myc proteins is estimated to drive 30% of all cancers, attributed to\ninappropriate amplified Myc expression and dysregulated behaviors. c-Myc is prominent in a wide variety of\ncancers, due to its broad expression patterns, where N-Myc and L-Myc are tissue specific and heavily associated\nin neuroblastoma and small cell lung carcinoma, respectively. Due to its prevalent cancer involvement, Myc\nfamily transcription factors are considered an attractive anti-cancer target, but their disordered nature makes\nthem poor drug targets. Protein-protein interactions of Myc with other regulatory partners creates an opportunity\nfor therapeutic intervention via indirect targeting, yet structural details of many Myc interactions remain unclear.\nThe N- and c-Myc binding partner Aurora Kinase A (AurA), a serine-threonine kinase, is hypothesized to stabilize\nMyc by preventing proper ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the SCFFbxw7 ubiquitin ligase complex. In this pro-\nposal, fluorescence anisotropy and time-resolved fluorescence will be utilized to fully assess binding of AurA at\nvaried phosphorylation states and lengths of c-Myc. To structurally characterize a c-Myc/AurA complex I will\npursue extensive training in X-ray crystallography alongside my experience using continuous-wave electron par-\namagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) spectroscopy to study the interface of this interaction, proposed within. My\npreliminary work has supported the formation of an AurA/c-Myc/Fbxw7 complex, of which I will structurally char-\nacterize using continued training in cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Further characterization of c-Myc\nstabilization and ubiquitination patterns by AurA using my developed in vitro ubiquitination assays will result in a\ndefined mechanism of AurA induced stabilization of c-Myc. The high conservation of regulatory protein binding\ndomains across Myc family transcription factors suggests a role of AurA stabilization of L-Myc, already identified\nfor N- and c-Myc. The work and training I receive studying the c-Myc/AurA interaction will build foundations for\nmy future independent research on defining an impact of AurA on L-Myc stabilization, a widely understudied Myc\nfamily member. I will also use in cellular work to characterize the physiological protein interactions involved in L-\nMyc regulation and dysregulation, including kinases and SCF ubiquitin ligase components, currently unidentified.\nThe extensive X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM training proposed within will add a strong structural biology\nfoundation to the independent research program I plan to develop at an R1 institution. The focus of my lab will\nbe rooted in characterizing the regulation mechanisms of disordered transcription factors in cancer and disease.\nI believe the extensive structural biology and biophysical background from proposed training and extensive ex-\nperience will make me a competitive candidate for a future tenure-track faculty role.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is one of the most urgent prevention and treatment\nchallenges in public health today given its increasing prevalence, limited therapeutic options, and substantial\nburden on global health care systems. Exercise-based prevention and treatment strategies for HFpEF have\nhistorically focused on the promotion of aerobic exercise. However, given the coinciding epidemics of physical\ninactivity and obesity in the U.S., and the compromised aerobic capacity and exercise intolerance in patients\nwith HFpEF, long-term adherence to aerobic exercise is generally poor and thus, the prevention and treatment\nof HFpEF remains a major public health challenge. Thus, aligned with NHLBI research priorities for HFpEF,\nresearch is critically needed to: (1) identify optimal strategies for improving adherence to exercise in the\nprevention and treatment of HFpEF; and (2) examine biological pathways linking exercise to HFpEF. In the\nproposed project, Dr. McDonough, an exercise science and public health researcher, will examine the isolated\nrole of resistance exercise in the prevention and treatment of HFpEF with examination of potential biological\nintermediates. With the exceptional mentorship team he has assembled, comprised of prolific epidemiologists,\nphysician scientists, and methodologists, and the resources available to him through the University of Minnesota,\nthis Postdoctoral Career Transition Award to Promote Diversity will support Dr. McDonough in filling critical\ntraining gaps and conducting the research necessary to launch his career as an independent investigator utilizing\ncohort studies to inform his future clinical trials in the treatment and secondary prevention of HFpEF. To prepare\nhim for this role, a multifaceted training plan including coursework, mentorship, and research is proposed in: (1)\nthe analysis of longitudinal data from cohort studies using a variety of multivariable regression modeling\napproaches; (2) the pathophysiology and epidemiology of HFpEF and how to safely implement exercise training\nin patients with HFpEF; (3) advanced clinical trial methods and statistical analyses; and (4) advanced\nepidemiologic statistical modeling of pathways and mediators. The expertise Dr. McDonough develops through\nthis training plan will be essential for conducting the proposed research. During the mentored K99 phase, he will\nleverage NHLBI cohort studies to elucidate the independent role of resistance exercise in HFpEF primary and\nsecondary prevention (Aims 1-3). In the independent R00 phase, Dr. McDonough will conduct an independent\nfeasibility clinical trial examining the effect of resistance exercise on liver fat and subsequent functional capacity,\nquality of life, and intervention adherence in HFpEF patients (Aim 4). Findings from this project will provide the\nrequisite preliminary data to support an NIH R01 grant proposal examining novel exercise therapies for improving\nhospitalization, mortality, and physical activity outcomes in HFpEF patients, in line with NHLBI, AHA, and ACC\nresearch priorities. In turn, Dr. McDonough will be well-positioned for a successful transition to an independent\nresearch career at an R1 institution while helping to enhance diversity in the biomedical research enterprise.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe past decade has witnessed exponential surges in social media use among U.S. adolescents. Meanwhile,\nas mental health problems increase for all ages, the adverse trend is particularly striking among adolescents.\nDespite vigorous discussion about the contribution of social media to worsening mental health in adolescents,\nlittle objective data exist about how adolescents use social media and how it affects mental health. Few studies\nhave examined strategies adopted by adolescents to regulate and manage their social media use; few have\nused detailed and objective measures of social media use and content exposure; and almost no longitudinal\nstudies exist incorporating the strategies, social media use, and mental health. To fill these critical gaps, we\npropose a 2-year longitudinal mixed-method study with a national sample of 400 adolescents aged 13-17\nyears. Phase 1 will collect preliminary data from 100 adolescents to establish measure feasibility and optimize\nresearch procedures (Aim 1a). In Phase 2, a full-scale longitudinal data collection will be completed with 300\nadolescents. Phase 1 will focus on one 14-day-long epoch where we will (1) collect daily diary reports of social\nmedia management strategies (SMMS; targeted at access, duration, timing, risky content, and risky social\nrelations) and the social sources and approaches/tools for SMMS implementation, (2) administer baseline and\nend-of-epoch surveys on mental health, and (3) conduct semi-structured interviews among a subsample.\nDuring Phase 1, we will also use our existing pilot data of 154 adolescents to establish algorithms for\nprocessing data from Phase 2 (Aim 1b). Phase 2 will involve a baseline survey and 8 14-day epochs (2 years\nX4 quarterly epochs/year). During each epoch, in addition to the SMMS daily diary reports and end-of-epoch\nmental health survey, we will also use the Screenomics approach to continuously capture screenshots of\nadolescents' phone screens every 5 seconds to measure multiple granular objective indicators of social media\nuse. Screenomics was IRB-approved, implemented, and proven secure and feasible in our pilot study. Annual\nsemi-structured interviews will also be conducted among a Phase 2 subsample. The Phase 2 design will\nenable the examination of daily reciprocities between the multiple SMMS domains and social media use\nindicators (Aim 2), and the bidirectional dynamics associating SMMS, social media use, and their reciprocities\nwith mental health (Aim 3). This highly innovative project will provide urgently needed information regarding\nhow adolescents manage their social media use on a daily basis, which strategies influence actual social\nmedia use, and how the strategies and social media use captured through objective data influence and are\ninfluenced by mental health. Findings will offer informative solutions for healthier and safer use of social media\nto educators, practitioners, parents, policy makers, technology companies, and adolescents themselves. This\nwork will also directly inform interventions aimed at maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms of social\nmedia on adolescents' mental health with effective strategies that are well received by adolescents.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCatheter-based renal nerve ablation (CBRNA) decreases blood pressure (BP) and disrupts the chronic\noveractivity of sympathetic efferent renal nerves thought to underlie neurogenic hypertension (HTN), diminishing\nthe risk for developing other cardiometabolic diseases. Studies have demonstrated that a contributor to the\ndevelopment of neurogenic HTN is sensory afferent renal nerves (ARNs) whose input to central autonomic\nregions modulates sympathetic outflow to other organs. Recent work from our lab has identified the close\nproximity of ARNs to glomeruli in the renal cortex, which is novel in comparison to the traditional view that ARNs\nprimarily innervate the renal pelvis. The implication of ARNs in regulating BP and the identification of ARNs in\nthe renal cortex indicates the need for the role of ARNs in kidney function and autonomic processes to be\ninvestigated. This proposal aims to address this gap in knowledge by 1) elucidating the central\nterminations and regional specificity of renal afferents, and 2) identifying how renal afferent input\ninfluences the activity of central autonomic regions that regulate blood pressure using a salt-induced\nmodel of hypertension. Aim 1 will use viral vector-based neurotracing to label ARNs from the renal cortex and\nrenal pelvis of the kidney to identify their central terminations. I hypothesize that two distinct populations of ARNs\ninnervate the renal cortex and pelvis respectively, and project to distinct primary central termination sites. Tracing\nwill be visible throughout the neuroaxis including the renal vasculature, dorsal root ganglia, nodose ganglia,\nspinal cord, and brainstem. Aim 2 will be completed using the deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt mouse\nmodel, which induces HTN through sodium and water retention, in targeted recombination of active populations\n(TRAP2) mice where the fluorescent reporter protein tdTomato is expressed under the immediate-early gene c-\nFos, a neuronal activation marker, via tamoxifen-inducible Cre. The expression of tdTomato will be quantified as\na direct measure of c-Fos in brain regions known to be involved in BP regulation during early DOCA-salt HTN\ndevelopment and compared to immunolabeled c-Fos at a later timepoint. I hypothesize that DOCA will increase\nthe expression of tdTomato and c-Fos in non-denervated mice, and that afferent renal denervation (ARDN) and\nan IL-1 receptor antagonist will both attenuate the DOCA-induced neuronal activity. The expected outcomes of\nthis proposal are to have traced the terminals of ARNs from the kidney to central primary processing centers and\nidentified changes in neuronal activation in central autonomic centers relevant for ARN processing. These results\nwill expand the understanding of how ARNs are involved in salt-induced HTN and establish an anatomical\nfoundation for future investigations into the physiological roles of ARNs in the autonomic control of BP regulation.\nFurther, these findings may contribute to the potential mechanism by which ARDN attenuates increased BP in\nsalt-induced HTN allowing the development of interventions that can more accurately target ARNs, both\nperipherally and centrally, increasing the therapeutic potential of ARDN as a treatment for hypertension.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nWest Nile virus is a pathogen of global concern. Since its introduction to the US in 1999, it has caused thousands\nof deaths and tens of thousands of hospitalizations. West Nile virus is transmitted to humans by the bite of\ninfected mosquitos; the virus mediates a febrile illness and can progress to invasive infection of the central\nnervous system causing severe encephalopathy. WNV neuroinvasive disease also causes cognitive and motor\nsequelae that can last for months or years after the virus is cleared. In order to successfully treat these\nsymptoms, gaining a clearer understanding of the immune response to WNV and the factors that determine the\ninitiation and severity of neuroinvasive disease is critical. There is incomplete understanding of what virus and\nhost determinants control or mediate WNV neuroinvasion, how the immune response to WNV within the CNS is\ninitiated and regulated, and how the acute response to WNV influences long-term inflammatory sequelae of\nWNV encephalitis. The goal of the proposed studies is to address these knowledge gaps by gaining a molecular\nunderstanding of WNV neuroinvasion, CNS immunity, and inflammatory sequelae. We will do this by deploying\nnewly-developed unique mouse models, recombinant forms of WNV, and an array of single-cell and spatial\ntranscriptomic and epigenomic methods. First, we will define the cells that initiate the immune response to WNV\nin the periphery, and the targets of the cytokines produced by this response that control WNV neuroinvasion.\nSecond, we will define the signaling circuits by which WNV initiates and propagates inflammatory responses\nwithin the CNS. Third and finally, we will use a recombinant WNV strain expressing Cre recombinase to mark\nCNS cells that survive WNV infection and assess their contribution to persistent inflammatory sequelae that\npersist after WNV clearance. New understanding gained from the proposed studies will significantly advance our\nunderstanding of the determinants and consequences of WNV neuroinvasive disease, and will inform ongoing\nefforts to mitigate and ameliorate these consequences in human patients.",

These studies are highly relevant for HIV vaccine development. RhCMV/SIV elicits high frequency and\npersistent effector-differentiated T cell responses in diverse tissues. Using of this vaccine in the rhesus macaque\n(RM) model of Simian immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) infection has demonstrated superior efficacy against highly\npathogenic SIV challenge over conventional SIV vaccines (overall 59% of RhCMV/SIV vaccinated RM with\nabrogation of progressive SIV infection). The RhCMV/SIV vaccine response mediates early SIV intercept and\nreplication arrest followed by eventual viral clearance. Vaccine protection is mediated by an MHC-E-restricted\nimmune response of effector memory-differentiated CD8+ T cells unique to CMV-vector vaccination. We have\nrevealed also that interleukin (IL)-15 and the IL-15 response are correlates of protection by RhCMV/SIV\nvaccination. The IL-15 response is rapidly induced following vaccination, with low prevaccination baseline IL-15\nexpression/response in blood, followed by rapid induction of IL-15 response networks linked with vaccine\nprotection. This IL-15 dynamic serves as RhCMV/SIV vaccine efficacy outcome predictor. We have defined an\ninclusive whole blood predictive protective signature (wbPPTS) biomarker of RhCMV/SIV vaccine efficacy, and\nwe will monitor this wbPPTS across RM vaccina cohorts within vivo studies to define the molecular mechanisms\nof vaccine immune programming. We hypothesize that RhCMV/SIV vaccine and IL-15 together direct expression\nof specific gene networks across tissues and cells to program effective vaccine immunity and establish the\nwbPPTS biomarker signature of vaccine protection. To investigate this hypothesis we have designed our PPG\nwith two projects and three service cores including: Project 1. Systemic analysis of the origin and tissue effects\nof the 68-1 RhCMV/SIV vaccine efficacy-predictive whole blood transcriptomic signature; Project 2: Systems\nvaccinology of RhCMV/SIV and IL-15 mechanisms of immune programming; Core A, Administration, Core B,\nNonhuman primates, and Core C, Systems biology.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nChronic Low Back Pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and one of the most common\nreasons patients are prescribed opioids, despite their poor ability to improve function. LBP threatens our\neconomic health due to high rates of health care utilization and disability, our security due to high rates of\nmedical discharge from armed services, and our quality of life due to pain-related suffering, pain-associ-\nated opioid misuse, depression, and anxiety. The primary driver in 40% of all LBP cases is estimated to\nbe pain resulting from intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, referred to as discogenic LBP. Improved\nunderstanding of this degenerative process is needed to address this global problem. Epigenetic mecha-\nnisms, such as DNA methylation, dynamically regulate gene expression in response to local, systemic\nand environmental influences. However, very little is known about the role of DNA methylation in dis-\ncogenic LBP. This application will address this knowledge gap by determining the role of DNA methyla-\ntion in the pathological expression of genes involved in IVD degeneration and discogenic LBP.\nOur central hypothesis is that widespread and persistent reprogramming of gene expression by DNA\nmethylation drives IVD degeneration and can be targeted for the treatment of discogenic LBP. Since\nDNA methylation is potentially a mechanism underlying the chronicity of pain, elucidation of the role of\nDNA methylation in IVD degeneration is likely to provide a strong scientific framework for innovative new\ntreatment approaches for discogenic LBP. In Aim 1 we will identify the DNA methylation and gene ex-\npression landscape of IVD degeneration and discogenic LBP in humans. In Aim 2, we will identify the\nDNA methylation and gene expression landscape of IVD degeneration and discogenic LBP in animal\nmodels and delineate correlated DNA methylation and gene expression profiles. In Aim 3, we will explore\nthe role of DNA methylation on IVD degeneration and discogenic LBP in animal models by manipulating\nmethylation using non-pharmacological (home cage voluntary running wheels) and pharmacological in-\nterventions.\nThese results will be significant because scientific evidence of a role for epigenetic reprogramming in IVD\ndegeneration and discogenic LBP may contribute to a paradigm shift in understanding, prevention, and\ntreatment of chronic LBP.",

These cell shape changes\nresult from physical and chemical feedback loops at multiple scales. At the biochemical scale, spatiotemporally\nvarying signaling cascades control cytoskeletal polymerization that pushes on the plasma membrane from the\ninside, inducing cell morphology change at the scale of micrometers. Cell morphology in turn feedbacks to alter\nintracellular signaling, via mechanisms such as surface curvature-sensing proteins in the plasma membrane.\nUnderstanding these feedbacks across scales is particularly critical since they are a target for pharmaceutical\nintervention. Scientists have developed a wealth of techniques for interrogating the biochemical and genetic\nbasis of cell function. However, disentangling the many feedback loops coupling cell morphology, intracellular\norganization, and spatiotemporally varying biochemical pathways, such as intracellular signaling, remains ex-\nperimentally challenging. Live-cell fluorescence microscopy can visualize these feedbacks in action, but imaging\nacross scales produces enormous and detailed datasets that are impossible to make sense of without dedicated\ncomputational pipelines. We will develop algorithms for cell biology rooted in computational geometry. Using\ncomputational geometry approaches will allow us to draw from decades of math and computer science research\nto work in biologically relevant geometries, increasing accuracy and easing interpretation. We propose to develop\nessential algorithms to reconstruct plasma membrane organization from 3D microscopy images and track its\nmovements across time. We will also measure the organizational rules that couple plasma membrane shape\nand dynamics to spatiotemporally varying biochemical pathways on the cell surface. Finally, we will focus on\nunderstanding feedbacks related to intracellular organization throughout the cell, not just on the plasma mem-\nbrane, by broadening the computational approaches we developed for the plasma membrane to other geome-\ntries. The computational methods that we are proposing to develop will aid in further opening up to scientific\ninvestigation the many feedback loops and physical interactions of the meso-scale world of subcellular organi-\nzation.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCardiomyopathy is classified into ischemic cardiomyopathy, caused by coronary artery disease, or non-\nischemic cardiomyopathy, caused by other factors. The current standard practice for diagnosing the cause of\ncardiomyopathy is to use coronary angiography to assess the presence or absence of coronary artery disease.\nHowever, this approach is flawed and may not always accurately identify the underlying cause of the\nmyocardial disease. Recent advancements in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging allow for a myocardial\napproach to identifying the cause of cardiomyopathy by directly visualizing myocardial abnormalities, including\ntissue damage. We hypothesize that a myocardial approach will reclassify the cause of cardiomyopathy in a\nclinically significant proportion of patients and improve the prediction of long-term outcomes. To test this\nhypothesis, we will use a large cohort of patients from an institutional registry of consecutive patients\nundergoing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for clinical reasons. Our study's anticipated results will\nprovide novel, large-scale data on the cause of cardiomyopathy and its long-term prognostic impact, clarifying\nthe extent of misclassification when using a coronary approach. This information will be essential to conduct a\nrandomized clinical trial comparing a myocardial approach to the coronary approach for identifying the cause of\ncardiomyopathy. More accurate recognition of the cause of cardiomyopathy will allow for increased use of\nappropriate cause-specific treatments, improving the long-term outcomes of patients. The study's results will\nbe relevant to the 1 million Americans diagnosed with heart failure and the several thousand others diagnosed\nwith cardiomyopathy without heart failure every year. The proposed work has a high potential to lead to\nimprovements in clinical practice and patient outcomes on a large scale.",

While the predominant clinical manifestation of severe\nCOVID-19 is respiratory failure, other organ complications such as cardiac injury are common. Cardiac injury\nand cardiomyopathy are frequent cardiac manifestations during acute illness. Additionally, some survivors of\nCOVID-19 are experiencing cardiopulmonary symptoms months after the acute illness, referred to as Post-\nAcute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or \u201cLong COVID\u201d. Given the frequency of cardiovascular injury during\nCOVID-19 and the persistence of symptoms for extended periods after the acute illness, there is an urgent\nneed for studies of the late effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the cardiovascular system. We aim to investigate the\ncentral hypothesis that immune responses to severe COVID-19 cause acute inflammation and injury that result\nin clinically relevant myocardial fibrosis and dysfunction over the long-term. Since August 2020, we have been\nenrolling patients in a COVID-19 Immune Profiling (IP) Study, which includes a protocol to collect blood\nspecimens from patients with COVID-19 at admission, during hospitalization, 1-3 months, and 3-12 months\nafter recovery. We will co-enroll participants from this study and perform cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\n(CMR) and additional functional cardiopulmonary assessments at 3-12 months and 2-3 years after recovery.\nOur specific aims include, Aim 1) Identify innate immune profiles during severe COVID-19 that predict long-\nterm cardiac damage. We will focus innate immunity measures in blood specimens collected at admission and\nearly recovery, Aim 2) Establish whether adaptive immune responses contribute to cardiac injury after COVID-\n19. We will quantify responses targeting SARS-CoV-2 as well as explore maladaptive responses targeting\ncardiac proteins. Analysis of blood specimens will be supplemented with exploratory studies of cardiac tissue,\nand Aim 3) Determine the long-term structural and functional cardiac abnormalities after severe COVID-19.\nThis includes characterization of cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, and clinical\nsymptoms. Comparisons will be made with control participants who had influenza infection 1-2 years prior. Our\nproposal responds to urgent need for science characterizing long-term cardiac complications following COVID-\n19. Our collaborative team has extensive experience spanning cardiology, infectious disease, immunology,\nand epidemiology, and will be led by a cardiologist with expertise in CMR and inflammatory cardiomyopathies,\nand an infectious diseases specialist with expertise in cardiovascular complications in the context of chronic\nviral infections. Successful completion of our work will help understand the long-term cardiovascular effects of\nsevere COVID-19 illness. This knowledge could, in turn, help enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness\nand disability in COVID-19 survivors.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nUnfortunately, ~20% of kidneys donated for transplant are discarded due to short storage viability (~24-36 h).\nCryopreservation decreases storage temperatures below -140oC, enabling storage of kidneys for months to\nyears. To re-warm cryopreserved kidneys without ice formation and cracking, fast and even warming is needed.\nFor this, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) can be perfused into them prior to cooling, then radiofrequency waves\ncan be applied to rapidly rotate their magnetic moments, causing local heating around IONPs and kidney re-\nwarming. Despite initial success of this method in rat kidneys, the complex behavior of IONPs (uneven particle\ndistribution, aggregation, etc.) limits reproducibility and is a major bottleneck in its translation to human organs.\nCurrently there is no low-cost method to nondestructively track IONPs in organs across concentrations of interest.\nThus, there is a need for precise monitoring of IONP concentrations (1) after perfusion, to ensure even IONP\ndistribution and therefore even kidney heating and viability, and (2) prior to transplant, to prevent potential IONP-\nrelated iron toxicity post-transplant. To address this, our lab has developed a low-cost, longitudinally detected\nelectron paramagnetic resonance (LOD-EPR) system that can directly detect electrons in IONPs. LOD-EPR is\nsensitive to IONP concentration in solution and in IONP-loaded kidney biopsies with improved accuracy in tissue\ncompared to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based on data under review. This project aims to develop\nLOD-EPR into an IONP quantification and imaging system for cryopreserved rat kidneys and compare\nits accuracy to similar techniques such as magnetic particle imaging, and micro-CT. Aim 1 will improve\nthe sensitivity of LOD-EPR through hardware changes on receive and transmit and increase the bore size to fit\nwhole rat kidneys. Aim 2 will develop the LOD-EPR system into an imaging system primarily by implementing\npermanent magnet-based linear gradients. Its IONP quantification accuracy and imaging resolution will be\ncompared to magnetic particle imaging and micro-CT in IONP-perfused whole rat kidneys. By enabling IONP\nmonitoring during the cryopreservation process, IONP synthesis, kidney perfusion, and radiofrequency heating\nparameters can be fully optimized for increased kidney viability during re-warming. This will ultimately expedite\ndevelopment of kidney cryopreservation to increase transplant availability.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nDiabetes and obesity in pregnancy cause abnormalities in placental development that underlie adverse\npregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, and stillbirth. Central to healthy placental\ndevelopment is cytotrophoblast differentiation into syncytiotrophoblasts that can be disrupted by diabetes and\nobesity by yet unknown mechanisms. Syncytiotrophoblasts facilitate nutrient transport, gas exchange, and\nhormone synthesis to support the pregnancy, and their differentiation depends on a highly coordinated\nprogression of metabolic, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming events. Mitochondrial flux of glucose\nand glutamine has emerged as a major factor regulating cellular development, and our initial work shows that\nthese metabolites play distinctive roles in cellular metabolism and gene expression during trophoblast\ndifferentiation. Glucose primarily fuels citrate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate production in rapidly dividing\ncytotrophoblasts, while glutamine is the main source in terminally differentiated syncytiotrophoblasts. This shift\nis linked to reduced expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) in syncytiotrophoblasts, while\nmitochondrial glutamine transporter (SLC1A5var) expression remains stable. In this proposal, we will test the\ncentral hypothesis that glucose-derived pyruvate and glutamine flux through the mitochondrial pyruvate\n(MPC) and glutamine (SLC1A5var) carriers, respectively, distinctly regulate energetic, epigenetic and\ntranscriptional reprogramming necessary for trophoblast differentiation. For the proposed experiments, we will\nuse CRISPR-Cas9 genetic tools to manipulate expression of MPC (Aim 1) or SLC1A5var (Aim 2) in human\ntrophoblast stem cell (TSC) models. In these lines, we will measure key indices of cellular metabolism using\nrespirometry and state-of-the-art, high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS)-based\nquantitative and 13C stable isotope tracing metabolomics methodologies. Moreover, we will examine genome-\nwide and locus-specific histone (H3) acetylation and methylation changes through integrative analysis of\nCUT&Tag- and RNAseq datasets. Both biochemical and morphologic differentiation will be characterized in\nMPC or SLC1A5var loss of function or overexpressing TSCs. Additionally, in parallel experiments we will\nemploy inhibitors of MPC and glutaminase in primary human trophoblasts to support key findings in TSCs.\nSuccessful completion of study aims will reveal novel, nutrient-responsive mechanisms controlling epigenetic\nand transcriptional reprogramming events that are foundational to trophoblast differentiation. Defining these\nfundamental pathways is a necessary first step for developing new, evidence-based approaches that fine-tune\nplacental fuel use and improve placental development and pregnancy outcomes for women with co-morbid\nobesity and diabetes.",

There are several genetic subtypes of XP-CS, including one associated with pathogenic variants\nin the gene ERCC5 (XPG).

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nMore than 40% of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) are refractory to direct intraocular injection of anti-\nVEGF antibodies, the standard of care. The inability to effectively treat DR puts a heavy burden on the health\ncare system and limits the quality of life for those affected. The need for novel, clinically relevant targets that can\nbe exploited for new therapies is very clear. Diabetes is well-known to induce retinal mitochondrial dysfunction\nthat leads to DNA damage and cytosolic release. Cytosolic DNA activates the cGAS-STING pathway, inducing\ninflammation. Although the cGAS-STING signaling axis is essential for sensing foreign DNA and thus\ncontributing to innate immunity, aberrant activation of this pathway by self-DNA is a significant contributor to\nautoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Activation of cGAS-STING due to chronic diabetes-induced\ninflammation leads to activation of circulating monocytes, eventually giving rise to leukostasis. Leukostasis\ncauses cell death and breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, leading to retinal vascular leakage, a major cause\nof diabetic macular edema and leading cause of vision loss in diabetic patients. We have shown that 1) the\ncGAS-STING pathway is activated in ischemic retinopathy; 2) inhibition of STING attenuates monocyte activation\nand alleviates retinal leukostasis and angiogenesis; 3) STING knockout significantly reduces retinal leakage,\nnumber of leukocytes in the retina, and DR relevant inflammatory factors in an oxygen-induced retinopathy\nmurine model; and 4) small molecule agonism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa)\ninhibits the cGAS-STING signaling axis and cytosolic mitochondrial DNA release. The objective of this\nexploratory R21 proposal is to assess two mechanistically differentiated approaches to inhibit STING with\nbifunctional small molecules in the context of DR. In Aim 1 we will assess small molecule induced STING\ndegradation through proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as a strategy for STING inhibition in the context\nof DR. The PROTAC strategy is unexplored in the eye but especially well-suited for ocular conditions. In Aim 2\nwe will leverage our success in developing selective PPARa agonists as new therapeutic leads for DR to develop\nfirst-in-class bifunctional probes that simultaneously agonize PPARa (neuronal protection) and inhibit STING\n(retinal vascular homeostasis and inflammation) to explore the potential benefits of polypharmacology in retinal\ndisease. The heterobifunctional modulators of these two targets are expected to provide a spatiotemporal benefit\naffecting multiple cell types and pathological events. This work is conceptually and technically innovative and is\nexpected to provide the fundamental data needed to enable proof-of-concept for the PROTAC and multi-action\ncompound strategies in ocular contexts (new approaches), a foundation for targeting STING in DR and related\nretinal diseases (new target), and new compounds poised for biological and translational initiatives, respectively.\nThis project leverages a long-standing and productive collaboration leveraging expertise in medicinal chemistry\nand biochemistry to advance knowledge regarding STING biology and therapeutic utility in DR.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nApproximately 1 in 3 children in the US experience neglect and/or abuse (\u201cmaltreatment\u201d) before they turn 18\nyears old, with marginalized racial and ethnic communities and young children facing the greatest risks. For the\npast century, research has treated maltreatment largely as a failing of individual parents, despite robust\nevidence that maltreatment risk, particularly for neglect and physical abuse, is powerfully shaped by structural\ndeterminants such as poverty and stress. Population-level maltreatment prevention could have major public\nhealth impacts, but it is not yet clear how to prevent maltreatment at scale. Emerging research suggests that\neconomic and social welfare policies that alleviate financial hardship and reduce stressors for families could\npotentially serve as population-level prevention interventions. However, two major gaps limit the utility of the\nexisting evidence base for identifying policies with the potential to prevent maltreatment. First, prior research\nhas evaluated individual policies one at a time without accounting for the ways that changes in one safety net\npolicy may affect the eligibility for and benefits from others. This failure to account for policy interactions may\nresult in mis-estimation of overall safety net benefits and mis-attribution of effects of one policy to another.\nSecond, prior research has almost exclusively assessed maltreatment through Child Protective Services (CPS)\ninvolvement (e.g., reports of maltreatment to CPS), and thus impacts on other critical public health outcomes\nsuch as maltreatment-related injuries remain unknown. The overarching goal of this research is to identify the\nimpact of social safety net policies on CPS reports and injuries related to neglect and physical abuse in young\nchildren. Two key innovations will directly address current knowledge gaps. First, to estimate benefits from\neach major social safety net program (EITC, CTC, SSI, TANF, SNAP/WIC, and Medicaid/CHIP), accounting for\nother programs, we will use and expand a safety net benefits calculator. This calculator sequentially applies\nprogram rules for each state and year, allowing benefits from one program (e.g., TANF) to be incorporated into\neligibility and benefits estimates for others (e.g., SNAP), as dictated by program rules. Second, we will\ncombine and harmonize over 300 state-years of data on ED and inpatient visits for pediatric injuries that are\nhighly correlated with maltreatment. We will estimate the impact of social safety net policies on these\nmaltreatment-related injuries in addition to CPS reports. We will focus on young children (aged <5 years) as\nthey are at greatest risk of maltreatment. We will also examine these outcomes by race and ethnicity to\ndetermine impacts on equity. The aims of our research are to: (1) Estimate the effect of major social safety net\npolicies (EITC, CTC, SSI, TANF, SNAP/WIC, Medicaid/CHIP) on CPS reports of neglect and physical abuse in\nyoung children (age <5 years), overall and by race and ethnicity; and (2) Estimate the effect of major social\nsafety net policies (EITC, CTC, SSI, TANF, SNAP/WIC, Medicaid/CHIP) on neglect- and physical abuse-\nrelated hospitalizations in young children (age <5 years), overall and by race and ethnicity.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Diabetes is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic poor glycemic control, resulting in\npathological changes in tissues throughout the body. Chronic hyperglycemia causes the cardiovascular system\nto undergo growth and remodeling (G&R) that is captured hypertension and increased arterial stiffness, both\nsignificant risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Diabetes results in both cellular and matrix changes in arterial\nhealth, and then each of these components further drive the pathological G&R by responding to the direct effects\nof the disease. Fortunately, there exist medical and lifestyle interventions to help mitigate the diabetic disease\nstate and restore glycemic control. Large elastic arteries like the aorta serve as capacitors to absorb changes in\nblood volume due to pulsatile pumping and protect the more fragile downstream microvasculature. Overall health\nand stiffness of these large vessels is captured in the clinic via pulse wave velocity which is elevated in diabetic\npatients, and there is evidence that the pulse wave velocity decreases back towards baseline following\nrestoration of glycemic control. The overarching objective of this project is to determine how hyperglycemia\naffects aortic biomechanics and mechanobiology and whether restoration of normoglycemia is sufficient to\nreverse these changes. To establish how arterial biomechanics are affected by hyperglycemia, I first employed\na diabetic mouse model to ascertain changes in active and passive wall mechanics, and these preliminary results\ndemonstrate that chronic hyperglycemia results in stiffer and hypercontractile murine aortas. The central\nhypothesis of this proposal is that chronic hyperglycemia results in cellular and matrix aortic G&R, and glycemic\nrecovery results in reversal of the cellular, but not matrix, phenotype, leading to partial rescue of aortic health.\nTo test this hypothesis, I will utilize an inducible mouse model of chronic hyperglycemia that can subsequently\nbe rescued by administration of Phloridzin. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will determine the in vivo and ex vivo\nbiomechanical changes in aortic health due to hyperglycemia and following treatment. Aim 2 will then explore\nhow the tissue-scale mechanical changes arise by investigating how the matrix composition and cellular\nphenotype are affected by the disease and treatment. The experimental work of the first two Aims will be coupled\nwith a multiscale, bio-chemo-mechanical computational model of aortic G&R in Aim 3. The computational model\nwill provide mechanistic insight into the roles of cells and matrix in disease progression and possible regression,\nresolving information that is inextricable experimentally. Collectively, these data will elucidate aortic G&R due to\nchronic hyperglycemia, whether these changes can be reversed by restoration of glycemic control, and the\nmechanisms behind these processes. This proposed work will have broad implications in the conceptual\nunderstanding of the cellular and matrix roles in diabetes-related cardiovascular pathologies and the\ndevelopment of methodologies to explore biomechanical and mechanobiological changes in vascular health due\nto disease and treatment.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nFreezing of gait (FOG) is characterized by episodes during which an individual is unable to step, despite\nintending to do so, and is a common cause of falls, decreased mobility, and increased morbidity in people with\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Effective treatment for FOG remains elusive, due to a lack of understanding of the\ncomplex underlying pathophysiology. The expression and factors contributing to FOG are highly\nheterogeneous across individuals, however, a common feature is that episodes are predominantly triggered\nduring movement-state transitions (e.g. initiating walking or turning)4,5. Impaired transitions leading to FOG\ntypically occur when the change in movement-state is self-initiated (uncued), but when the same transition is\ncued by an external sensory stimulus, movement execution is improved, and the incidence and duration of\nFOG is markedly reduced. FOG may be caused by abnormal communication between subcortical systems\ncontrolling posture and balance (e.g. vestibulo- and reticulospinal systems) and cortico-fugal systems driving\nthe initiation of the intended action (e.g. stepping). Currently, the mechanisms contributing to impaired\nself-initiated movement transitions in people with PD and FOG, and how they are improved by external cues,\nare poorly understood. We hypothesize that the capacity to downregulate the communication (coherence) of\nsystems controlling posture and balance during self-initiated transitions from one movement state (standing) to\nanother (walking) is impaired in people with FOG, and that sensory cues ameliorate FOG by restoring\ntransition-related modulation of posture/balance systems. This hypothesis will be tested using biomechanical\nand neurophysiological measures to examine the dynamics of the vestibulo-postural (Aim 1), cortico-cortical\nand cortico-muscular (Aim 2), and cortico-basal ganglia (Aims 3 and 4) systems during cued and uncued\nposture-locomotion transitions in PD, with and without FOG, and controls. Aim 1 will examine the\nvestibulo-postural system in FOG by measuring the dynamic changes in coherence between vestibular input\n(electrical vestibular stimulation) and the ground reaction forces controlling balance. Aim 2 will utilize\nhigh-resolution electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to examine movement-related\ncortical potentials and cortico-cortical and cortico-muscular coherence. Aim 3 will use EEG and local field\npotential (LFP) recordings from implanted Medtronic PerceptTM deep brain stimulators (DBS) to examine the\ninteraction of the globus pallidus and cortex (cortico-pallidal coherence). Aims 1-3 will utilize standardized gait\ninitiation paradigms that may or may not provoke freezing. Aim 4 will use wearable sensors and a\nFOG-provoking course, involving multiple posture/gait transitions, to wirelessly capture LFPs associated with\nFOG episodes in participants with PD with the PerceptTM DBS system. This project will provide insight into the\nmechanisms and neurological biomarkers of FOG, which will be critical for the development of interventions to\nreduce the incidence and severity of FOG, reduce falls, and improve the quality of life of people with PD.",

    "abstract_text": "Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section \nBoth genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Hyperinsulinemia is commonly seen among pregnant women with prediabetes, obesity, and gestational diabetes, and their offspring has a greater risk for developing T2D. Yet, no current study addresses the long-term/longitudinal metabolic outcomes of the offspring when the mother is hyperinsulinemic. Furthermore, the mechanistic link between maternal hyperinsulinemia and the programming of metabolic disease in the offspring remains largely unknown. The dogma is that insulin does not cross the placenta into the fetus to regulate fetal growth. However, maternal insulin can act as a growth factor and an anabolic hormone binding to the placental insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) to drive critical placental function, including nutrient flux to the fetus. Thus, maternal insulin can change placental function by altering nutrient availability to fetal metabolic tissues causing permanent changes that predispose the offspring to T2D in adulthood. Indeed, we have compelling preliminary data showing increased body weight and glucose intolerance in the offspring of hyperinsulinemic dams. We identified that placental-specific IR deletion has a beneficial effect in improving glucose tolerance in the offspring of hyperinsulinemic dams. These observations provide a strong premise that the placenta integrates maternal hyperinsulinemia signals with placental nutrient flux to the growing fetus, thereby programming the metabolic health of the offspring. In this grant, we will test the main hypothesis that the increased body weight and glucose intolerance programming in the offspring by maternal hyperinsulinemia is caused by increased placental nutrient flux to the fetus, which is mediated by increased IR and IGF1R signaling and their downstream targets, mTOR and GLUT4, in the placenta. To test this hypothesis, we developed new innovative models of maternal hyperinsulinemia with or without placental IR or IGF1R deletion, to leverage and obtain a detailed in vivo mechanistic approach of metabolic and physiological studies in a longitudinal cohort of offspring. In Aim 1, we will define long-term metabolic outcomes and signaling mechanisms whereby maternal hyperinsulinemia regulates metabolic health of the offspring using functional studies with preclinical genetic models of maternal hyperinsulinemia during pregnancy with or without placenta-specific loss of IR, IGF1R, IR/IGF1R compound or mTOR. In Aim 2, we will determine maternal-to-fetal nutrient flux in the offspring with or without placenta-specific insulin-signaling or GLUT4 deficiencies. These mechanistic studies are highly significant because they will define the molecular mechanisms whereby maternal hyperinsulinemia impacts metabolic health, and they underscore the importance of clinically controlling insulin levels during pregnancy, similar to glucose, to improve pregnancy outcomes. Thus, the anticipated success of this project will have significant implications in improving women\u2019s reproductive health and the metabolic health of the offspring.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nHealthcare and research organizations, including the American Society for Clinical Oncology, acknowledge the\ncommon use of stigmatizing language in cancer care. However, stigmatizing language has not been\ncomprehensively defined, and drivers and outcomes of this language use have not been investigated in cancer\ncare. One way that discrimination and stigma manifest in the healthcare system is through the electronic health\nrecord (EHR), which can reflect the author\u2019s implicit and explicit bias. Reading stigmatizing language alters\nreaders\u2019 clinical decisions in vignette studies. Thus, there is an opportunity to evaluate EHR stigmatizing\nlanguage as a modifiable mechanism of decreasing discrimination and improving outcomes in cancer care.\nThe long-term goal is to evaluate sociocultural and healthcare system influences of EHR stigmatizing language\nand resulting changes in clinical decision-making in cancer care. The central hypothesis is that stigmatizing\nlanguage is present in the cancer care EHR, inequitably experienced, and associated with altered clinical\ndecision-making. The hypothesis will be tested via the following specific aims: (1) Determine the categories of\nstigmatizing language used by oncology clinicians when documenting patient encounters in the EHR; (2)\nCompare stigmatizing language in the cancer care EHR by patient and clinician characteristics; (3) Determine\nif stigmatizing language use is associated with disparities in medication prescription for cancer-related pain.\nThis study will leverage EHR data from a large academic and community healthcare system in Minnesota. Aim\n1 utilizes a qualitative study design to perform a directed content analysis of the unstructured, free text section\nof outpatient oncology EHR notes. Aims 2 & 3 use natural language processing to abstract stigmatizing terms\nand phrases for each individual with outpatient cancer visits in 2022. Multilevel models will be utilized to\naccount for nested visit-level data within patient-level data within clinician-level data. This project is innovative\nin its characterization and modeling of stigmatizing language in cancer care and will have significant impact by\ninforming interventions to reduce stigma, health disparities, and resulting negative health outcomes. By\nfocusing on EHR stigmatizing language, this project addresses emerging opportunities and challenges as\nmedical records become accessible to patients and persist throughout their lives. The applicant is an MD/PhD\nand Epidemiology PhD student at the University of Minnesota Schools of Medicine and Public Health. By\nexpanding content knowledge in cancer survivorship and disparities, rigorous qualitative and quantitative\nanalysis skills, tailored clinical training, and focused professional development opportunities, this fellowship will\nenhance her ability to excel in the MD/PhD program and become an independent academic physician-\nepidemiologist.",

    "abstract_text": "RESEARCH SUMMARY\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by the inability to control or stop the use of alcohol, even in the\nface of negative consequences or after long-term abstinence. Thus, it is important to understand the risk\nfactors that contribute to this loss of control such as environmental cues that can contribute to an increase in\nprobability of relapse, compulsive drinking, and withdrawal symptoms after abstinence. Previous research has\nshown that ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons can modify the learned value of reward-\nassociated cues to alter reward-seeking behavior by driving an increase cue reactivity and cue-driven reward-\nseeking. It is also known that VTA DA neuron activity increases compulsive alcohol seeking and cue-induced\nrelapse of alcohol seeking. However, which receptors control the activity of VTA DA neurons on cue-related\nbehaviors have yet to be determined. Systemic GABAB receptor activation is shown to reduce the mentioned\nalcohol-related behaviors in rodents in addition to reducing the ability of cues to reinstate alcohol seeking.\nBaclofen, a direct GABAB receptor agonist, has been shown to have a dose-related reduction in these\nbehaviors while related studies showed that the VTA was implicated as baclofen\u2019s key site of action due to\nintra-VTA injections having suppression of cue-elicited reward seeking in rats. Yet, the specific neuronal\npopulations in the VTA responsible for baclofen\u2019s effects remain unknown. Thus, the broad goal is of the\nproposal is test the significance of a potential molecular target from a reward-related neuron population on\nalcohol cue reactivity, cue-evoked aversion-resistant drinking and relapse plus on baclofen\u2019s seen effects.\nThe objective of this proposal is to investigate the impact of deleting GABAB receptors in VTA DA neurons on\ncue-evoked relapse (Aim 1) and aversion-resistant drinking (Aim 2). Additionally, to test the role of these\nreceptors on the previously seen effects of baclofen with the addition of intra-VTA microinjections of baclofen.\nGiven that these receptors and neuron population have been shown to influence these behaviors in rodents, I\nhypothesize that GABAB receptors in VTA dopaminergic neurons are responsible for constraining the\ncue-elicited alcohol-related behaviors and for the previously seen baclofen induced effects. To test this,\nI will use the cutting-edge CRISPR-Cas9 approach by bilaterally microinjecting high-titer AAV viral vectors\nharboring guide RNAs targeting GABAB receptors or control (Rosa), and a Cre-dependent GFP for visualizing\nexpression (Experiment 1A and 2A). Additionally, a separate subject group will also have a bilateral guide\ncannula implant for intra-VTA baclofen delivery (Experiment 1B and 2B). Following this, the aforementioned\nbehaviors will be tested and an analysis of lever presses and g per kg of alcohol consumed will take place.\nThat said, during this proposal I will gain valuable technical and theoretical training in genetic manipulation,\nbehavioral methods, histological processing, imaging techniques, intracranial surgeries, and computational\nanalysis. Therefore, allowing me to become a successful independent addiction neuroscientist.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nNatural killer (NK) cell engagers are a promising anticancer therapy that potently leverages the immune system\nwhile providing an exceptional safety profile. Trispecific killer cell engagers (TriKEs) are NK cell engagers that\nmediate NK cell killing of tumor cells through multispecific binding. TriKEs contain a tumor binding domain, an\nIL-15 cytokine, and a CD16 engager. The IL-15 and CD16 engager stimulate robust NK cell activation and\ntumor cell killing while the tumor binding domain targets the therapy to the tumor microenvironment. Expansion\nof the TriKE platform to target new tumor-associated antigens requires integration of novel TriKE tumor binding\ndomains. This process is bottlenecked by difficulties preserving TriKE functionality and developability (i.e.\nsufficient stability, aggregation, and recombinant yield for therapeutic use) upon the addition of a new tumor\nbinding domain. This project will transform the TriKE discovery process by interrogating the impact of\nspecific tumor binding domain properties on the resultant TriKE\u2019s functionality and developability,\nincluding use of innovative hyperstable miniproteins. Specifically, Aim 1 will investigate the impact of\ntumor binder scaffold architecture by comparing the performance of several different scaffolds within TriKEs,\nincluding antibody fragments and hminiproteins. Aim 2 will investigate the impact of preemptively optimizing\ntumor binder stability and recombinant yield before insertion into TriKEs. This will be accomplished by\nsystematically varying tumor binder stability and recombinant yield and quantifying the impact on TriKE\nfunctionality and developability. These investigations will involve the production and characterization of\nexperimental tumor binding domains and TriKEs targeting B7-H3, an established tumor-associated antigen.\nThe primary goal of this work is to inform the design of TriKE tumor targeting domains, thereby streamlining the\nexpansion of the platform to new therapeutic targets. Furthermore, this project will advance the development of\nTriKEs as a therapeutic option for B7-H3 positive cancers.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nCutaneous viral infections, including vector-borne viruses, cause significant morbidity and mortality.\nVector-borne viruses are transmitted first to the skin through mosquito bites, then disseminate, causing a broad\nspectrum of frequently devastating disease. Yet, strategies to thwart cutaneous viruses remain elusive.\nResident memory T cells (TRM) represent a promising target due to their potent effector functions and\nlocalization at barrier tissues including the skin. In contrast to recirculating memory T cells, TRM stably occupy\nnonlymphoid tissues (NLT) where they rapidly detect pathogen reinfection and initiate protective anamnestic\nimmune responses. In fact, skin TRM can provide complete protection against cutaneous challenge through\ndirect killing of infected cells and innate-like effector functions that establish an antiviral state. Extensive\npreliminary data supports the broad range of TRM functions that can be leveraged therapeutically. It is unknown,\nhowever, if skin TRM can be directed to limit viral spread in acute infection after targeted immunization. By\nfocusing on antiviral CD8 TRM populations in the skin, this proposal will identify TRM functions in host immunity\nthat may be harnessed against skin-borne infectious diseases. Building on preliminary data, Aim 1 will\ndetermine whether CD8 TRM reactivation orchestrates immune cells in the skin. Aim 2 will determine the extent\nto which skin TRM influence distal immunity. TRM must function from a fixed location, yet it is unclear if they are\nto serve as a local alarm or one that is amplified to enhance immunity at other sites. Observations that local\ninflammation has far-reaching effects on other tissues, creating a cascade of responses that heighten immunity\nat an organismal level lend credence to the idea TRM provoke systemic immune effects. By understanding how\nwe can utilize TRM through TCR-dependent processes, we may be able to wield this population in a more broad\nmanner. Given the many parallels between mouse and human TRM, findings in my studies using reductionist\nmouse models may readily be applied to clinical therapeutics.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a prominent neurodegenerative disease with over 90,000 cases being\ndiagnosed annually. Little is known about the pathogenesis of abnormal trunk posturing/impaired\npostural control in PD. Trunk postural control is particularly problematic during both standing (e.g.\nexcessive forward and lateral flexion) and turning (\u201cen bloc\u201d turning). Corticospinal, reticulospinal and\nvestibulospinal systems contribute to the control of trunk muscles, but their roles in the pathogenesis of\ndisordered trunk control are unclear. To date, no studies have investigated the function of descending\nneural pathways on the control of the trunk during static postures and dynamic movements in people\nwith PD. This proposal will use two noninvasive neuromodulation techniques, transcranial magnetic\nstimulation (TMS) and electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS), to characterize: (i) the excitability of\ncorticomotoneuronal (corticospinal and corticoreticulospinal) projections to trunk muscles during quasi-static\npostures and prior to turning, and (ii) the engagement of vestibulospinal projections during standing and\nturning. Aim 1: (A) Compare trunk muscle corticomotoneuronal and intracortical excitability (via TMS)\nin sitting and standing between people with PD and healthy controls. (B) Examine the relationships\nbetween TMS responses and quantitative assessments of posture and gait. Trunk muscle responses\nto single and paired-pulse TMS of the primary motor cortex trunk region will quantify the excitability of\ncorticomotoneuronal and intracortical (inhibition and facilitation) pathways in quasi-static postures (sitting\nand standing). Aim 2: (A) Compare the modulation of corticomotoneuronal pathway excitability to\ntrunk muscles (via TMS) immediately prior to turns in people with PD and healthy controls. Single\npulse TMS will quantify the change in excitability of corticomotoneuronal pathways immediately prior to a\n90\u00b0 turn. Aim 3: Compare the modulation of (A) EVS-ground reaction force (GRF) coherence and (B)\nEVS-trunk electromyograph (EMG) coherence prior to and during turns in people with PD and healthy\ncontrols. Vestibulo-postural coupling will be tested by computing the coherence between EVS and the (A)\nGRFs used to maintain balance and (B) surface EMG from the trunk muscles. This work will provide novel\ninsight into the pathophysiology of disordered trunk control in PD. This proposed study is part of a fellowship\ntraining plan that will include training in (i) quantitative motor assessments using biomechanical and EMG\ntechniques, (ii) clinical neurophysiological and neuromodulation techniques, and (iii) professional\ndevelopment skills that are essential for a successful career as a rehabilitation scientist. The University of\nMinnesota\u2019s expansive research infrastructure, the multi-disciplinary Program in Rehabilitation Science, and\nthe Movement Disorders Laboratory create an ideal environment for completing this research and training.",

Existing research has shown that proximity to providers confers advantages in frequency\nof care and better health outcomes. However, partially attributable to the availability of adequate datasets,\nthese studies have only examined the role of distance as it relates to cancer incidence rather than post-\ntreatment survivorship. For CCS, and especially adolescent and young adults (AYA), survivors\u2019 communication\nbetween and/or fluctuation of care providers adds complexity to sustained healthcare treatment across the life\ncourse.\nAims: This project will (1) characterize the proximity of AYA survivors to Children\u2019s Oncology Group (COG)\nsurvivorship care across the US, (2) determine the association between distance to care and early mortality,\nand examine whether this is influenced by socioeconomic status (SES) and/or race/ethnicity in AYA survivors.\nApproach: The proposed secondary analysis will leverage AYA cancer patient data from the COG\u2019s Children\u2019s\nCancer Research Network (protocol #ACCRN07). Previous work to geocode patient residence and complete\n(pre- and post-diagnosis) residential history has allowed for study of patient residence in relation to\nsurvivorship care. Aim 1 analysis will measure distance to care and characterize patients\u2019 residential\nenvironment (individual- and area-level characteristics). Poisson regression will be used to assess the number\nof survivorship care contacts per unit area (density). Aim 2 will assess the relationship between distance to\ncare and early mortality (<5 years post-diagnosis) using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age\nand sex. Mediation analysis will be used to explore the influence of SES and we will evaluate race/ethnicity as\na confounder.\nFellowship Information: The applicant is a PhD student in Epidemiology at the University of Minnesota and a\npredoctoral trainee in the NICHD-funded T32 training program in Population Health Science. Through\ncoursework and mentoring on pediatric cancer epidemiology, geospatial analysis, and health disparities along\nwith guidance on communicating findings and writing grants, the proposed training plan will build on Ms.\nThomas\u2019 existing research skills. This training will enhance her ability to complete her dissertation research\nand become an independent cancer epidemiology researcher with expertise in childhood cancer survivorship.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nWhile expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage over the past two decades has significantly decreased\nmother-to-child, or \u201cvertical,\u201d transmission, progress has stagnated in recent years. To address the remaining\n130,000 new infections among children each year, we must take a broader approach, promoting maternal ART\ncoverage within the context of additional interventions. The key question is, which additional interventions\nwill most benefit elimination of mother-to-child transmission (eMTCT) efforts while also being\neconomically feasible for a country to implement? Simulation-based modeling and decision science have\nplayed an important role in evaluating the benefits and costs of HIV treatment and prevention strategies, in order\nto inform guidelines and policy decisions. We propose to apply these methods to guide eMTCT health policy in\nsub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of infant infections occur. Most decision science work in this area has\nfocused on adult HIV, while the limited number of eMTCT studies have largely focused on interventions\ndownstream of ART initiation, despite the potential for interventions upstream of ART initiation to have significant\nimpact. We have identified an eMTCT toolbox of six interventions that span the entire reproductive continuum,\nfrom preconception to postpartum: access to contraception to more safely time pregnancies, pre-exposure\nprophylaxis to prevent HIV infection among pregnant and breastfeeding women (PBFW), HIV re-testing to\nensure prompt ART initiation among PBFW who acquire HIV, and long-acting ART, mentor mother programs,\nand viral load testing to increase viral suppression rates among PBFW who initiate ART. Implementing all six\ninterventions at full-scale is ideal but not feasible given resource limitations. To identify implementation priorities,\nwe will evaluate the population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each of these interventions, alone\nand in different combinations or \u201cportfolios\u201d of various sizes. Because the cost-effectiveness and affordability of\nan intervention will depend on country-specific factors, including economic resources, demographics, epidemic\ncharacteristics, and eMTCT progress to date, we will tailor our evaluation to the specific country contexts of\nKenya, Nigeria, and Botswana. These three African countries all have a high HIV burden but also represent\ndiversity in key relevant characteristics, making them useful case studies for a wide range of other African\ncountries. Our findings from this comprehensive eMTCT intervention analysis will provide urgently-needed\nsupport for eMTCT policymaking in each of our three focus countries, paving the way for a new frontier in eMTCT\nprogress in these and other African settings.",

The introduction of generic DTG to RLS raises new questions\nabout optimum clinical management for people living with HIV for whom DTG-based regimens are failing.\nConducting furtherclinicalresearch can informand improve HIV treatment guidelines; however, research funding\nresources are limited. Thus, it is important that methods for setting funding prioritie s maximize the potential\ndownstream health benefits of research. The proposed K01 will leverage an individual-based HIV epidemiologic\nstochastic model, developed by Dr. Duarte, for a Kenyan adult (15 years and older) population. This project\u2019s\nresearch aims (R1-3) are to: R1) Given currently available data, evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of drug\nresistance testing to inform choice of second-line ART for patients with unsuppressed viral load on DTG-based\nART; R2) Calculate the maximum potential returns on investment to be expected from further research related\nto managing virologic failure on DTG-based ART and identify which research studies have the greatest potential\nhealth benefit; and R3) Calculate the optimal sample size for potential key clinical studies identified in Aim 2.\nThe research aims of this study will provide Dr. Duarte the opportunity to pursue his training aims ( T1-4),\nincluding: T1) Develop expertise in Bayesian theory and methods for model parameterization and calibration,\nconducting VOI analyses, and designing clinical studies; T2) Develop expertise in VOI analysis, including\nstatistical methods for meta-model development; T3) Develop expertise in using open-source decision analysis\nmethods, including data visualization tools; and T4) Understand the methodologic and pragmatic aspects of\nclinical study design, and develop relationships with stakeholders in Kenya and other RLS, in order to build\nresearch collaborations. These research and training goals will provide Dr. Duarte with valuable expertise that\nis applicable to a wide range of important health policy issues relevant to HIV, as well as other infectious disease\nchallenges, thereby preparing him to transition to independence. He will plan to submit an R01 grant focused on\ninforming the prioritization and design of clinical research to improve pediatric and maternal HIV health outcomes\nin RLS. This R01 will leverage the expertise Dr. Duarte gains through the proposed K01 and combine it with his\nongoing, pilot grant-funded work building simulation models for pediatric and maternal HIV-affected populations.\nDr. Duarte will complete his K01 career development training at the University of Washington, which provides\nan outstanding environment for training in computational methods and applying them to global health issues, as\nthe university has a strong >25-year history of collaboration with Kenyan institutions.",

Cryptococcal meningitis causes 15-19% of AIDS-related deaths, and TB-meningitis is the\ndeadliest form of tuberculosis (TB). These CNS infections are neglected diseases.\n This K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research proposal seeks to continue a\nsuccessful clinical and translational research portfolio in humans with CNS infections to impact the\ninternational guidelines for what is the standard of medical care in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.\nThe research portfolio includes leading and mentoring clinical cohorts and randomized clinical trials on: 1)\nFDA-field trials for meningitis diagnostics; 2) meningitis treatment; 3) optimizing supportive care for CNS\ninfections; 4) preventing cryptococcosis; 5) exploring immunopathogenesis in humans relative to survival and\n6) neurocognitive outcomes; as well as 7) using health economics to inform international and US policy.\n This proposal is submitted by a mid-career investigator focused on improving the diagnosis, treatment, and\nprevention of neuro-infections. In 16 years as a faculty, the candidate has mentored >60 students, trainees,\nand junior faculty. Current mentees include: 6 K-awardees, 1 Wellcome Trust PhD fellow, 1 MD/PhD student,\n12 under-represented minorities, as well as MD and MPH students. The candidate serves as program director\nfor a T32 training award for infectious diseases fellows. Since 2019, the K24 candidate has published 163\nmanuscripts (NIH iCite RCR mean = 3.47, ~85th percentile), reflective of effective leadership of a highly\nproductive interdisciplinary meningitis research team conducting relevant research. The K24 seeks to continue\na productive research platform for HIV-related neuro-infections, which are neglected diseases. There is a track\nrecord of creativity, innovation, and pursuit of clinically relevant research which impacts clinical care in the U.S.\nand abroad to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and survival of those persons living with HIV.\n Specific Aims are: 1) Enroll a prospective cohort of HIV+ persons with meningitis to enable diagnostic field\ntrials and mentee substudies; 2) Develop new clinical trial protocols to investigate new agents for cryptococcal\nmeningitis and TB meningitis; 3) Develop immunologic framework to characterize distinct subsets of AIDS-\nrelated neuro-infections in the setting of HIV therapy with a focus on future host directed therapy.\n Training objectives of this K24 include 1) further refinement of leadership skills to lead a multi-disciplinary\nteam; 2) developing further mentoring skills through formal training and workshops; 3) developing proficiency in\nsingle-cell RNA-sequencing to better characterize CSF immune responses.",

This D43 training program builds upon an existing, successful\nmultidisciplinary research partnership focused on CNS infectious diseases which has been ongoing\nsince 2005, particularly in the realm of HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis and TB meningitis. This new\napplication proposes a Minnesota-Makerere-Mbarara training program in Uganda for neuro-infectious\ndiseases with multidisciplinary training in clinical research, biostatistics, epidemiology, immunology,\nmicrobiology, neurology, ophthalmology, pharmacology, and psychiatry.\n The meningitis research platform has in the past decade published >150 manuscripts, enabled 3\nUgandans to secure independent NIH research funding as a PI, facilitated funded PhD training for 6\nUgandans, as well as provided research projects and support for 16 Ugandan Master's students. We\nseek to continue this successful partnership and training portfolio through providing translational\nresearch training in the gap after Master's of Medicine (MMed) graduate medical training (i.e.\nequivalent to a U.S. graduate medical residency) and before PhD training or research faculty posts.\nWe propose a 2-3 year intensive mentored research experiences to publish Master's theses, gain new\nresearch skills, generate preliminary data for new projects, and apply for funded PhD training, research\ngrants, and/or faculty appointments.\nThe D43 training faculty draws on 19 primary research mentors of whom, 9 are Ugandan, and 10 are\nAmerican with a multinational training advisory committee overseeing the D43 program.\nSpecific Aim 1. Expand needed research expertise in Uganda in the areas of neuro-infectious\ndiseases by training at least 12 physician scientists. Post-graduate fellowships represent a current\ncareer gap between initial research experiences in MMed graduate medical training and future PhD\ntraining positions and/or faculty appointments.\nSpecific Aim 2. Build research capacity in Uganda through workshops and short-term training focused\non: scientific communication, leadership, research methodologies, clinical trial experiences, applied\nbiostatistics, and translational laboratory mentored research experiences in Uganda and with short term\nU.S. exchange visits, as needed.\nD43 Fellows will have the opportunity to gain clinical trial experience as well as implement nested\nresearch projects into ongoing investigator-initiated randomized clinical trials for cryptococcal\nmeningitis, TB meningitis, or advanced HIV disease.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\n In Sub-Saharan Africa, tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the second most common cause of adult\nmeningitis, and a major cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV. While host immuno-\ndeficiency clearly drives TBM pathogenesis, pathologic immune responses can also worsen disease. The key\ndrivers of HIV-associated TBM pathogenesis remain undefined but likely differ from HIV-negative TBM, thus a\nstudy of the pathogenesis of TBM in HIV-infected humans is warranted and innovative.\n Opportunities for host-directed therapy in this vulnerable population remain unexplored. To optimize\ntreatment of HIV/TBM and improve survival, it is critical to fully characterize host responses at the site of\ninfection and identify immune signatures associated with good or poor outcomes. To this challenge, we bring\nour skills in experimental immunology of tuberculosis, matched with an experienced research team with a\nproven track record of clinical and translational research regarding AIDS-related meningitis in Uganda.\n Diagnosing TBM is notoriously difficult. The poor sensitivity (~50%) of standard methodologies detects only\na subset of those with TBM, likely with the highest CSF bacillary burden. In these patients hypo-functional or\npathologic immune responses, representing opposite extremes of immune function, may contribute to poor\nhost control of infection. The higher sensitivity of Xpert Ultra enables semi-quantitative diagnosis of those with\na lower burden of CSF bacteria and identifies a group with better immune control of the infection. Our\npreliminary data suggest that diagnosis with trace or very low Xpert Ultra is associated with better survival.\n In this project, we propose a new microbiologic/immunologic framework for understanding TBM,\ncategorizing patients based on the differing Xpert Ultra PCR cycle-threshold, which serve as a surrogate for\nCSF bacterial burden. We seek to interrogate this framework by defining disease outcomes including survival\nand neurocognitive testing in these different framework groups, while correlating these findings with\nimmunologic analyses of cellular immune responses in the CSF.\n Our central hypothesis is that CSF immune signatures correlate with key aspects of TBM disease\npathogenesis including sensitivity of diagnostics, disease outcomes, and treatment responses. To test this, we\nwill perform high parameter spectral flow cytometry and multiplex cytokine profiling of samples from the CSF\nand autopsy specimens of patients with HIV/TBM. By comparing these comprehensive immunologic data in\ngroups of patients with either high or low CSF bacterial burden, in those with good or poor outcomes, and in\nthe context of a clinical trial of standard vs high dose rifampin treatment, we aim to define the key contributions\nof host immunity to TBM pathogenesis. If our hypothesis is correct, the implications of this research are that\nimmunomodulatory therapy will need to be customized to address the paucity or excess of immune responses.",

Although maternal milk is critically important to promote optimal health and\nneurodevelopment for preterm infants, the effects of maternal postnatal stress on maternal lactation and\nfeeding outcomes and milk composition have not been systematically examined. The goal of this proposed\nPathway to Independence Award is to pair a detailed examination of lactation and feeding outcomes for\npreterm infants in the NICU with a biological systems approach to understanding human milk to examine the\nhypothesis that maternal stress is associated with feeding outcomes and markers of impaired\nneurodevelopment for preterm infants and alters human milk and infant gut profiles in ways that affect preterm\nneurodevelopment. The proposed research directly aligns with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of\nChild Health and Human Development\u2019s scientific priorities to reduce the incidence of neurodevelopmental\ndisorders, optimize outcomes for preterm infants by understanding nutrition/feeding and the microbiome, and\nto understand human milk composition in relationship with maternal characteristics. During the K99 phase,\nmeasurement of perceived, biological, and known maternal stressors in the NICU will be conducted and\nassessed in relation to maternal lactation and feeding outcomes (milk production, mothers\u2019 own milk vs donor\nmilk vs preterm formula) (Aim 1). Infants will also undergo neurodevelopmental testing via\nelectroencephalogram before NICU discharge and at 4 months corrected age to assess the relationship\nbetween maternal stress and preterm neurodevelopmental outcomes (Aim 2). Career development activities in\nthe K99 phase, including training in stress physiology and infant neurodevelopment, developing expertise in\nlactation/feeding outcomes for preterm infants in the NICU, and learning techniques for assessing human milk\nand infant gut composition data and their interpretation will take place in the excellent research environment at\nthe University of Minnesota School of Public Health Division of Epidemiology and Community Health and will\nprovide the skills needed to successfully examine associations of maternal stress with characteristics of\nmaternal milk and preterm infant gut composition in the R00 phase. Targeted and untargeted metabolic\napproaches and microbial analyses will be used to elucidate the relationships between human milk and\npreterm gut composition with maternal stress and preterm neurodevelopmental (Aim 3). The proposed\nresearch lays the groundwork for future clinical interventions designed to mitigate the effects of maternal\npostnatal stress through psychosocial support and/or nutritional supplementation and will also provide\nfoundational data for the successful launch of an independent research career focused on promoting nutritional\npractices which yield optimal neurodevelopment for preterm infants.",

Existing treatments for chronic cough can help,\nbut up to 50% of patients have persistent cough symptoms despite receiving standard treatments. Identifying\neffective treatments for refractory chronic cough aligns with the mission of the NHLBI to advance the treatment\nof lung and related diseases, enhancing \u201cthe health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more\nfulfilling lives.\u201d A promising approach to treating refractory chronic cough is laryngeal vibrotactile stimulation,\nwhich changes sensory input to the larynx with the goal to break the vicious cycle of cough causing laryngeal\nirritation and increased sensitivity, which in turn causes more cough. Chronic cough is associated with\nabnormalities in laryngeal sensorimotor cortex activity in areas that can be modulated by the use of laryngeal\nvibrotactile stimulation. In preliminary findings, the use of laryngeal vibrotactile stimulation was associated with\nan improvement in cough-related quality of life and cough counts, and participants expressed interest in\nincreased laryngeal vibrotactile stimulation dosing. In Aim 1 of this proposal, dose refinement for vibrotactile\nstimulation will be performed, using a series of escalating dose conditions. The most favorable dosing will be\nidentified, taking into account acceptability and tolerability for participants as well as changes in cough-related\nquality of life and objective cough counts. In Aim 2, a pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted to\nmeasure the effect of 4 weeks of laryngeal vibrotactile stimulation use on key cough outcomes. Data on\nacceptance of randomization and retention will be collected. Changes in cough-related quality of life, cough\nseverity, and objective cough counts will be measured. These aims will be conducted by a multidisciplinary\nresearch team with expertise in pulmonology, laryngeal physiology and function, clinical trials, biostatistics, and\nmedical devices, in partnership with an extensive and engaged network of referring providers. Completion of\nthese aims will provide necessary and sufficient information about the feasibility and acceptability of a\nsubsequent randomized clinical trial to definitively test the effect of laryngeal vibrotactile stimulation on\nrefractory chronic cough. In addition, the proposed project will provide a preliminary estimate of the effect of\nlaryngeal vibrotactile stimulation on cough-related quality of life as well as an estimate of the resources needed\nto conduct a subsequent definitive clinical trial. This study has the potential to lead to a non-invasive, portable,\nrepeatable treatment free of systemic side effects for the millions of people who suffer from refractory chronic\ncough.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Abstract\n The HIV/AIDS associated fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is responsible for 20% of\nglobal HIV-related mortality and has been designated on the World Health Organization Critical Fungal Patho-\ngens list. Cn is the causative agent of cryptococcal meningitis (CM), a severe infection of the central nervous\nsystem that causes irreversible neurological damage and death. Mortality rates from CM are >30% depending\nupon global region. To reduce global mortality from CM, a greater understanding of host immune responses\nand better in vivo models are needed to produce clinically translatable findings. Cn is found ubiquitously in the\nenvironment and inhalation of Cn spores leads to infection of the alveoli and deep pulmonary tissue. In immu-\nnocompetent individuals, Cn infection is contained within pulmonary granulomas leading to containment of Cn\ncells. Granulomas are formed through signaling between the innate and adaptive immune responses, specifi-\ncally between macrophages and CD4+ T cells. Advanced HIV coinfection causes depletion of CD4+ T cells\nand disrupts the signaling needed to maintain granuloma structure. Granuloma breakdown leads to fungal es-\ncape and disseminated CM disease. Better understanding of granuloma formation and breakdown can lead to\nthe development of therapeutics to prevent dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. However, cur-\nrent in vivo models do not replicate human the necrotic Cn granulomas observed in humans. My preliminary\ndata identified C3HeB/FeJ mice as producing Cn granulomas that better recapitulate necrotic granulomas in\nhumans. In addition, these mice have better survival when infected with Cn compared to C57Bl/6 (B6) mice.\nHowever, the mechanism and genes that drive this phenotype are unknown. Previous studies using Mycobac-\nterium tuberculosis (Tb) showed that deficiencies in the immune regulating gene Sp140 is involved in the\nC3HeB/FeJ necrotic granuloma response against Tb. Therefore, my central hypothesis is that sp140-deficieny\nis responsible for the production of necrotic Cn granulomas and increased resistance against Cn. To test my\nhypothesis I propose the following Aims: Aim 1) Determine the role of sp140-deficiency in the immune re-\nsponse against Cn by measuring differences in survival, fungal burden, Cn blood antigen level, cytokine abun-\ndances, and immune cell populations; Aim 2) Define the histological and transcriptional profiles of sp140-defi-\ncient Cn granulomas over time using microscopy and spatial transcriptomics, and determine the mechanisms\nby which CD4+ T cell depletion leads to granuloma breakdown. These findings will expand our understanding\nof protective host immune responses against Cn, establish a method for modeling human-like Cn granulomas\nin mice, and provide insight into the mechanism of granuloma degradation during advanced HIV coinfection.",

Sequelae of pediatric T1D\ninclude neurocognitive dysfunction in attention, psychomotor speed, mental efficiency, visual-motor skills,\nmemory, and learning possibly due to damage to posterior white matter tracts and associated gray matter\nregions. Emerging evidence suggests that diabetic ketoacidosis at time of diagnosis, glucose control, diabetes\ndevice use, sleep, and caregiver distress may be important factors that influence neurocognitive development.\nHowever, there is minimal data in this area and existing studies are limited by small sample size, short\nfollow-up time, and a lack of diversity in patient populations. A contemporary, adequately powered longitudinal\nstudy in a diverse cohort of prepubescent children is needed to understand the mechanisms associated with\nneurocognitive perturbations, critical periods for prevention and intervention, and strategies to mitigate the risk\nof neurocognitive complications in later life.\n Our research team is uniquely qualified to serve as the Biostatistics Research Center (BRC) for the\nUnderstanding Neurocognition in Youth with Type 1 Diabetes (UNYT1D) nation-wide consortium combining\nextensive experience in the coordination of multi-site clinical studies and research networks, biostatistics\nexpertise in the analysis of complex observational data, and expertise in T1D, glucose variability,\nneurocognition, and neuroimaging. Our application leverages the existing infrastructure of the University of\nMinnesota\u2019s Coordinating Centers for Biometric Research (CCBR), which has internationally recognized\nexpertise in coordinating complex, large-scale, multi-site studies and networks and over 50 years of experience\nThese substantial strengths enable the BRC to accomplish the following specific aims:1) Partner with NIDDK to\nprovide scientific leadership in the design of a longitudinal cohort study to characterize the neurocognitive\nimpact of new onset T1D in pre-pubertal children; 2) Provide overall coordination of the national multisite\nconsortium in the planning and implementation of and adherence to the protocol; 3) Provide consortium-wide\nresources for data harmonization, pipelines, management and sharing; 4) Provide expertise in all aspects of\nstudy reporting, data analysis and dissemination.\n The BRC will play a crucial role in the success of the consortium. Our research team has a proven\ntrack-record of high-impact research in the clinical management of T1D, a history of developing novel\napproaches to neuroimaging data acquisition and analysis, and extensive experience coordinating the\nactivities of and providing statistical and data management support for multi-site clinical studies and research\nnetworks.

    "abstract_text": "Project summary\nBasic research opens the door to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent existing and\nemerging public health threats. NIAID has prioritized fundamental research into underpinnings of\nthe HIV-associated chronic immune activation despite the control of viral load by daily\nantiretroviral medication. Recent findings of the HIV-1 RNA cap hyper methylation reveal a new\nparadigm of viral RNA regulation that finely tunes viral gene expression for adaptive and sustained\nvirus replication in host immune cells. Revealing preliminary research on a new generation of HIV\ndrug, which compromises replication of HIV clinical isolates without positive selection for drug\nresistance, has exposed inhibition of host TGS1 hypermethylation of HIV-1 m7G-Cap on RRE-\ncontaining RNAs, thus establishing this small molecule will be a powerful molecular probe to\ninvestigate the molecular interactions that regulate HIV cap hypermethylation. The HIV intron-\ncontaining (ic)RNA, which contains RRE, has been reported to trigger innate immune signaling in\nmyeloid cells, and the communications induce T cell markers of exhaustion. Preliminary data posit\nthe hypothesis icRNA is distinguished by its TMG-Cap, which hosts use to alleviate excessive\ninnate immune signaling. However, it remains poorly understood how the Rev/RRE on the 3\u2019- of\nviral RNA participates in the cap hyper methylation on the 5\u2019- end. Now, by integrating ample\npreliminary cryoEM studies, HIV RNA-protein co-precipitations, and documentation of the\nspecialized translation pathway licensed by the hypermethylated HIV-1 m7G-Cap, we propose an\ninnovative and breakthrough model that explains previous controversial observations and unclear\nmechanism of Rev/RRE functionality at the 5\u2019-end of HIV-1 RNA and in translation control.\nSpecifically, host RNA helicase A (RHA) homo-dimerizes upon binding cognate RNA structures\nin the HIV-1 RNA through bipartite arrangement that tethers Rev/RRE in proximity to nuclear cap\nbinding complex. Interdisciplinary tools are employed to delve into the basic science of the HIV\nTMG-Cap pathway linked to Rev/RRE. Our preliminary results posit that dysregulating the TMG-\nCap pathway triggers host innate immune signaling leading to outcomes that are advantageous\nfor the host. The overarching project goal is to define the structural basis of the HIV cap\nhypermethylation regulation for viral post-transcriptional control of gene expression and define its\nlinkage with HIV\u2019s ability to modulate host innate immune signaling. At the project completion, the\nnew information is expected to arm scientists for developing next-wave treatments to neutralize\ndeleterious immune signaling in HIV-immune cell environments.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nOstechondritis dissecans (OCD) is a developmental orthopaedic disease affecting children and young adults. It\nis characterized by formation of osteochondral flaps or fragments within joints which causes pain and disability\nand predisposes to early onset osteoarthritis. Although recent studies demonstrated that discrete areas of\nepiphyseal cartilage necrosis (termed osteochondrosis), caused by focal failure of vascular supply, are the\nclinically silent precursor lesions of OCD, it is yet to be established how the extent of the inciting vascular\nfailure, along with exposure to biomechanical trauma, determine whether these lesions heal or progress to\nclinically apparent disease.\nThe overall objective of this proposal is to use porcine models to understand factors that influence the\ndevelopment, progression, and healing of OCD lesions. To achieve this objective, we will use two specific aims\nto test our central hypothesis that the extent of ischemic epiphyseal cartilage necrosis determines the\ndevelopment of OCD, and that lesion progression is influenced by biomechanical stress. Specifically, our aims\nhave been designed (1) to investigate the relationship between the severity of vascular injury to the femoral\ntrochlear epiphyseal cartilage and the formation and progression of OCD precursor lesions and (2) to\ndetermine the role that low vs. high impact biomechanical stress plays in the formation of subclinical\nosteochondrosis lesions and their progression to clinically apparent OCD.\nOur study will establish how the extent of vascular failure and exposure to biomechanical stress drive the\nclinical course of OCD and determine characteristic gene expression profiles across OCD lesion types.\nConducting these studies in a large animal model will ensure timely translation of our results to inform clinical\ndecision making in human patients, and will also help establish controlled exercise as a component of non-\noperative treatment. Importantly, these findings will also have applicability to other juvenile orthopaedic\ndisorders of vascular origin such as Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\n This K23 Career Development Award is designed to provide the training needed for the PI to achieve\nher long-term career goal of conducting independent, programmatic intervention research in developmental\npopulations. The training will emphasize gaining expertise in higher-intensity, multi-method, within-subject data\ncollection and analysis. This award builds on the PI\u2019s emerging experience in tic disorders and pediatric\nbehavioral interventions, and her ability to quickly learn and apply advanced statistical methods. The award will\nextend the PI\u2019s training through the following short-term training goals: 1) multi-method data collection and\nintegration (electronic momentary assessment [EMA], wearable devices, neurocognitive tasks), 2) leading and\ndesigning pediatric clinical trials, 3) managing and analyzing large, multilevel datasets, and 4) career\ndevelopment and contribution to the field. The PI has developed a training plan to accomplish these goals in\nconcert with her mentors, a team of leading experts in the fields of psychiatry and psychology, who will closely\nmonitor training through regular meetings. The highly structured training plan also includes a set of formal\ncoursework and workshops for each training goal to complement the hands-on experience the PI will gain from\nleading the research project.\n The objective of this proposal is to comprehensively map symptom change across time and during a\nbehavioral intervention for youth with Persistent Tic Disorders (PTDs). PTDs affect approximately 1% of the\npopulation, can cause significant disability, have high rates of comorbidity, and are associated with a four-fold\nincrease in suicide risk. Research has established that tic symptoms and their change over time are highly\nidiographic. However, first-line, evidence-based, existing interventions are \u201cone-size-fits-all,\u201d and are only\neffective for 60% of patients. The current study aims to use advanced statistical methods and a novel\ntheoretical framework to map the stability of tic patterns, along with systemic factors that relate to tic change\nover time. Study hypotheses, based on the literature and preliminary data, are that a) tic change patterns will\nbe stable before intervention for all participants, b) disruption of stable patterns during the intervention phase\nwill be associated with treatment response, and c) this disruption will depend on the specific driver of tic\nsymptoms pre-intervention. N = 30 youth ages 12-17 with chronic tics will be recruited for the study. There will\nbe three study phases: 1) pre-intervention (4 weeks), 2) intervention (8 weeks), and 3) post-intervention (4\nweeks). Before and between each phase, participants will complete 4 traditional assessments to assess\nsymptoms and treatment response. Throughout the 16 weeks of the study, we will collect EMA data focused\non factors relevant to tics (4x per day), physiological data from wearable devices (passive, continuous), and\nneurocognitive task performance and tic video observation (1x per week). Results will inform efforts to develop\nindividualized interventions for individuals with PTDs to improve treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nNatural killer (NK) cells are key mediators of anti-tumor immune responses, acting to directly kill cancer cells\n(CD56dim subtype) and recruit pro-inflammatory immune populations (CD56bright subtype). Recent discoveries,\nhowever, have revealed other NK cell subtypes with properties of tissue-resident and adaptive, memory-like\nphenotypes. Tissue-resident NK cells have been shown to have elevated production of chemokines, such as\nCCL3 and XCL1 that, in turn, recruit conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) and CD8+ T cells to tumors.\nAdaptive NK cells have been shown to persist for months longer than conventional NK cells and display\nenhanced tumor cell killing. Given the diversity of the NK cell repertoire, it is crucial to identify which NK cell\nsubtypes exist in tumors and are key to anti-tumor responses. To address this, our group has generated a pan-\ncancer atlas of NK cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from 326 patients across 17 cancer types. In\ndoing so, we identified prominent populations of CD56bright NK cells that display gene signatures suggestive of\nboth tissue-resident and adaptive NK phenotypes (bright-taNKs). We found bright-taNKs to display higher\nexpression of chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL3, XCL1, and IFNG, suggesting a functional role in\nimmune cell recruitment to tumors. Using a gene signature to estimate the relative abundance of bright-taNKs\nin bulk RNA-seq data, we found that bright-taNKs are associated with significantly longer disease-free survival\nin cancer patients. Thus, bright-taNKs may be critical for anti-tumor immunity and represent attractive\nphenotypes to mimic for the next generation of engineered NK cell therapies. As little is currently known about\nbright-taNKs, this proposal aims to advance our understanding of the functions of bright-taNKs in tumors and\nidentify mechanisms promoting their distinct phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will use orthogonal methods to determine\nwhether bright-taNK populations are associated with increased recruitment of anti-tumor immune populations,\nsuch as cDC1s and CD8+ T cells. We will develop a bioinformatics tool that can be paired with well-established\ntools to estimate fractions of different NK cell subtypes and other immune cell types in bulk RNA-seq data.\nAdditionally, we will apply highly-multiplexed spatial imaging tools to interrogate the spatial distribution of bright-\ntaNKs, and other NK cell populations, in tumors and their associations with other immune cell types. In Aim 2,\nwe will use gene delivery platforms to screen for transcription factors that promote features of tissue-resident\nand adaptive phenotypes in CD56bright NK cells. We will then transition the most promising gene targets to our\nclinical-grade induced pluripotent stem cell to NK cell (iNK) platform to holistically evaluate the effects on anti-\ntumor functions. Altogether, this proposal aims to advance our understanding of bright-taNKs, and other NK cell\nsubtypes, in tumors. Ultimately, drivers of favorable NK cell properties can be readily integrated into our group\u2019s\nbench-to-bedside pipeline for NK cell therapies to enhance their efficacy and durability.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe use of specific pathogen free (SPF) mice has been instrumental in the advancement of immunological\nresearch, reducing variability between experiments and institutions. However, it is becoming increasingly\nevident that pathogen experience alters the immune system dramatically. This limits the translation potential of\ndiscoveries in SPF mice, as humans are regularly exposed to pathogens from birth. Work from the Hamilton\nlab and others has found that increasing the microbial exposure of mice through pet shop mouse cohousing\n(COH) alters the immune compartment of mice to more accurately reflect that of an adult human. This change\nis particularly evident in the memory CD8 T cell compartment. The CD8 T cell memory pool contains cells with\na wide range of trafficking patterns, effector functions, and longevity. In SPF mice, the CD8 T cell compartment\nis dominated by na\u00efve cells and central memory T cells. However, COH mice and adult humans contain\npredominantly effector memory T cells, including long-lived effector cells (LLEC), a population described by the\nHamilton Lab. This proposal aims to understand how pathogen exposure and inflammation lead to the\nexpansion and maintenance of LLEC, and how the expansion of this cell population alters the overall function\nof the T cell compartment. Aim 1 will determine what proinflammatory cytokines support LLEC formation and\npersistence. Experiments will identify cytokines and other factors that lead to the increase in LLEC during\nCOH, via the use of RNA sequencing and CRISPR mediated genetic knockouts. We will also determine if we\ncan expand LLEC in the absence of pathogen exposure via administration of cytokines. Aim 2 will determine\nhow COH alters the function of LLEC, and address the consequences of skewing the memory compartment to\nLLEC for responses to systemic and local infections. This aim will utilize adoptive cell transfers and an\ninducible fluorescent reporter to determine if COH LLEC can protect against systemic and local infections.\nFocusing on CD8 T cell memory, and incorporating RNA sequencing analysis, will support goals 1 and 2 of my\ntraining plan, and the proposal will develop my skills as an academic scientist as a whole (training aim 3). The\nCenter for Immunology at the University of Minnesota is an ideal environment to complete this proposal as\nthere is a strong record of impactful immunological research and postdoctoral training, particularly within T cell\nbiology. Altogether, these studies will yield critical information regarding the importance of pathogen exposure\nand inflammation on the memory T cell compartment, as well as novel information on the functionality of\nsubsets of memory CD8 T cells. These data will be useful to develop vaccines and T cell therapies with\nincreased translation potential.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, afflicting approximately 5.7 million people, or\n60\u201380% of cases of dementia in the United States, and is predicted to triple to 16 million by the year 2050.\nDiagnosis is made after the age of 65 in 90-95% of patients, with the remaining 5-10% considered early-onset.\nSymptoms usually begin with difficulty learning new facts or recalling recent memories. In the middle stage of\nAD progression, language becomes more difficult, memory continues to deteriorate with long-term memory\nnow also being affected, patients may not recognize close relatives, and will need assistance with most\nactivities of daily living. During the late stage of AD, language is eventually lost, muscle atrophies to the degree\nthat patients cannot get out of bed or feed themselves, and pneumonia or infection of pressure ulcers usually\nleads to death. Thus, AD is clearly a significant health problem. The biochemical basis for AD pathophysiology\nis thought to be the aggregation of extracellular amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles\nof hyperphosphorylated tau protein. These markers correlate with the severity of clinical signs and symptoms\nof the disease, and it is thought that they may be directly neurotoxic. However, a more recent paradigm is that\nthese aggregates of misfolded proteins may lead to a state of chronic neuroinflammation, and that this\ninflammatory state is responsible for loss of neuronal function and neuron death. This inflammatory state is\nachieved through activation of the innate microglia, as well as the relatively understudied (in this context)\nactivation of adaptive T lymphocytes. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of T cells that dampen immune\nresponses and promote tissue repair after injury in various tissues including the brain. Recently, regulatory T\ncells have been suggested to play an important role in AD. However, important gaps in our understanding\nof Tregs in AD remain: What types of Tregs are found in the brain in AD mice relative to wildtype mice?\nand, What role do Tregs play in the progression of AD? I will address this knowledge gap in two specific\naims. In Aim 1, I will characterize the types of Tregs and their spatial localization in the aging WT and AD\nbrains, while in Aim 2 I will establish the effect of increasing or decreasing Treg numbers or function. My\nhypothesis is that brain-specific Tregs play a critical role in preventing or delaying AD progression, and that\nincreasing their number and function will lead to improved outcomes in AD. Successful completion of the aims\nof this grant will provide insight into the role of Tregs in AD. These studies will enhance my training in\ncomputational and hypothesis generating experiments (Aim 1), as well as hypothesis driven functional studies\n(Aim 2).",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\nCognitive changes occur as a normal process of aging and among the most important changes in cognition in\nnormal aging are declines in cognitive flexibility (CF). CF is considered a core aspect of executive functioning\nand describes an individual\u2019s ability to adapt their behavior and thinking to a changing environment.\nDisruptions in CF impact functional independence, communication with others, and socialization. Despite the\nwell-documented prevalence of CF decline in aging, and its exacerbation in neurodegeneration, the\nmechanisms that lead to structural and functional changes involved in the regulation of CF are not well\nunderstood. The majority of studies related to CF impairment have focused on changes within the\nhippocampus and cortex, however, the dorsal striatum, particularly the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), has long\nbeen strongly associated with CF. The dorsal striatum is traditionally associated with control of motor function,\nbut recent human fMRI and PET analyses demonstrated that declines in striatal function predict declining\ncognitive abilities during aging. Striatal function is governed by the innervation of two excitatory glutamatergic\ncircuits: cortico- (C-S) and thalamo-striatal (T-S). Importantly, T-S synapse density preferentially declines\nduring aging and is associated with declining CF performance. However, the regulatory mechanisms by which\nT-S synapses are preferentially lost in the aging striatum and how they contribute to CF decline is unknown.\nDepletion of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), a transcription factor canonically known for its role in\ncellular stress responses, within the striatum, accelerates T-S synapse loss and results in impairment of CF.\nHSF1 levels also decrease in aging and HSF1 has been shown to directly regulate the transcription of synaptic\ngenes within the striatum and other brain regions. Taken together, the goal of this proposal is: 1) to determine\nthe molecular underpinning that govern the differential effects of HSF1-mediated synaptic regulation within the\nDMS and 2) to understand the role of HSF1 and T-S synapses in striatal dysfunction and CF impairment. I\nwill fill these gaps in knowledge through two complementary aims. In Aim 1, I will examine the role of HSF1 in\nthe regulation of the synaptoproteome of excitatory striatal projections through proteomic analyses of T-S and\nC-S synaptic terminals and synapses from a conditional HSF1 knock-out mouse. In Aim 2, I will assess the\ncontribution of striatal HSF1 to CF by deleting HSF1 within the adult DMS using AAVs expressing Cre-\nrecombinase and the necessity of T-S connectivity to CF by optostimulation of T-S terminals in DMS.\nSuccessful completion of this proposal will provide a mechanistic understanding of how synaptic dysfunction\nwithin the DMS contributes to CF which has implications in aging and neurodegeneration, as well as establish\nthe role of HSF1 in the regulation of striatal glutamatergic synapses and CF that may result in new therapeutic\nstrategies to prevent CF deficits in the aging population.",

The voltage-gated ion channel\nCatSper is an exceptionally promising target for male contraception because it is exclusively expressed in sperm,\nis critical for sperm function, and is required for male fertility. Mice in which CatSper has been genetically deleted\nare completely infertile. Furthermore, naturally occurring CatSper mutations have been identified as the cause\nof male factor infertility in humans. Hits from a high throughput screening (HTS) campaign, blocked high\npotassium, high pH- and progesterone induced Ca2+ influx into human sperm. Moreover, these compounds\ninhibited cell hyperpolarization and hyperactivated motility (HAM) of human sperm. An ion channel selectivity\nscreening indicated good selectivity of some hits for CatSper over other ion channels. Based on these data, we\nhypothesize that we can discover and develop orally bioavailable highly selective Catsper inhibitors. The\ninhibitors will be characterized for inhibition of calcium influx, sperm motility, ion channel selectivity, and in vitro\nADMET assays. Promising compounds will be investigated for pharmacokinetic properties before examining\ntheir effectiveness on reduction of sperm motility and HAM, reversibility in mice and on mating trials in mice. We\nwill also monitor off-target effects and determine preliminary maximum tolerated doses. The goal for this project\nis the development of a preclinical candidate for male contraception.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\n Child and adolescent behavioral health problems are related to the leading causes of youth morbidity and\nmortality and are costly to society. Parent-focused interventions effectively prevent behavioral health problems\nsuch as depression and conduct disorders and can provide an economic benefit to society. Unfortunately,\nparenting programs are not widely available, not accessible, nor well-attended. Pediatric primary care is a non-\nstigmatizing setting with nearly universal reach and, therefore, an ideal access point to increase access.\nHowever, primary care clinicians (PCCs) often have insufficient training in behavioral health topics and typical\nreferral practices are often inadequate. There are also logistical barriers to attending in-person parenting\nprograms, like the need for childcare and a large time-commitment. There is a need to develop effective\nreferral practices in conjunction with increasing the accessibility of parenting programs. Our long-term goal is\nto prevent significant behavioral health problems through widespread access to effective and accessible\nparenting programs through primary care referrals. Previously, we successfully developed and pilot tested a\nbrief training for PCCs that we call Support & Guide (S&G). S&G training provides a communication strategy\nfor engaging parents in a conversation about parenting and for making referrals. We also successfully pilot\ntested a brief, online parenting intervention based on GenerationPMTO, called Empowered Generations\n(eGen); eGen is a six-session parent training program provided by therapists via video chat online to parents\nwith a child between the ages of 3-8 years. S&G training and eGen were both found to be feasible and\nacceptable, and both demonstrated promise of effectiveness. Significantly, all clinical aspects of the study have\nbeen conducted in real-world settings and systems and are highly pragmatic. In the proposed R01, we will\nbuild on the knowledge gained through the R34 to conduct fully powered randomized trials. The secondary\nobjective of this study is to test the effectiveness of brief PCC S&G training. The primary objective of this\nproject is to test the effectiveness and cost-benefit of eGen. The study design includes two parallel randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCT). In the S&G RCT, we will randomize PCCs (aim 1); in the eGen RCT we will randomize\nparents (aim 2). These two trials are linked by the fact that the parents referred by PCCs in aim 1 are the same\nparents who are invited to participate in the aim 2 eGen trial. In addition, we will examine the cost benefit of\neGen (aim 3) when implemented with community therapists and with a real-world, primary-care-referred\nsample of parents. This research is significant because it simultaneously addresses the need to develop\neffective referral practices in conjunction with increasing the accessibility of parenting programs. The\ninnovative design in this study captures the entire patient flow from initial engagement to outcomes and\noperates within real-world systems and documents the potential return on investment for payors and society.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most severe neuromuscular diseases, with a median life\nexpectancy of 22 years. DMD results from the absence of the protein dystrophin, reducing the ability of muscle\nto respond to stresses imposed by force generation and resulting in significant contractile dysfunction. In human\npatients with DMD, this manifests in progressive skeletal muscle weakness beginning around 3-5 years of age\nand cardiomyopathy and respiratory insufficiency around age 25, leading to death. In the mdx mouse model of\nDMD, the absence of dystrophin also results in rapid and robust deficits in contractility, particularly loss of force\nwith repetitive eccentric contractions (ECCs) in skeletal muscle. The mechanisms by which mdx mice undergo\nECC force loss, and those which result in broader contractile deficits of striated muscle, are poorly understood.\nPreliminary data from the Ervasti lab implicates elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent\nhyperoxidation of the thiol proteome in DMD pathophysiology. Moreover, supplementation with the\ngasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is reduced in mdx muscle, completely protects mdx extensor\ndigitorum longus (EDL) muscle from ECC force loss in vitro. The mechanisms by which H2S protects from ECC\nforce loss, and its contributions to contractility in general, are not well characterized in the context of dystrophin-\ndeficient muscular dystrophy. The studies I designed in my proposal will test the hypothesis that elevations in\nH2S will increase the persulfidation of reactive thiol residues on cysteines of contractile proteins, thereby\npreventing hyperoxidation and associated contractile dysfunction. The experiments proposed here will strive to\ncharacterize the effect of chronic, systemic H2S supplementation on DMD pathophysiology in vivo (Aim 1) and\ndefine the effects of low H2S levels on oxidative post-translational modifications in mdx contractile proteins (Aim\n2). A more complete understanding of contractile dysfunction and protection from force loss in mdx muscle is\ncritical to generating more efficacious therapeutics.\nIn addition to the research proposal, the following documents include a comprehensive and rigorous set of\nresearch and clinical training plans that will allow for the successful completion of my MD and PhD degrees and\nwill enhance my development into a productive physician-scientist, able to drive cutting-edge translational\nresearch and clinical care for my patients.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThe deltaretroviruses represent one of seven genera in the Retroviridae and are recognized as being complex\nretroviruses that encode for gag, pol and env along with several important accessory genes. These viruses have\nbeen associated with the development of lymphoid leukemias in humans (i.e., human T-cell leukemia virus,\nHTLV) and cattle (i.e., bovine leukemia virus, BLV). Deltaretroviruses are notorious for being difficult to propagate\nin cell culture, which has prohibited rigorous analyses of virus replication, including the steps involved in\nretrovirus assembly. The detailed steps involved in retrovirus assembly are poorly understood even for the more\ntractable systems, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Our preliminary studies have revealed that\nthe deltaretroviruses have distinct immature and mature particle morphologies compared to other retroviruses,\nas well as distinct Gag-Gag and capsid-capsid (CA-CA) lattice structures, which likely impacts virus particle\nformation. Furthermore, we have made observations which reveal that HTLV Gag puncta biogenesis is distinct\namong retroviruses, relying heavily on Gag recruitment to particle assembly sites by Gag already at the plasma\nmembrane. This distinctive pathway for particle assembly likely has important implications for establishment of\nHTLV particle assembly sites and the dynamics of particle assembly. In this application, we propose to advance\nour research in novel directions through innovative state-of-the-art experimental approaches, making use of\ncomparative retrovirology in order to provide deep insights into the nature of deltaretrovirus particle assembly\nand maturation. In particular, we will apply cryo-electron microscopy/tomography (cryo-EM/ET), super-resolution\nmicroscopy, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and dual-color z-scan microscopy to\ninvestigate the 1) structure-function analysis of deltaretrovirus maturation, 2) deltaretrovirus Gag recruitment and\npuncta biogenesis, and 3) analysis of critical steps in deltaretrovirus particle biogenesis. The proposed studies\nwill extend our preliminary studies and exploit advanced imaging technologies to gain new insights into the\ndeltaretrovirus particle assembly pathway, which we have demonstrated as being distinct from other retroviruses.\nThis research will provide foundationally important knowledge regarding the details of virus assembly at the\nplasma membrane for enveloped viruses.",

One\nof the key aspects of HIV-1 replication that has remained underexplored has been virus particle assembly.

Integrative, comparative retrovirology has been\nparticularly informative in gaining a deeper understanding of these steps in retroviral replication. For instance,\nimmature particle morphology and the flexibility of the immature Gag lattice differs among retroviruses, which\nhave been insightful for understanding the role of gaps in the Gag lattice and its relationship to relieving stress\nof lattice curvature. Furthermore, the recruitment pathways for retroviral Gag punctum formation, as well as the\nrole and nature of the actin cortex on assembly site selection and biogenesis also remain poorly understood\naspects of the retrovirus assembly pathway.

Viruses and their capacity to cause serious diseases\nand death have had a profound impact on the history of humanity and continually threaten global health and\neconomic stability. This was dramatically emphasized by the COVID-19 pandemic. This training program utilizes\n44 accomplished preceptors, who are conducting research on a wide variety of important viruses. The Institute\nfor Molecular Virology (IMV) serves as the focal point for virology research at University of Minnesota (UMN) and\nhas championed virology research as a critically important university investment at a time of declining institutional\nresources. Such investments in the past decade have included a 80,000-square-foot, $63 million Microbiology\nResearch Facility that opened in 2015 as well as $25 million for additional research infrastructure.\nKey highlight\u2019s of the training activities of our program in the current funding segment include the creation of a\nvirology-dedicated graduate course designator and the implementation of foundational coursework in virology\nas well as a wide-range of IMV-sponsored activities attended by both trainees and preceptors that provide\nimportant intellectual, technical, and career development opportunities (i.e., weekly Virology Journal Club,\nmonthly IMV Research in Progress seminars, quarterly IMV Innovations in Virus Research Lecture Series,\nannual UMN-Mayo Distinguished Lectures in Virology & Gene Therapy, the IMV Educational and Career\nDevelopment Series, the annual IMV Symposium, a collaborative \u2018Wisc-e-sota\u2019 T32 symposium, and annual\nsessions in Responsible Conduct in Research). Trainee participation in these training program activities have\nfostered the exchange of ideas and stimulated collaborative projects. Oversight of trainee progress is monitored\non multiple levels, including yearly evaluations by the training program Executive Committee.\nOutstanding predoctoral trainees are attracted to the UMN. From this pool, outstanding predoctoral trainees are\nrecruited to preceptor labs by the individual strength of each preceptor\u2019s research program. Trainee recruitment\nis enhanced by the breadth of career development opportunities provided through the IMV that include the\nhosting of national and international virology meetings that brings students \u2013 including students from\nunderrepresented populations \u2013 to our campus to develop long-lasting interactions with all members of our\nvirology research community.

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nGeneration of a functional adaptive immune response relies on the collaboration of the cellular (T cell) and\nhumoral (B cell) compartments. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells provide essential help to B cells to undergo\nisotype class-switch recombination and generate high-affinity antibody through somatic hypermutation.\nFollicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells have been implicated in controlling this process as they have been shown to\nbe critical in regulating germinal center B cell responses and prevent autoantibody formation. However, how\nthese Tfr cells develop is unknown. B cells undergo a unique type-III interferon dependent and isotype class-\nswitching process in the thymus, the location of T cell development, and induce clonal deletion and Treg cell\nselection. Developing Treg cells that depend on licensed thymic B cell antigens may also interact with\nactivated B cells in the periphery and take on a Tfr phenotype. Thus, Treg cells selected by thymic B cells may\nbecome Tfr cells in the periphery and help to reduce the risk autoantibody generation.\nThe objective of this work is to understand what role licensed thymic B cells play in T cell tolerance. In this\nproposal we identified T cell receptors that generate Tfr cells when expressed by developing T cells, propose\nto study the requirements of these TCRS for selection as well as explore further functional consequences\nwhen thymic B cells are absent. Our central hypothesis is that type-III interferon drives thymic B cell\nlicensing, resulting in the presentation of B cell activation induced self-peptides, thereby supporting\nthe development of Treg cells that become Tfr cells and regulate humoral immune responses.\nThrough this work we hope to generate a mechanistic understanding of the impact of thymic B cell activation\non immune tolerance. These findings will have the potential to reveal new pathways regulating adaptive\nimmune responses and have implications in our understanding of autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus\nerythematous or rheumatoid arthritis, diseases where pathogenic autoreactive antibodies mediate disease.

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe highly conserved Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway is essential for cells to communicate directional\ninformation between neighboring cells to drive collective cell movements and oriented cell behaviors during\nembryonic development. Disruptions in PCP signaling lead to severe developmental disorders including\ncongenital heart defects, neural tube closure defects, and shortened body axes. The core PCP proteins are\ntransmembrane proteins that asymmetrically polarize to opposite sides of the cell. Extracellularly, the proteins\nform an asymmetric bridge that directly couples the polarity of one cell to its adjacent neighbors. In this way, the\nPCP proteins self-organize to coordinate cell polarity at the local level. A hallmark of PCP polarity, however, is\nits tissue-wide coordination, spanning hundreds or thousands of cells across great distances. The self-organizing\nproperties of the core pathway alone cannot account for this long-range coordination as self-organization could\noccur spontaneously in any direction. Further, modeling has shown that self-organization can only propagate\nlocally, resulting in a swirling pattern of PCP polarity rather than tissue-level coordination. For this reason, the\nPCP field has come to a consensus that \u2018directional cues\u2019 are key missing factors that must link the PCP axis to\nthe tissue axis. Directional cues are thought to act in a gradient across a tissue where they bias the distribution\nof the PCP proteins along the same axis by regulating their trafficking, stability, or turnover. Despite a general\nconsensus on how directional cues could pattern PCP organization, the identities of these cues remain elusive.\nAs such, the mechanism of their action cannot be interrogated. A major challenge in identifying directional cues\nis that they are also required for tissue growth and differentiation. Thus, the tissue of interest becomes\ncompromised in the absence of the cue, making it difficult to investigate the cue\u2019s role in organizing PCP in\nisolation. Epidermal tissues provide a striking readout of planar polarity in their uniform alignment of bristles,\nscales, fur, and feathers across an animal\u2019s body. Remarkably, spontaneous mutations in small mammals and\nbirds have produced animals with region-specific misorientation of epidermal polarity. From these phenotypes,\nwe hypothesize that the skin is compartmentalized into region-specific domains that require multiple directional\ncues to coordinate polarity across the tissue. Further, the fact that the skin is morphologically normal under these\nconditions despite the polarity defects demonstrates that the skin can be leveraged as a model system to\ninterrogate directional cues. Our long-term goal is to identify and study the directional cues that pattern PCP\nacross the mouse epidermis to reveal mechanisms that coordinate long-range polarity. By using natural variants\nand taking a candidate approach, we will identify and characterize directional cues and will reveal how they alter\nthe dynamics of PCP asymmetry along a tissue axis. This approach addresses critical and long-standing\nquestions in the PCP field and will shed light on fundamental mechanisms that pattern embryonic tissues.",

Currently, the mechanisms contributing to disordered sleep in people with PD are poorly\nunderstood and there is a critical need for therapeutic inventions to improve sleep quality. This project will provide\nnew insight into the pathophysiology of sleep-wake disturbances in PD by characterizing the changes in sleep-\nrelated neuronal activity and physiological interactions that occur between subcortical and cortical structures in\nthe basal ganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit during progressively more severe parkinsonian states. We will\nexpand our previous work to include the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) given its critical role regulating sleep-\nwake states and extensive connectivity to the BGTC, exploring the changes in coupling and connectivity that\noccur within and across the BGTC-PPN network that underlie disordered sleep in PD secondary to dopaminergic\nloss in the substantia nigra (Aim 1). It will compare how deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the STN, GPi, and GPe\nmodifies subcortical-cortical interactions in the BGTC-PPN circuit to influence sleep-wake behavior and elucidate\nthe fiber pathway activations underlying these changes (Aims 2 and 3). This study will provide data with\nimmediate translational value by identifying whether DBS in one target is more effective than another in\nnormalizing sleep-related neuronal activity and improving sleep-wake behavior. Furthermore, knowledge about\nhow changes in neuronal activity across the BGTC-PPN network correlates with altered sleep from normal,\nparkinsonian, and parkinsonian+DBS conditions will provide the basis to develop more effective stimulation\nstrategies that utilize target-specific physiological biomarkers and closed-loop DBS control paradigms tailored to\nindividual patient's sleep disturbances. These data will also provide the basis to target specific pathways with\nDBS to optimize sleep-related outcomes in PD.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nOver 75% of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have significant sleep-wake disturbances that are major\ncontributors to decreased quality of life and can be more disabling and resistant to treatment than the motor\nsymptoms of PD. Currently, the mechanisms contributing to disordered sleep in people with PD are poorly\nunderstood and there is a critical need for therapeutic inventions to improve sleep quality. Deep brain stimulation\n(DBS) has been shown to improve sleep in PD however effects are highly variable across patients. A better\nunderstanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying sleep dysfunction in PD, how DBS affects sleep quality,\nand the neurophysiological changes and patterns of pathway activation with DBS that underlie these changes\nwould provide the rationale for development of circuit-based DBS approaches to the treatment of sleep disorders\nin PD. The goal of this proposal is to: (1) characterize the changes in oscillatory activity and connectivity in the\nbasal ganglia-thalamocortical network during disturbances in sleep in PD patients; (2) examine the relative\neffects of DBS in the STN or GPi on these changes; (3) identify the neural pathways that are preferentially\nactivated (or avoided) in patients with improved or impaired sleep after STN or GPi DBS. We will leverage the\nwell-established infrastructure at the University of Minnesota to externalize DBS leads and perform\nelectrophysiology recordings and stimulation studies in PD patients prior to pulse generator placement (Specific\nAims 1 and 2). We will also use high-resolution 7 Tesla (T) MRI, diffusion tractography, and subject-specific\ncomputational biophysical modeling to associate pathway activation patterns with quantitative and qualitative\nmeasures of sleep outcomes in the year following DBS surgery (Specific Aim 3). This project will increase our\nunderstanding of the role of BG-cortical activity patterns on sleep and provide new insights into the mechanisms\nby which DBS impacts sleep. It will inform the development of more effective stimulation strategies to normalize\nsleep activity that utilize physiological biomarkers and closed-loop control paradigms tailored to individual\npatient's sleep-wake cycle. These data will provide the basis to target specific pathways with DBS to optimize\nsleep-related outcomes in PD.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nTick-borne Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging public health threat, but has been understudied to date.\nSince its discovery in 1958, human cases of POWV have been reported in the United States, Canada, and\nRussia. Starting in 2006, confirmed cases of POWV have increased in both frequency and scope in New\nEngland and the Upper Midwest. Notably, POWV is now considered an emerging public health threat because\nit has been frequently associated with the aggressive, human-biting blacklegged tick vector, Ixodes scapu-\nlaris. The future spread of POWV is unpredictable, but it will be important to understand the potential for more\nwidespread emergence. The goals of this project are to evaluate whether there are regional, local, and even\nhyperlocal differences in the genetic structure of tick and POWV populations that affect patterns of POWV\nhost/vector competence, virulence, and evolution. These questions are important because our knowledge of\nhow tick-borne flaviviruses are maintained in distinct transmission foci and how new transmission foci emerge\nis limited. Accordingly, through this NIH/NIAID R01, we will seek to examine these relationships across Minne-\nsota and New York, two states with increasing burdens of tick-borne disease risk. There are 3 specific aims:\n1. Assess the distribution and genetic structure of POWV and Ixodes scapularis from distinct foci\n in the Northeast (NY) and Midwest (MN) U.S.\n2. Evaluate the extent to which tick population interacts with viral genotype to drive local adapta-\n tion and regional variability in Ixodes scapularis competence for POWV.\n 3. Determine how POWV genetic variability and regional selective pressures impact host compe-\n tence and disease heterogeneity.\nIn these studies, we will expand POWV surveillance activities in MN to intensely sample POWV genomes and\ntick populations from across the state. The NY State Department of Health has a robust POWV surveillance\nprogram in place for this project that we will leverage. We will also seek to understand the phenotypic and ge-\nnotypic underpinnings of virus\u2013host dynamics for POWV using mouse and tick experimental systems. These\nstudies are critically important because POWV likely will continue to emerge in the future. Therefore, under-\nstanding how POWV overcomes evolutionary barriers to emerge and cause disease in humans will be critical\nfor prediction, prevention, and control of this arboviral disease.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nThe thymus plays a critical role in preventing autoimmunity by deleting or inducing a Treg cell\nfate in thymocytes that react to self-antigens present in the thymus. But it is unclear how the\nthymus achieves tolerance to transiently expressed self-antigens, like those expressed in\ninduced immune states such as inflammation, wound repair, and germinal center reactions. We\nhave recently discovered that the thymus constitutively produces type I and III interferons and\nclass switched activated B cells, beginning quite early in life. Our published and preliminary data\nshow that these cytokines activate antigen presenting cells in the thymus environment and\ncause reproducible changes in the T cell repertoire selected, particularly the Treg cell repertoire.\nThus, we seek to test the hypothesis that T cells need to be highly tolerant of induced immune\nstates (inflammation, germinal centers) in order to function in those states without inducing\nautoimmune pathology.\nThe proposed research will: 1) Test if thymic IFN provides T cell tolerance to interferon\nstimulated self-antigens, 2) Determine why IFNI/III deficient mice have a major thymic selection\ndefect, and 3) Test if IFNIII-licensed B cells select Treg cells that regulate humoral immune\nresponses.\nThese aims will provide a mechanistic understanding of the source and consequences of innate\nimmune activation in the thymus.

During its long history, this training grant has served as a solid and consistent base of support for the highest quality graduate students in Immunology at the University of Minnesota. In doing so, it has played a key role in the development of the first University of Minnesota graduate program to feature Immunology, the recruitment of over 32 new immunology faculty, and the establishment of the multi-departmental Center for Immunology that now coordinates all University of Minnesota research and educational activities in this field. Most predoctoral students who seek training in Immunology enroll in the Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology (MICaB) Graduate Program. They take graduate level courses in cell and molecular biology and a rigorous semester-long foundational course designated \"Immunity and Immunopathology\" and an in-depth and intensive course called \"Current Topics in Immunology\". Predoctoral students are chosen for this training grant usually in their second or third year of training, through a competitive selection process based on research productivity and potential. All T32 preceptors vote to choose the new trainees. Once elected, students are supported for 2 years to conduct research in the laboratory of one of 28 preceptors whose interests broadly cover the field of Immunology. Supported students participate in research-in-progress meetings, journal clubs, and seminars featuring outside speakers. Trainees typically complete their research after 2-3 years, often publishing their work in high-impact journals, and then move on to postdoctoral training at top research institutions. The quality of the research produced by students supported by this training grant reflects an outstanding research environment, where faculty are highly invested in the success of trainees. This training grant is the only vehicle available at the University of Minnesota to enhance predoctoral-training in Immunology.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nMutations in the BRAF protein kinase are key drivers of melanoma, thyroid cancer, and colon cancer. Existing\ndrugs, like vemurafenib, that target the most common BRAF mutant (V600E) are initially effective in patients, but\nclinical resistance invariably develops after a few months. V600E BRAF normally signals as a monomeric kinase,\nwhich is readily inhibited by these first-generation drugs. Resistance to these drugs is mediated by BRAF\ndimerization, which triggers a conformational change of the kinase from an \u201c\uf061C-out to an \u201c\uf061C-in\u201d state and blocks\ndrug binding. New inhibitors have been developed to recognize the \uf061C-in state and thereby target BRAF dimers,\nbut these molecules exhibit a mysterious phenomenon called paradoxical activation in which they can increase\nBRAF activity under some conditions, rather than inhibit it. Paradoxical activation is linked to induction of BRAF\ndimers by inhibitors, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood, rendering it challenging to\ndesign new inhibitors that avoid it.\n Using an integrated biophysical approach, we built a model for paradoxical activation that describes the\nallosteric coupling between inhibitor binding and BRAF dimerization in quantitative thermodynamic terms. In our\napproach, a dataset of FRET measurements that quantify inhibitor-driven BRAF dimerization are globally fit to\nour dimerization model, yielding thermodynamic parameters that describe the allosteric coupling mechanisms\nunderlying drug-driven BRAF dimerization. Remarkably, the results show that inhibitor-driven dimerization is\nasymmetrical, with the first drug binding event triggering dimerization strongly, and the second binding event\ncontributing little additional dimerization affinity. This model accurately predicts the shape of BRAF kinase\nactivation curves measured as a function of inhibitor concentration, demonstrating that it provides a realistic\nphysical framework for understanding paradoxical activation.\n We plan to use this approach to expand our understanding of paradoxical activation in RAF kinases. In Aim\n1, we classify a large set of RAF inhibitors based on their allosteric coupling strengths and the conformation of\nthe \uf061C-helix they promote, unraveling the mechanistic connection between inhibitor binding, conformational\nchange, and BRAF dimerization. In Aim 2, we apply this approach to oncogenic mutations of BRAF to understand\nhow these mutations are coupled to inhibitor-driven dimerization and activation. In Aim 3, we extend our studies\nto higher-order complexes of BRAF, including the scaffolding protein 14-3-3, which can either weaken or\nenhance BRAF dimerization depending on the mode of interaction, and BRAF/CRAF heterodimers, which are\nan important signaling species in cells with catalytically-inactive oncogenic BRAF mutations. Collectively this\nwork will reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying paradoxical activation of RAF complexes and aid the\ndesign of new inhibitors that avoid triggering paradoxical activation.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nNeuroblastoma is the most common solid tumor in infants. About 25% of patients have high-risk\nneuroblastoma, a devastating disease with poor prognosis and few treatment options. The primary driver of\nhigh-risk neuroblastoma is the oncogene MYCN, a MYC-family transcription factor that has no druggable\npockets and has long eluded drug development efforts.\n Recently, the protein kinase Aurora A (AurA) was shown to bind to the N-Myc protein in neuroblastoma\ncells and interfere with its ubiquitination by the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, preventing N-Myc from being\ndegraded by the proteosome. Blocking complex formation between AurA and N-Myc results in rapid N-Myc\ndegradation and cell death in neuroblastoma cell lines. The same AurA/N-Myc complex has now been shown\nto drive neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), and AurA also forms a similar complex with the closely-\nrelated c-Myc protein in liver cancer. These recent discoveries point to a new paradigm for targeting Myc-\nfamily transcription factors in cancer using inhibitors that trigger structural changes in AurA that block\nMyc protein binding and promote Myc degradation.\n Our lab has recently shown that most existing AurA inhibitors, including the current clinical candidate\nalisertib, do not have a strong enough allosteric effect on AurA to be effective at weakening N-Myc binding. In\nagreement with this, alisertib has inconsistent effects on N-Myc levels in cell lines, and has not performed well\nin ongoing clinical trials in neuroblastoma and NEPC. The weakness in our current understanding of how AurA\nbinds to c-Myc and N-Myc and how these interactions are affected by inhibitors represents a major impediment\nto this therapeutic strategy for targeting Myc-driven cancers.\n The goal of this project is to provide the missing molecular picture of the interactions between\nAurA and Myc transcription factors and how they can be modulated by inhibitor binding. We plan to use\nnew experimental tools and approaches to define how the binding of c-Myc and N-Myc alters the conformation\n(shape) and dynamics (protein motion) of AurA, and to delineate the specific structural changes an inhibitor\nmust trigger to efficiently destabilize these complexes. We will a) define the structure of the AurA/Myc\ncomplexes at atomic resolution using x-ray crystallography, magnetic resonance spectroscopies and molecular\nmodeling, b) determine how these interactions alter AurA conformation and dynamics by tracking key structural\nelements of the kinase in solution, c) correlate the effects of a large panel of kinase inhibitors on AurA\nconformation with their ability to alter the binding affinities of N-Myc and c-Myc, and d) test the efficiency of the\nstrongest AurA allosteric modulators in a series of N-Myc- and c-Myc-dependent cancer cell lines including\nneuroblastoma, NEPC and liver cancer cells. The insights will pave the way for the repurposing of existing\nkinase inhibitors and the development of new inhibitors as a new treatment modality for Myc-driven cancers.",

These molecules have high potential as novel cancer therapeutics that\ncircumvent clinical resistance to conventional orthosteric kinase inhibitors (OKI). We have developed high-\nthroughput screening (HTS) technology based on nanosecond fluorescence lifetime (FLT) detection of F\u00f6rster\nresonance energy transfer (FRET), that tracks ligand-driven kinase allostery with angstrom precision by\nmonitoring structural changes of the activation loop, the key regulatory element in all kinases. This is the first\nHTS-amenable technology that accurately resolves allosteric effects of kinase inhibitors, relying on high-quality\nnanosecond FLT readouts unavailable from conventional fluorescence plate readers (PR). PP have developed\na proprietary HTS platform that uses FRET biosensors and a state-of-the-art FLT-PR to detect structural\nreadouts in <2 min for 384-well and <5 min for 1536-well plates. By partnering with PP, we will transform our\nkinase FRET sensor technology into a broadly applicable drug-discovery platform for identifying AKIs.\nWe propose drug-discovery programs on two different targets to demonstrate broad utility and accelerate large-\nscale adoption of our technology for drug development. In AIM 1, we identify Aurora A inhibitors that\ndownregulate the undruggable c-Myc oncoprotein by inhibiting the scaffolding interaction of Aurora A with c-\nMyc. These molecules would represent a novel treatment strategy for the large number of cancer patients with\nc-Myc-driven tumors. In AIM 2, we identify allosteric inhibitors of the c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase as a novel\ntherapeutic strategy for patients with c-MET-driven lung cancer. These patients invariably develop resistance to\ncurrent MET inhibitors through acquired mutations in the ATP site, and allosteric inhibitors that bind outside the\nATP-site would circumvent this mode of resistance, filling an unmet clinical need. This UMN-PP partnership\ntranslates decades of biophysics research by two world-leading experts \u2013 Levinson and Thomas \u2013 toward drug-\ndiscovery by resolving ligand-driven allostery in kinases. This is enabled by the FLT-PR instrumentation and\nknow-how required to implement nanosecond FLT detection in assays that resolve allosteric inhibitors in true\nHTS mode. This overcomes key drawbacks of conventional kinase inhibitor screens, which detect kinase\ninhibition or binding without regard to allosteric mechanism. The platform is broadly applicable, as almost all\nkinases undergo the large-scale allosteric structural changes our technology detects. Success of this\nproject will catalyze adoption of this technology targeting a wide range of biomedically important kinases, as\nhighlighted by Photonic Pharma\u2019s successful partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb on drug discovery for other\nhigh-priority therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe supramammillary area (SuM) is increasingly appreciated for its role in a variety of functions, including\nspatial and social novelty processing via its connections with the hippocampus. Specifically, the SuM has\nprojections to the CA2 and ventral dentate gyrus (DG), believed to be important for social processing, and to\nthe dorsal DG, believed to be important for spatial and contextual processing. The hippocampus provides\ndirect inhibitory input to the SuM, but the nature and function of this connectivity is completely unknown. The\nstudies outlined in the proposal would provide important basic science groundwork for understanding this\nconnectivity, with ultimate potential impacts for better understanding and treating a range of neurological\ndisorders, including but not limited to temporal lobe epilepsy. This includes examining the hippocampal\nneurons providing the inhibitory input to the SuM, examining which subpopulations of SuM neurons receive\ninhibitory hippocampal input, and the in vivo impact of manipulation of inhibitory hippocampal inputs to the\nSuM. Based on our preliminary data, we predict that there are at least two populations of hippocampal\ninhibitory neurons projecting to the SuM -- one expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and the other\nexpressing somatostatin \u2013 located in each region and along the entire anterior-posterior axis of the\nhippocampus. We further predict the greatest number in the CA3 region. We predict, and our preliminary data\nsupports, that both SuM cells projecting to the ventral DG and SuM cells projecting to the dorsal DG receive\ninhibitory hippocampal inputs. Importantly, we see the strongest connectivity so far from the ventral\nhippocampus to SuM neurons projecting to the dorsal DG, arguing against a simple feedback inhibitory role of\nthis connection. To examine the function of inhibitory hippocampal inputs to the SuM in vivo, we will use\nfiberphotometry to record from projection-defined SuM populations, during an assortment of behavioral tests,\nwhile providing closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of inhibitory hippocampal inputs specifically at the time of\nobject or conspecific investigations. Collectively, the data will provide important insights into the nature of\nhippocampal inhibitory inputs to the SuM, including the degree to which specific SuM populations are targeted,\nand the functional significance of this connectivity, including as relates to social and spatial processing.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nDecades ago, the cerebellum was explored as a potential target for the epilepsies. Mixed results ultimately\nreduced enthusiasm, but we have now shown that with the correct stimulation parameters, electrical\nstimulation of the cerebellar cortex can provide robust seizure control in a mouse model of temporal lobe\nepilepsy. During the previous funding period, we also demonstrated that optogenetic excitation of excitatory\nneurons in the cerebellar fastigial nucleus with projections to the central lateral thalamus (but not other\npopulations of fastigial neurons) was able to inhibit hippocampal seizures. The fastigial nucleus may make a\nbetter target for deep brain stimulation than the cerebellar cortex. Unfortunately, it is not yet known if\noptimization of stimulation parameters can allow for robust seizure control when targeting the cerebellar\nnucleus (rather than cerebellar cortex) with on-demand electrical stimulation. In healthy animals, we further\ndemonstrated that optogenetic stimulation of the cerebellum can cause a transient inhibition of CA1 pyramidal\ncells, and mixed, but structured, effects on CA1 interneurons. How cerebellar intervention in epilepsy impacts\nCA1 excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations is unknown. Importantly, not only can the cerebellum\nimpact seizures, but also seizures can impact the cerebellum, suggesting bidirectional functional modulation.\nIn this proposal, we therefore examine 1) the impact of on-demand cerebellar stimulation on CA1 principle and\ninhibitory interneuron populations in chronically epileptic animals, 2) the impact of seizures on cerebellar\nfastigial and central lateral thalamic neurons, and the impact of on-demand optogenetic intervention targeting\nthe fastigial nucleus on the central lateral nucleus, and 3) if, with Bayesian optimization, electrical stimulation of\nthe fastigial nucleus can be an effective strategy, if this outperforms targeting of a different cerebellar nucleus\n(the dentate nucleus), and if targeting the downstream central lateral nucleus can also be an effective\napproach. Collectively, this data will significantly improve our understanding of temporal lobe seizure networks\n(extending far beyond the temporal lobe), improve our understanding of how cerebellar modulation may result\nin seizure inhibition, and ultimately identify potential new intervention strategies.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMARY / ABSTRACT\nIn general, enzymes are very precise at catalyzing a specific canonical reaction that fits within a particular\nmetabolic network. Still, no enzyme is a perfect catalyst. The inherent flexibility of proteins makes it difficult\nfor enzymes to distinguish their canonical substrate from structurally related compounds. Thus, many\nenzymes act on unintended substrates (i.e., substrate promiscuity). Substrate promiscuities result in the\nformation of unintended or damaged metabolites (i.e., metabolite damage) that can be a useless drain on\nmetabolism, and may be inhibitory and/or reactive, sometimes leading to toxicity. Accordingly, metabolite\ndamage repair enzymes exist for the specific purpose of counteracting metabolite damage, often by\nconverting a damaged metabolite to a canonical one. The physiological importance of metabolite damage\nand its repair has been revealed over the past ~15 years as a handful of metabolic diseases in humans were\ndiscovered to be caused by disruption of metabolite damage repair genes, many of which are highly\nconserved across the three domains of life. The proposed project will address metabolite damage repair\nassociated to the TCA cycle \u2013 a universal core metabolic pathway that is involved in energy conversion and\nis a source of chemical building blocks that supplies much of metabolism. The TCA cycle is a hotspot for\nmetabolite damage due to high carbon flux through the pathway and chemical intermediates that are\nstructurally similar organic acids, which can engage in promiscuous side reactions catalyzed by the abundant\ncycle enzymes. I have identified and characterized several highly conserved metabolite damage control\nsystems related to vitamin, cofactor, and amino acid metabolism, and my training has empowered me with a\nunique skillset and perspective that is allowing me to make similar discoveries related to the TCA cycle. One\nenzyme that I have identified is particularly intriguing. A prevalent side-reaction of the TCA cycle enzyme\nsuccinate dehydrogenase oxidizes malate to enol-oxaloacetate (OAA), a metabolically inactive form of OAA\nthat is a potent inhibitor of the TCA cycle. Our results provide strong evidence this side reaction is one of the\nmost prevalent promiscuous reactions in nature, and that enol-OAA is a potent inhibitor of the TCA cycle.\nWe identified a universally conserved enzyme, OAT1, that removes the inhibitor, and show that bacterial\ncells lacking OAT1 have a severely attenuated TCA cycle. The proposed work will integrate biochemical,\ngenetic, and metabolomics/ fluxomics approaches to determine how OAT1 impacts the physiological and\nmetabolic states of prokaryotic and single and multicellular eukaryotic model organisms. Completing this\nproject will lead to the detailed characterization of a previously unrecognized but critical aspect of the TCA\ncycle, ultimately redefining one of the most universal core metabolic pathways in biology. This work will also\nprovide insights into mitochondrial metabolism and physiology that will impact human health and disease,\nand deliver a metabolite damage repair enzyme for use in optimizing synthetic biology platforms.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nSepsis is a complex, heterogeneous, global inflammatory response to an infection that precipitates critical\nhypotension, is beset with high mortality, and constitutes a clinical emergency. Large blood vessels\n(macrovessels) become atonic and fluid-permeable, while small vessels (microvascular beds) do not perfuse,\ncausing shock and hypoxic organ damage, a condition termed vasoplegia. Dr. Wise endeavors to become an\nindependently funded, collaborative surgeon-scientist by characterizing physiologic injury and defining cellular\nprocesses that occur during the vasoplegia precipitated by sepsis. While elimination of the infectious pathogen\nis most critical to survival, mitigating vasoplegic physiology prevents morbidity to vital end organs such as the\nlung. Examining the problem of vasoplegia from the lens of the vascular system necessarily requires career\ndevelopment in three key areas, identified to optimally address the research question: cell biology and multi-\nomics, use of intravital surveillance techniques (microscopy), and facility with large animal models to best\nrecapitulate human physiology in sepsis. This project is well-positioned to succeed due to a complementary\nmentorship and advisory team led by Dr. Greg Beilman (University of Minnesota), strong institutional support,\nand a focused career development plan inclusive of germane coursework, didactics, seminars and meetings.\nVasoplegia will be studied using a newly-piloted porcine \u201cfecal clot\u201d (with ischemia-reperfusion injury)\nmodel of surgically-induced sepsis. In the first Aim, fecal clot sepsis or \u201csham\u201d sepsis will be induced, followed\nby surgical harvest of mesenteric and saphenous arteries and veins after 24 hours. Cut rings from these\nvessels will be suspended in a muscle bath to determine relative severity of injury of smooth muscle cells,\nendothelial cells and extracellular matrix. Permeability will be assessed via immunohistochemical staining for\nglycocalyx. Regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and P38 MAP Kinase activation by\nputative endogenous inhibitor Niban will be studied, to assess the role of \u201coff-signaling\u201d in propagating septic\ninflammation. In the second Aim, lung microvasculature will be imaged using intravital orthogonal polarized\nspectral video-microscopy, to quantify the loss of perfused vessels and blood flow induced by fecal clot sepsis.\nAfter synthesis of macrovascular and microvascular injury patterns of vasoplegia from the first two Aims, a pilot\nmitigation strategy will be tested in the third Aim. Intravenous \u201cNiPp,\u201d a rationally designed cell-permeant\nphospho-mimetic of Niban developed in the laboratory of Colleen Brophy (co-mentor), will be administered to\nseptic pigs, to decrease harmful \u201cfeed-forward\u201d activation of injury-induced pro-inflammatory pathways leading\nto vasoplegia. The primary outcome will be improvement in a validated clinical porcine sepsis score. All pigs\nwill have systemic vascular tissue extensively bio-banked upon euthanasia. The robust animal model, data to\nbe collected, and the learned research techniques will collectively predicate a dynamic research program, with\npotential for translating our findings to ultimately improve survival from sepsis, a major unmet clinical need.",

    "abstract_text": "A. Project Summary / Abstract\nThe ongoing monkeypox (mpox) outbreak, with a total of more than 87,000 cases reported in over 100 non-\nendemic countries, highlights the pandemic potential of poxviruses. Due to its zoonotic nature with broad hosts\nand unidentified natural reservoirs of the causative agent, mpox virus (MPXV), future spillovers and outbreaks\nare expected even if the current outbreak is contained. Although typically manifesting in milder symptoms than\nsmallpox, MPXV infections can still cause significant morbidity and mortality (up to 10% for clade I) that need to\nbe therapeutically mitigated. The clinical efficacy of FDA-approved smallpox antiviral drugs is unclear or\nunpromising for treating MPXV, necessitating dedicated and expanded efforts in developing MPXV antivirals.\nThe goal of this grant application is to develop novel antivirals for treating MPXV. Prior research from our team\nhas developed and validated an efficient and robust reporter assay using the vaccinia virus (VACV), and\nidentified and characterized three high quality and chemically distinct antiviral hits with strong potencies (EC50 =\n0.14\u20122.1 \uf06dM; plaque reduction at 10 \uf06dM 1,400\u2012160,000-fold), no cytotoxicity (CC50 > 250 \uf06dM) and largely\nfavorable ADME properties. The immediate focus of this grant is to further develop these three hit series into\npre-clinical candidates using a highly integrated, multi-disciplinary approach combining medicinal chemistry,\nvirology, ADME / pharmacokinetic (PK), toxicity, animal efficacy and proteomics. Three Specific Aims are\nproposed: 1) optimization and expansion of the identified hits. Iterative structure-activity relationship (SAR) and\nstructure-property relationship (SPR) studies will be carried out via extensive analog synthesis, antiviral assay\nand ADME profiling to obtain optimized leads. Hit expansion will also be conducted by screening the high quality\nsynthetic compounds in PI\u2019s lab as well as preselected commercial compounds; Aim 2) in vivo PK, toxicity and\nefficacy studies, where the acute and sub-acute toxicity and PK studies in mice will guide compound selection\nfor efficacy studies in mice; Aim 3) determine the antiviral mechanism of action (MOA). The molecular targets\nand antiviral MOA of optimized leads will be determined using a few different methods: a) identify the viral\nreplication stage(s) targeted by the leads; b) select resistant mutants by passaging virus in cultured cells in the\npresence of individual lead compound, and sequence viral genomes to identify affected genes; The compound\nwill then be tested in recombinant viruses harboring the selected mutations; c) design and synthesize chemical\nprobes to label, pull down, and identify the target protein(s); d) test metal chelating analogs in resolvase\nbiochemical assays. Overall, 2-3 antiviral leads with strong potency, favorable PK profiles, minimal toxicities,\nand established MOA will be developed, setting the stage for further pre-clinical development of MPXV drugs\nthat will also contribute substantially to countering other orthopoxviruses.",

    "abstract_text": "The Carlson Group applies the diverse tools of chemical biology to understand how bacteria harness their\nlimited genome to inhabit nearly every ecological niche on our planet. These \u201csimple\u201d single-celled organisms\nare remarkable in their ability to respond to and survive in the presence of diverse environmental stressors. This\nis largely accomplished through related but specialized proteins that are activated under disparate conditions.\nWith NIH support, the PI has been investigating two protein families that are crucial to a bacteria\u2019s ability to\nrespond to its environment and maintain cell wall integrity, histidine kinases (HKs) and penicillin-binding proteins\n(PBPs). The PBPs are required for cell wall construction and are the targets of b-lactams, the most used class\nof antibiotics in the world. The HKs sense changes in the periplasmic space and transmit this information inside\nof the cell, allowing bacteria to respond to fluctuating environments. The HKs are also important in infection and\nantibiotic resistance. Clearly, a deeper understanding of when, where, and how the PBPs and HKs are\nfunctionally differentiated and used to enable cell survival will be crucial in combating the rapidly approaching\n\u201cpost-antibiotic era.\u201d Chemical probes are an essential tool for the characterization of these differentiating factors.\n We have pioneered the development of activity-based probes (ABPs) for the PBP and HK families that\nspecifically label catalytically active enzymes, yielding a read-out of their functional state. These molecules are\nrequired to investigate how functionally related proteins differ from one another in their catalytic activation,\nsubstrate or ligand recognition, localization, and biomolecular interactions. The overall vision for this MIRA\nproject is to build on the PI\u2019s foundation of results and leadership in this area and apply a chemical approach to\nexpand the understanding of these two enzyme families. We will achieve this vision by expanding our library of\nPBP-selective ABPs and applying these chemical probes to investigation of the roles of these proteins in cell\ngrowth and division, as well as adaptation to environmental perturbations. We will also optimize the chemical\nprobes and internalization agents needed to deliver ABPs into the bacterial cytoplasm, enabling global mapping\nof HK activation upon exposure to stimuli. Finally, we will validate the HKs as viable targets for the development\nof anti-virulence agents and adjuvants and optimize the potency of our lead compounds.\n Our combined expertise in chemical synthesis, ABPs, mass spectrometry-based -omics, biochemistry, and\nmicrobiology make us uniquely qualified to untangle the web of apparent functional redundancy within these\nenzyme families. We also have long-standing collaborators with expertise in the HKs and PBPs, as well as\nmethods critical to this project. The overall impact of this work will be a drastically increased and rigorously tested\nunderstanding of cell wall biosynthesis and signal transduction in bacteria and a suite of freely accessible\nresearch tools. Ultimately, the amassed knowledge and tools will enable us to understand and predict how a\nsignal is propagated into bacterial action and to hijack the involved proteins for disease treatment.",

Current evidence-based\nprogramming addressing adolescent conduct problems is resource intensive and has limited effectiveness.\nThe proposed R34 study will investigate the feasibility of using a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) as a\nnew approach to preventing escalations in conduct problems among at-risk youth in a school setting. MBIs\nhave been demonstrated to support the development of effective self-control, a key risk factor underlying\nadolescent conduct problems. However, MBIs have not previously been evaluated for their effectiveness in\npreventing the development of serious conduct problems.

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe bacterial genome is organized into a compact form, known as the nucleoid, consisting primarily of the\nsupercoiled circular DNA chromosome and DNA-binding proteins. Generation and maintenance of the nucleoid\nstructure, which arises without a nuclear membrane or the chromatin present in eukaryotes, is critical to bacterial\nhealth; understanding the factors that give rise to this structure are thus important for promoting synergistic\nbacteria and disrupting antagonistic pathogens. Likewise, the dynamics governing DNA loci diffusion and\nintranucleoid transport govern the time scales for DNA-protein binding. A key open question surrounding the\nstructure and dynamics of the nucleoid is elucidating those factors that can be attributed to its polymeric nature\nand those that are of biological origin. Indeed, many of the most intriguing ideas emerging from the microbiology\ncommunity in the past decade, such as density waves, the glass-like behavior of the nucleoid in the absence of\nmetabolic activity, and the connection between solvent quality and macrodomain formation, rely on connecting\nnucleoid biology to polymer physics. Unfortunately, making these connections in a definitive, quantitative manner\nhas been frustrated by (i) the lack of a suitable physical model of the nucleoid and (ii) experimental data that,\nwhen combined with such a model, are sufficient to establish the governing biophysical principles. To resolve\nthis gap in our understanding, this proposal couples (i) a multiscale, polymer physics-based model of the\nnucleoid that reflects both its equilibrium and non-equilibrium aspects to (ii) state-of-the-art biophysical\nexperiments probing the nucleoid structure and dynamics. Any model of the nucleoid must respect the\nbiological fact that the nucleoid is not a fully equilibrated system; the combination of topological domains,\nmacrodomains and chromosome interacting domains are evidence that the nucleoid is not in a global equilibrium\nthat samples the full configurational space, even if these domains can locally equilibrate over the time scale of\ncell division. We will parameterize a computationally tractable, coarse-grained (CG) model of the entire out-of-\nequilibrium nucleoid based on simulations of the rapidly equilibrated, fine-scale phenomena. By construction,\nthe CG model will incorporate large-scale, non-equilibrium constraints imposed by biology. We will then study\nnucleoid structure and dynamics over parameter ranges far beyond those available in existing data sets, using\nboth GPU-accelerated simulations of the CG model, live cell imaging, and a microfluidic experimental system.\nThe experiments will improve the CG model through feedback between them, while the CG model will reveal the\nmost useful systems for experimentation and aid in interpreting their results. Our approach will definitively\nestablish the physical laws governing nucleoid structure and dynamics. Applying those laws at biologically\nrelevant parameter ranges then provides a foundation for identifying when polymer physics can (or, even more\nimportantly, cannot) be used to understand nucleoid biology.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary / Abstract\nVocal prosody inflections are essential to function in everyday communication. For example, pitch (F0) \u2013 conveys\ninformation about expressing agreement or disagreement, to correct, to signal novel information, or to indicate\nbetween-the-lines meaning. Cochlear implants are notoriously poor at delivering accurate information about a\ntalker\u2019s voice pitch (Carlyon et al. 2002; Oxenham 2008). Difficulty in perceiving prosodic information is\nhighlighted by CI patient reports of communication breakdown and listening complaints where the tone or hidden\nmeaning of a message is misunderstood (Rapport et al. 2020). Predictably, standard speech perception\nmeasures based on intelligibility alone do not explain variability in communication ability or quality of life for\nlisteners with cochlear implants (Capretta & Moberly 2016; Hinderink et al. 2000; Moberly et al 2018).\nConversely, test batteries that specifically include skills related to vocal prosody are better at predicting quality\nof life and communication-related measures among listeners with cochlear implants, underscoring the need for\nfurther understanding of how to assess vocal prosody perception (Luo et al. 2018; Panzeri et al. 2021). To\nprovide a person with the best ability to function in a social world where perception of a talker\u2019s tone and intention\nplay a vital role, we must better understand how perception of prosody is affected by the use of a cochlear\nimplant. The first aim of the proposed work will compare perception of prosodic focus by listeners with normal\nhearing and cochlear implants. Importantly, listeners will report prosody perception for whole-sentence stimuli\nand provide responses using a multiple sliding-scale interface that will allow for differentiation of stronger and\nweaker perceptions of prosody, as well as characterization of errors in prosody perception relative to the talker\u2019s\nintended target. The second aim will explore the perceptual weighting of pitch, intensity, and duration cues in\nprosody perception for both groups, as well as basic psychophysical measures to determine perceptual access\nto prosodic prominence. The third aim will examine the impact of noise on prosodic cue weighting by these two\nlistener groups. Results from these examinations will show how differences in prosodic cue weighting result in\nweaker prosody perception and frequent mistakes for CI listeners, as well as a greater impact of noise on prosody\nperception. The long-term goals of this project are to improve our understanding of prosody perception for CI\nusers. These goals directly address the NIDCD\u2019s priority of increasing our knowledge on communication by\nindividuals with hearing loss in real world environments. The training program involves extensive instruction in\nbehavioral measures, acoustic analysis and manipulation, and advanced statistical analysis relevant to the\nproposed research. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in hearing at an\ninstitution with a strong track record of hearing loss research, a history of training grants, and interdisciplinary\ncollaboration in clinical sensory science.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nReward neurocircuitry relies in part on endogenous neuropeptide signaling to integrate complex, multivalent\ninformation and influence behavior. Opioid addiction can result in neuropeptide imbalances in the nucleus\naccumbens (NAc), a brain region critical for processing reward. Signaling by neuropeptides derived from VGF\n(non-acronymic) may be dysregulated by exogenous opioid exposure with repeated withdrawal. The\nneuropeptide precursor VGF and its derived peptide TLQP-62 serve important functions in experience-\ndependent plasticity in the nervous system, and VGF transcripts are upregulated in the nucleus accumbens\n(NAc) after drug exposure and withdrawal. My preliminary data demonstrate that knocking out VGF in the NAc\neliminates the behavioral changes typically evoked by opioid exposure and withdrawal in mice. Because these\nbehavioral adaptations are proxies for neuroplasticity in reward circuitry, we hypothesize that VGF is necessary\nfor synaptic plasticity in the NAc. The objective of this work is to interrogate the function of VGF and its derived\npeptide TLQP-62 in facilitating synaptic plasticity in the NAc, and to understand its contribution to withdrawal-\nevoked behaviors. First, I will measure the effect of exogenous TLQP-62 on synaptic transmission in the NAc\nusing whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute mouse brain slices. Past work in other regions of the\ncentral nervous system have shown that TLQP-62 potentiates excitatory transmission. We therefore hypothesize\nthat TLQP-62 will augment excitatory glutamatergic transmission into the NAc. I will then use RNA in situ\nhybridization to map endogenous VGF transcripts in the NAc and identify in which neuronal subpopulations it is\nexpressed. Finally, I will evaluate the effect of endogenous VGF on withdrawal-evoked behavior adaptations. I\nwill combine transgenic mice and viral vectors to conditionally knock out VGF expression from the NAc and use\na model of spontaneous oxycodone withdrawal before performing a battery of behavioral assays to determine\nthe locomotor, social, and sensory impact of VGF in the NAc. With these methods, spanning physiology,\nneuroanatomical mapping, and behavior, we will build an understanding of the function of VGF and TLQP-62 in\nthe NAc and the role they play in opioid exposure and withdrawal. Beyond identifying a novel target for treating\nopioid use and withdrawal, the interdisciplinary techniques used in this proposal will examine the basic science\nmechanisms of clinically urgent questions, laying the groundwork for a career planted at the intersection of\nclinical need and basic research.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nSenescent cells (SnCs) accumulate with age and in various chronic disease states and clearly contribute to\ndriving morbidity and mortality in model organisms. Drugs that selectively eliminate SnCs (\u201csenolytics\u201d) were first\ndeveloped by our team and have been demonstrated to reduce frailty, extend median lifespan, and attenuate\nmorbidity in murine models of numerous age-related diseases. However, SnCs also play a role in wound healing\nand tissue remodeling. To advance senolytics to their greatest potential, then, it is imperative to understand more\nabout SnCs in humans with healthy aging. As part of SenNet, the proposed Minnesota Tissue Mapping Center\n(MN TMC) has selected four tissues for identification, characterization, and spatio-temporal analysis of\nsenescence: adipose, skeletal muscle, liver, and ovarian tissues. These tissues were selected because of the\nscientific expertise at UMN and Mayo Clinic in the biology of these organs, evidence of increased senescence\nwith age, and availability of biobanked specimens as well as surgical access to fresh tissues from healthy\nindividuals. The overall goal of the Biospecimen Core (BSP), co-directed by Dr. Sayeed Ikramuddin, Chair of\nthe UMN Department of Surgery, and Dr. Oyedele Adeyi, Professor of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, is\nto provide the tissues and blood for PBMC isolation to the Biological Analysis Core (BAC) for bulk, single cell,\nand spatial analysis of human SnCs for subsequent multi-plex analysis of the results by the Data Analysis Core\n(DAC). The BSP will leverage their strong track\nrecord of obtaining high-quality, well-annotated human samples\nfrom non-chronically diseased individuals who are metabolically characterized and with appropriate diversity in\ngender, race, socio-economic status, ethnicity, and other relevant diversity parameters. The BSP will also\nprovide access to\nUMN\u2019s specimen procurement network (BioNet) that has ~70,000 archival tissues (frozen,\nFFPE) and biofluids (frozen) collected for research, including several adipose depots, several muscles, liver from\norgan donors, and healthy ovarian tissues removed because of benign lesions. In addition, the BSP has access\nto tissues within the Rochester Epidemiology Project, which encompasses the medical records of all citizens\nliving in Olmsted County, MN since 1966, along with archived biological specimens. The Aims of the BSP are\nto: 1) Prepare and maintain all regulatory materials supporting human tissue collection; 2) Recruit and consent\npatients of different ages for this project; 3) Characterize the metabolic health of enrolled participants; 4)\nCoordinate with BioNet for intraoperative specimen collection, annotation, and storage of tissues; 5) Procure and\nannotate high quality target tissues along with relevant biofluids; 6) Longitudinally follow patients for which weight\nloss and bariatric surgery are metabolic perturbations; 7) Disseminate the samples to MN TMC BAC; and 8)\nPartner with SenNet to share tissues and to develop shared patient consent and tissue collection protocols with\nappropriate Ethical, Legal and Social Implications and quality control and assurance considerations.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\n Direct intravenous delivery of gasses has been always considered an absolute contraindication due to\nthe fear of air embolism. However, if it were made possible, direct intravenous high content oxygen solutions\ncould ameliorate injury, improve tissue hypoxia and buy time for definitive interventions and/or prevent invasive\ninterventions such intubations. The basic resting minute oxygen requirements of a human are 3ml/kg/min or 200-\n300 ml of O2/min. During CPR, blood flow is significantly decreased and oxygenation at the lungs is frequently\nseverely impaired. Both those conditions lead to vital organ and whole-body hypoxia. An effort to increase the\noverall oxygen content of circulating blood could have significant effect on end-organ oxygenation even with\nlower blood flow and could significant delay irreversible injury that leads to significant morbidity and eventually\nmortality in this patient population.\n We have developed a method with which a highly pressured mixture of saline and oxygen can\nbe delivered directly into the vein at 1 Atm in order to dramatically increase the circulating oxygen blood\ncontent. We utilize high pressures (50-100 Atm) at room temperature (25-28\uf0b0C) to dissolve large volumes of\noxygen in the infusate to make a clinically relevant therapy and sustain body oxygen requirements for up to 10-\n20 min/L of saline infused. The concept is based on the simple idea that when the highly pressurized solution\n(eg. at 50 atm and 25\uf0b0C the dissolved volume of O2 /saline is ~2.5/1) is released under constant pressure\nthrough a nozzle that controls bubble nucleation rate and bubble size distribution evolution, a \u201cmist\u201d consisting\nof nucleated nanobubbles and saline water molecules can be delivered, which can be directly mixed with the\nreturning venous blood. The presence of venous, unsaturated hemoglobin acts as an absorption sink for the\ndelivered O2nanobubble solution (O2NBS). An optimal rate of mixing can be safe and minimize bubble formations\nthrough the process of immediate O2 uptake. Residual nanobubbles do not coalesce and therefore could\ncirculate uninterrupted through the circulatory system to act as an additional oxygen reservoir.\n In Aim 1 we will study the physics and engineering methods to optimize the solution and nanobubble\nsize characteristics under different upstream Pr/nozzle conditions. We aim to minimize nanobubble average size\nto safely deliver it in saline at 1atm and 37\uf0b0C. Aims 2 and 3 will assess the effect of the intravenous oxygen\nsolution on blood and tissue oxygenation in animal models of simulated cardiac arrest and during prolonged\nCPR. Finally, a large 72 -hour survival study will be performed. The implications to public health are self-evident\nand far-reaching for diseases like cardiac arrest, hypoxic respiratory failure, emergencies requiring intubation\nand anesthesia.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\n Cardiogenic shock is a devastating problem that has had a relatively stagnant in-hospital mortality around\n30-40% in the last decade. Consequently, an array of mechanical support strategies has emerged to mitigate\nthe multi-organ hypoperfusion. Among them, percutaneous veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane\noxygenation (VA-ECMO) is increasingly being used to treat cardiogenic shock due to its capacity to be\ninstituted rapidly in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and provide large volume complete hemodynamic\nand respiratory support. However, this strategy has notable disadvantages, namely high cost associated with\nits programmatic development and the potential for introducing iatrogenic complications in a very sick\npopulation.\n Prior invasive hemodynamic data from animal models have suggested that there is deterioration of LV\nperformance due to increased stroke work within minutes of the commencement of VA-ECMO hemodynamic\nsupport. There is also observational clinical data showing that LV distension may worsen with VA-ECMO\nsupport. Conversely, human data from our group\u2019s prior experience have suggested that VA-ECMO support in\npatients with minimal pulsatility after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest can dramatically improve cardiac recovery\nand rates of neurologically favorable survival.\n These conflicting data have led to the emergence of diverse management strategies including VA-ECMO in\npatients with cardiogenic shock either due to AMI or cardiac arrest. In the context of the rapidly increasing\nusage of VA-ECMO usage there is a critical need to identify the manner in which VA-ECMO affects cardiac\nhemodynamics in the setting of cardiogenic shock.\n To that goal we will pursue the following specific aims:\n1. Define the LV pressure volume area (PVA) and stroke work at different levels of VA-ECMO support in\npatients cannulated for CS. 2. Define the temporal changes of LV stroke work with prolonged VA-ECMO\nsupport over the course of the hospitalization.

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary:\nDespite reductions in antimicrobial use and implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs, antimicrobial\nresistant (AMR) pathogens continue to emerge and persist, causing millions of deaths every year. The long-term\ngoal of this proposal is to decrease clinical AMR incidence by advancing knowledge of how AMR develops,\npersists and transmits to pathogens within the microbiome. The overall objective of this project is to develop a\nnovel high-throughput method for generating enriched long-read sequencing data that accurately reflects the in\nsitu dynamics of AMR genes across entire microbial communities. This is a major gap in methodology that\nhampers knowledge discovery and leads to suboptimal patient outcomes. The rationale is that this method will\nenable fundamental advances in both applied and basic research through: improved prediction about when and\nhow bacteria exchange AMR genes; and rapid, lower-cost, higher-throughput generation of metagenomic\nresistome data. The project objective is achieved through three specific aims: 1) Increase the sensitivity and\nspecificity of probe-based pre-sequencing enrichment; 2) Generate contextualized metagenomic sequence data\nwith real-time enrichment of antimicrobial resistance genes; and 3) Evaluate the performance of triple-enrichment\nusing samples with diverse antimicrobial resistance gene composition. Under aim 1, probes for all potential off-\ntarget (i.e., AMR) DNA will be designed using a novel compressed colored de Bruijn graph. Probes will be\nmanufactured and used to deplete off-target DNA from metagenomic samples prior to enrichment of AMR genes.\nFor aim 2, adaptive Nanopore sequencing will perform real-time rejection of off-target DNA using a compressed\npangenomic index of all off-target regions, followed by on-the-fly classification of antimicrobial resistance genes.\nFor aim 3, the potential bias of probe- and sequence-based enrichment will be quantified on a gene-by-gene\nbasis to fully evaluate the performance of the enrichment workflow for various sample types and use cases. The\nproposed research is innovative for two major reasons: first, it enables the applied use of microbial ecology for\nclinical and public health applications, which is a major gap in the field of metagenomics; second, it allows for\ndeep sequencing and robust genomic co-localization of rare and low-abundance metagenomic targets, which is\ncurrently very difficult to obtain. The proposed methodology will open new horizons for basic research into how\nand why bacterial communities evolve; and under what conditions diverse bacteria share critical functions such\nas AMR. The proposed research is significant because it will have broad applicability to many critical activities\nfor combating AMR, including patient-centric decisions about antibiotic use and public health activities such as\nAMR surveillance. The proposed advancements will help predict AMR emergence events in patients and\npopulations; identify hot-spots of AMR development and dissemination in hospitals and the community; and help\ntrack critically important AMR genes that may be rare or low-abundance within a given environment or set of\nsamples.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nSodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a novel class of medications that reduce CVD events,\nparticularly heart failure (HF) outcomes in patients with HF and reduced or normal left ventricular (LV) function.\nThe mechanism for the effect of SGLT2i is not well understood, but they may beneficially alter LV structure and\nfunction through changes in plasma proteins. Atrial myopathy is a novel biomarker for increased cardiovascular\ndisease (CVD) risk. Atrial myopathy is characterized by abnormalities in the structure, function, and electrical\nconduction of the left atrium (LA). LA function can be quantified using strain analysis with 2-dimensional\nechocardiography (2DE) allowing detection of LA dysfunction before overt structural changes and LA\nenlargement occur. LA dysfunction is associated with increased risk for atrial fibrillation, stroke, dementia, and\nheart failure. Despite this risk, there are no proven therapies to treat or prevent LA dysfunction. Untargeted\nproteomic analyses done in adults with LA dysfunction are suggestive of an association with plasma proteins\ninvolved in cardiomyocyte function and inflammatory pathways. The goal of this K23 Career Development\nAward is to conduct a 9-month double-blind placebo-controlled RCT of empagliflozin (an SGLT2i) in 80\nindividuals at risk for HF but no diagnosis of HF or diabetes. Individuals will be identified by screening patients\nwho visit the Cardiology clinic at the University of Minnesota. The primary endpoints for the proposed RCT\ninclude changes in LA and LV function assessed by 2DE at baseline and 9 months; and change in 8 a priori\nidentified plasma proteins. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that change in LA function from baseline to 9 months\nwill be more favorable in the empagliflozin group than placebo. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that change in LV\ndiastolic from baseline to 9 months will be more favorable in the empagliflozin group than placebo. Aim 3 will\ntest the hypothesis that compared with placebo, empagliflozin will be associated with greater change in the\nselected proteins after 9 months. The proposed training and mentoring plan has the following goals: 1) acquire\nexpertise in clinical trial design, implementation, and analysis; 2) develop expert knowledge in left atrial\nmyopathy; 3) acquire necessary skills to design, execute, and interpret studies involving proteomic analysis; 4)\ndevelop enhanced collaborative skills, written and oral communication skills, and management skills necessary\nto lead a multidisciplinary team. The training plan includes attendance at educational seminars and scientific\nmeetings, structured mentoring, formal coursework, and hands on experience on this mentored K23 project\nand other collaborative research with mentors. In summary, the requested K23 support will provide the training\nand mentoring necessary for the candidate to establish himself as a successful independent physician scientist\nin the field of preventive cardiology. The proposed research will also provide novel preliminary evidence\nregarding the effect of empagliflozin on LA and LV function in an understudied population, informing a future\nR01-funded RCT evaluating SGLT2i treatment effect on CVD outcomes in patients without diabetes or HF.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nBackground. Agents that inhibit Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling are the standard-of-care treatment for\nprostate cancer (PC) patients. Unfortunately, essentially all patients develop resistance to AR targeting\ntherapies (ART). We previously found robust B7-H3 (CD276) expression in metastatic PC patients resistant to\nART. In our recent phase II clinical trial, we found that B7-H3 targeting agents improved clinical outcomes for\n66% of PC patients for reasons unknown. We separately examined mechanistic regulators of B7-H3\nexpression with computational and laboratory approaches. We preliminary found that B7-H3 expression was\nregulated by AR and its co-regulators (FOXA1, HOXB13) at four transcription regulatory sites. Altogether, we\nhypothesize that AR activity regulates B7-H3 expression and thus response to B7-H3 targeted therapies.\nSpecific Aims and Study Design. We propose to determine mechanisms of B7-H3 expression by examining\nthe necessity of all B7-H3 transcription factors and regulator sites in PC (AIM 1). This includes the AR co-\nregulators HOXB13 and FOXA1, as well as the four B7-H3 enhancer sites that were hyperactivated in\nmetastatic PC compared to primary disease. We will also determine how androgens or ARTs, which are used\nclinically, impact the susceptibility of ART resistant tumor cells towards B7-H3 targeted therapies (AIM 2). We\nwill utilize single cell RNA-sequencing platforms to identify the genes and signaling programs associated with\nresponse to B7-H3 therapies in single cells. Lastly, we aim to identify the clinical and molecular characteristics\nof the PC patients with predicted response to B7-H3 targeted therapies (AIM 3). We will use computer-\nmodeling tools to characterize the somatic changes and clinical features of patients that previously responded\nto a B7-H3 targeted therapy. We will then apply this response signature to ~7000 additional tumors to identify\nsignificant clinical and molecular features that are predictive of response.\nAnticipated Outcomes. We anticipate that the candidate transcription factors and regulatory sites of B7-H3\nwill control B7-H3 expression in PC tumors. Further, such changes in cell surface B7-H3 expression will greatly\nimpact the tumor-forming capacity and ART resistance. We also anticipate that clinical forms of androgens or\nART will alter B7-H3 expression and thus impact response to the B7-H3 targeted therapies. Lastly, we expect\nto identify many of the additional clinical and molecular features associated with B7-H3 expressing tumors.\nFuture Directions and Impact. We anticipate this study will uncover mechanistic insights of B7-H3 expression\nand a further understanding of PC patient response to B7-H3 targeted therapies. We shall also identify the\nmechanisms by which B7-H3 regulates ART resistance, tumor formation, and cell signaling. Lastly, our findings\nwill impact patient stratification methods in the upcoming B7-H3 clinical trials, which will be essential to the\ndevelopment and deployment of future B7-H3 therapeutics in PC patients.",

    "abstract_text": "MRI is the most advanced and the most used tool in our armamentarium to study the human brain. However,\nhighest possible resolution achievable with existing methods falls short of goals set for the next generation\nHuman Connectome Project (HCP) or the BRAIN Initiative that calls for the capability to study the organizing\nprinciples of the human cortex at the mesoscopic or sub-mesoscopic scale. Our long-term goal is to advance\nultrahigh field (UHF) MRI through innovative technical developments applied at the highest possible magnetic\nfield available for human studies. The overall objective of this study is to develop a new suite of MRI tools that,\nwhen synergistically combined with the unique UHF of 10.5 Tesla (10.5T) and optimized instrumentation (RF\ncoils and gradients), will enable us to acquire high-quality, whole- and partial-brain functional MRI (fMRI) at\nunparalleled spatiotemporal resolutions, ushering in the next generation HCP and approaching the ambitious\nresolution target (i.e., 0.01-\u00b5L voxel volumes) set in the strategic plan developed by the second BRAIN Initiative\nWorking Group. The overall objective will be accomplished by pursuing four specific aims: Under aim 1, we will\ndevelop and optimize new high-channel-count transmit and receive RF arrays to leverage SNR gains available\nat 10.5T while enabling RF parallel transmission (pTx) for flip angle homogenization and SAR reduction. For aim\n2, we will devise two new pTx pulse design frameworks that incorporate RF-power-related constraints for water-\nselective excitation tailored for whole-brain scan without the need for additional fat saturation, and a fat-selective\nsaturation and a water-selective excitation, suitable for partial-brain scan of a single imaging slab. Under aim 3,\nwe will develop i) a comprehensive pTx-enabled 3D GRE EPI sequence for rapid high-quality high-resolution\nwhole-brain and partial-brain scans, all with joint motion and field correction, ii) a computational toolkit enabling\nreal-time motion detection, background field measurement, and GIRF-based field dynamics determination using\nNMR field probes, and iii) a tailored image reconstruction for producing motion- and field-corrected images based\non field dynamics and motion detection. The results will be compared to those obtained with our long-standing\nand extensively used 2D simultaneous multi-slice EPI sequence. For aim 4, we will develop and demonstrate\nbrain fMRI at spatiotemporal resolutions that are much higher than what is possible with existing methods. The\nresearch proposed in this application is significant because it is expected to have a broad positive impact on\nvarious fields including ultrahigh-field MRI, RF hardware, high-resolution fMRI, parallel transmission, data\nacquisition, image reconstruction, and neuroscience. The proposed research is innovative because it represents\na new and substantive departure from the existing approaches by shifting focus to developing a synergy of\nvarious technical innovations that can help realize the full potential of 10.5T, enabling ultrahigh-resolution fMRI\nand increasing our ability to study brain function at the mesoscopic scale.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSubstance use disorders (SUDs) impair the health and well-being of over 40 million Americans and claim\n106,000 lives each year due to a lack of effective treatments. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), which consists of\nmedium spiny neurons (MSNs) marked by expression of Dopamine-1 or -2 receptors (D1 or D2, respectively),\nis a reward center of the brain that exhibits changes in synaptic plasticity that drive addiction. D1-MSNs drive\nrewarding behaviors, such as addiction, while D2-MSNs drive aversive behaviors. Thus, identifying precise\nmolecular targets that modulate D1-MSN synaptic signaling would hold promising therapeutic potential for SUDs.\nAngiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is selectively expressed in D1-MSNs within the NAc. In the brain, ACE\nhydrolyzes numerous neuropeptides, including the enkephalin Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (MERF), which has a\nhigh affinity for opioid receptors. ACE inhibition (ACEi) increases levels of MERF in the NAc, which acts in a \uf06d-\nopioid receptor (MOR) dependent manner at excitatory presynaptic inputs to drive long-term depression (ACEi-\nLTD) specifically onto D1-MSNs. However, it has not yet been determined which specific excitatory and inhibitory\npresynaptic inputs express ACEi-LTD, as NAc MSNs receive a diverse array of long-range excitatory and local\ninhibitory inputs.\n The main goal of this proposal is to determine which specific excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic inputs\nto NAc MSNs express ACEi-LTD, revealing the circuit-specific synaptic plasticity mechanisms evoked by ACEi\nwhich is critical for developing circuit-informed therapies for SUDs. Towards this, excitatory opsins will be\nexpressed virally in an input and cell type-specific manner in individual inputs to the NAc. Whole-cell patch-clamp\nelectrophysiological recordings will be taken from D1- and D2-MSNs while optogenetically stimulating individual\nexcitatory or inhibitory inputs. Optically- and electrically-evoked postsynaptic currents will be measured before,\nduring, and after application of an ACE inhibitor to determine which specific excitatory and inhibitory inputs exhibit\nACEi-LTD. The MOR-dependence of ACEi-LTD will be determined using pharmacological and genetic blockade\nof MOR signaling. Since thalamic inputs to the NAc are known to drive opiate dependence, and since prior\nstudies suggest that ACEi modulates cortical excitatory inputs to the NAc, Aim 1 will investigate the ACEi\nsensitivity of thalamic and cortical excitatory inputs onto MSNs. Additionally, since fast-spiking interneurons\n(FSIs) provide the most robust regulation of MSN output, and since low-threshold spiking interneurons (LTSIs)\nare known to decrease presynaptic release upon MOR-agonist treatment, Aim 2 will investigate the ACEi\nsensitivity of FSI and LTSI inhibitory inputs onto MSNs. This proposal will reveal the circuit-specific effects of\nACEi, which selectively targets D1-MSNs of the NAc that drive reward and contribute to addictive behaviors.\nSince ACEi attenuates fentanyl preference in mice, ACE may be a precise and safe therapeutic target for the\nprevention and/or treatment of SUDs such as opioid use disorder.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nHuntington\u2019s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the striatum, a brain region\nthat controls movement and some forms of cognition. Patients manifest a myriad of motor, cognitive, and\nneuropsychiatric symptoms, the latter being the most burdensome. Apathy is the most prevalent\nneuropsychiatric symptom in HD and is strongly associated with cognitive dysfunction and suicide, which is\nthe third most common cause of death in HD. The treatment of apathy should be a priority in the clinical\ncare of HD patients, but the etiology or pathophysiology of apathy in HD is unknown. The goal of this\nproposal is to fill this gap in knowledge and provide insights into the cellular mechanisms that regulate\napathy in HD. This is crucial to develop effective treatments to prevent unnecessary deaths and improve\nthe quality of life of HD patients. Studies in the general population have shown that systemic inflammation\nand white matter (WM) lesions are risk factors for apathy. Increased inflammation and WM atrophy are\nfound in the striatum of patients and mouse models of HD and we and others have shown that dysfunction\nof striatal astrocytes in HD plays a critical role in these processes. Astrocyte dysfunction has previously\nbeen associated with mood disorders, but whether striatal astrocytes regulate apathy in HD is unknown.\nWe recently showed that a subpopulation of striatal reactive astrocytes expressing the glial fibrillary acidic\nprotein (GFAP+), but not other known astrocyte markers, are clustered around a subset of axon bundles\n(WM fascicles) traversing the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of a mouse model of HD (zQ175), a\nphenomenon that increased with disease severity. The DMS along with regions of the medial prefrontal\ncortex (mPFC) are interconnected and regulate motivation-related behaviors such as apathy. Based on this\nevidence we hypothesize that a specialized population of GFAP+ astrocytes accumulate on WM fascicles\nderived from the mPFC and traversing the DMS in HD, causing WM atrophy and apathy related behaviors.\nTo test this hypothesis, we will conduct three complementary aims: Aim 1) we will identify the origin of WM\nfascicles associated with GFAP+ astrocytes in the DMS of HD mice using anterograde viral tracing\nanalyses from injections conducted in different cortical regions and GFAP immunostaining analyses, Aim\n2) we will characterize the astrocytes associated with WM in the DMS of HD mice using coupled spatial\ntranscriptomics and proteomic analyses using the Nanostring nCounter system, and Aim 3) elucidate the\neffect of ablating WM associated striatal astrocytes in the regulation of WM atrophy and apathy by using an\nastrocyte selective viral expression of the diphtheria toxin fragment A in the DMS of HD mice. Successful\ncompletion of this proposal may reveal a new mechanistic connection between WM atrophy, striatal gliosis,\nand apathy in HD and will serve the basis for future functional characterization analyses of WM-associated\nastrocytes to start uncovering new ways to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nHuntington\u2019s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT\ngene that preferentially affects medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum. HD is primarily characterized as\na motor disease, but it also manifests with cognitive and behavioral deficits that appear well before motor\nsymptoms onset and are considered the most burdensome for patients and caregivers. Cognitive changes in\nHD are most highly associated with functional decline and can be predictive of nursing home placement.\nHowever, the etiology of cognitive decline in HD is significantly understudied. The goal of this proposal is to\nprovide a mechanistic understanding for how cognitive decline arises in HD. The dorsomedial striatum (DMS),\nthe most affected area in HD, has long been recognized as an important structure in the regulation of various\ncognitive functions and its degeneration has been observed in patients with various forms of dementia. The\nstriatum\u2019s function is regulated by two major excitatory glutamatergic inputs: thalamo-striatal (T-S) and cortico-\nstriatal (C-S). T-S synapses contribute to the regulation of cognitive flexibility, working memory, and some\nforms of learning, and are preferentially lost in young HD mice. Studies in HD patients before-clinical motor\ndiagnosis found a strong thalamus\u2013striatum association that significantly co-varies with cognitive performance\nand is predictive of cognitive impairment and disease progression. During the prior research period, we\nestablished a connection between the stability of T-S synapses and Heat Shock transcription Factor 1 (HSF1),\na protein known for its role in protein homeostasis and stress response, in both physiology and HD. In the\nrenewal of this R01 we are seeking to understand how HSF1 participates in the early loss of T-S synapses in\nHD and whether T-S synapse loss leads to cognitive decline in HD. Our preliminary HSF1 ChIP-seq analyses\nin young zQ175 HD mice revealed a deficit in HSF1 DNA binding onto specific postsynaptic scaffolding genes\ninvolved in synapse maintenance and HSF1 RNAi injected in the striatum of WT mice mimicked decreased T-S\nsynapses and impaired cognition as seen in HD mice. Our previous proteomic work also revealed HSF1\ninteracts with unique proteins in HD that negatively influence HSF1 activity. We hypothesize that HSF1\ninteracts with unique proteins in HD that impair HSF1 binding and regulation of genes involved in the formation\nand maintenance of T-S synapses, causing T-S synapse loss and cognitive decline. We will test this\nhypothesis by 1) investigating the mechanism responsible for the alteration of HSF1 DNA-binding in early HD,\n2) assessing how HSF1 regulates the synaptoproteome of T-S synapses, and 3) evaluating the role of HSF1-\nmediated loss of T-S synapses in the dysregulation of striatal synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits in HD.\nSuccessful completion of our work will shed light into the mechanisms responsible for cognitive decline in HD\nand perhaps other forms of dementia in which HSF1 and DMS dysregulation have been observed.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAbstract\nAnimal survival is dependent on locomotion to successfully find shelter, locate a mate, capture prey, and avoid\npredators. Although it is well established that spinal locomotor circuits in vertebrates are activated by\nglutamatergic-mediated excitation, our understanding of glutamatergic signaling is incomplete. This is\nimportant to understand since glutamatergic excitation contributes to the generation of rhythmic activity and the\namplitude of motor output. Dissecting the precise role that subtypes of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate\nreceptors play in spinal locomotor circuit function will provide mechanistic data critical for understanding\nlocomotor circuit function. We will address this gap in knowledge by determining the roles of glutamate\nreceptor subtypes in the larval zebrafish spinal locomotor network using a well-validated complement of tools\nthat span from molecular to behavioral levels, including optogenetic activation of spinal locomotor networks,\npharmacology, electrophysiology, high-speed videography, and calcium imaging. The goal of this proposal is to\nadvance our mechanistic understanding of glutamatergic signaling responsible for regulating the properties of\nvertebrate spinal locomotor output and spinal motor neuron recruitment. The results of these experiments will\nset a foundation for investigations into the specific neuronal targets of glutamatergic actions, revealed here, in\na future R01 proposal. Since many principles of CPG function are conserved across vertebrates, we expect\nthese findings to translate to other animals, including humans.",

Our recent studies determined that the vulnerability\nof aged mice to infection can be overcome with either short term senolytic treatment or genetic\nablation of senescent cells, which reduced SASP levels and supported the development of anti-\nviral responses. This proposal will expand upon these novel findings and develop a mechanistic\nunderstanding of how the senescent cell burden, which increases with age and disease, affects\nthe response of specific immune cell populations after infection. Core B will generate and\nvalidate stocks of acute viruses and expose mice to a diverse microbial milieu via pet store\nmouse fomite bedding. We will produce mouse lines composed of chronologically aged mice\nand comparison young mouse cohorts. We will also characterize and expand novel mouse\nmodels generated by Project 1 in which accelerated aging is driven in specific immune cells and\nin which cells expressing senescence markers p16 and p21 can be identified or inducibly\nablated. Centralizing the breeding, maintenance, and expansion of these different mouse strains\nallows for comparison and standardization of results between the three inter-related projects\nand increased efficiency while reducing cost. Centralizing the infection paradigms and\nemploying quality control standards will increase the rigor of experiments. Lastly, to further\nensure rigor and reproducibility, Core B will utilize a unique data base called MouseCloud, to\ntrack mice and tissues as they are generated and distributed for use by the Projects and Core\nC.

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nMemory CD8 T cells with varying functional characteristics are generated after infection or\nimmunization. We previously defined a population of T cells within the CD62Llo effector memory\ncompartment that express high levels of effector molecules and continue to persist into the\nmemory phase. Although over time in specific pathogen free mice LLECs tend to wane in\nnumber, they represent a substantial fraction of CD8 memory T cells in \u2018dirty mice\u2019 and\ndominate the secondary and tertiary memory pools. Importantly, our prior work showed that\nthese \u2018long-lived effector cells\u2019 (LLEC) are the most robust memory T cells for mediating\nantigen-specific clearance of systemic viral and bacterial pathogens. Our recent RNA\nsequencing data indicates that LLEC may achieve this through unique expression of multiple\nNK cell-associated receptors as well as chemokine and trafficking molecules that may enforce\ntheir strict localization to the vasculature at the steady state. In this proposal we will determine:\n1) if LLECs participate in tissue-initiated infections through either extravasation or from their\nposition within the vasculature, 2) if NK cell receptors modulate LLEC function, and 3) if the\nLLEC subset uniquely thrives during inflammation for its persistence. Our proposal leverages\nrecent transcriptional analysis along with innovative mouse models and technical approaches to\nunderstand the signals governing how circulating memory T cell populations mediate protective\nimmunity.

    "abstract_text": "Human communication crucially depends on the ability to maintain good speech intelligibility in dynamically\nvarying acoustic backgrounds. This ability declines with age and age-related hearing loss. Understanding the\nmechanisms underlying this decline is key to finding successful interventions and potential treatments for this\nwidespread problem of high public-health relevance. Recently, magneto- and electroencephalographic\n(M/EEG) measures have been increasingly used to investigate changes in subcortical and cortical neural\nprocessing due to age and hearing loss. Advances in measurement and data analysis methods enable\ncharacterization of neural tracking of acoustic, and higher-level (linguistic and semantic) speech features from\nM/EEG recordings obtained while study participants listen to continuous speech. These techniques provide a\nunique window into neural tracking of the target speech and to-be-ignored competing background. However,\nthe interpretation of these measures is hampered by poor control for differences in peripheral (cochlear)\nauditory function, lack of direct experimental validation for the role of specific underlying mechanisms, and\noften small study samples. Non-speech stimuli have been used to gain a better understanding of specific\nmechanisms contributing to the age- and hearing-loss-related decline in speech perception but experimental\nevidence that individual or group differences in neurophysiological responses to these stimuli are reflected in\nperception is often lacking. The goal of this proposal is to provide the missing link between measures of\ncortical tracking of temporal envelope fluctuations in non-speech and speech stimuli and performance in\nperceptual tasks, using comparable stimuli. The studies will use young normal-hearing listeners, older normal-\nhearing listeners, and older hearing-impaired listeners. In Aim 1, we will investigate effects of age and hearing\nloss on perceptual measures of modulation-rate selectivity and discrimination using non-speech well-controlled\nstimuli with envelope modulation rates relevant for speech perception. In Aim 2, we will measure cortical\nresponses to the non-speech stimuli used in these perceptual tasks to establish the sensitivity of EEG-based\nmeasures to changes in perception resulting from comparable experimental manipulations. In Aim 3, we will\nestimate cortical responses to speech envelope for natural (continuous) speech stimuli to investigate\ncontributions from loss of cochlear nonlinearity, changes to modulation-rate selectivity and discriminability, and\nchanges to cognitive function to neural processing and perception of masked speech. The outcomes from this\nproject will provide the experimental basis for interpreting noninvasive neural (cortical) measures of temporal-\nenvelope processing, thus advancing our understanding of mechanisms contributing to deficits in speech-in-\nnoise perception experienced by older normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adults. The results from the\nproject will have an impact on the development of potential future interventions and treatments for\ncommunication problems that are widespread among the growing population of older individuals.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nRelapse and craving in addiction are heavily controlled by environmental cues that evoke dynamic motivational\nstates and reinforce actions. Both the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and dopamine (DA) signaling are critical for\nassociative learning processes and cue-driven motivational states. The BLA receives dense dopaminergic\nprojections and is enriched with D1 DA receptors (D1DRs), however BLA DA functions in addiction remain largely\nunexplored. Presentations of cocaine-predictive stimuli increase extracellular DA levels and activate neurons\nwithin the amygdala, while BLA D1DRs influence drug-seeking behaviors and their activation increases\nexcitability of BLA principal neurons - a major target of DA inputs into the BLA. As there are extensive excitatory\nprojections from the BLA to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), if BLA DA and D1-neurons are underlying facets of\nstate dynamics-driven drug seeking behaviors, synaptic strength within this pathway may be uniquely potentiated\nfollowing binge-like cocaine seeking. Understanding the role of BLA activity and DA signaling in drug seeking\nwill reveal novel insight into the brain circuitry that drives emotional learning and addiction-related behaviors to\nprovide a strong scientific framework for investigating mechanisms underlying affective diseases. This proposal\nwill make use of new tools to record and manipulate DA and D1 neurons in the amygdala to investigate\ntheir contributions to dynamic cocaine seeking behaviors (Aim 1) and investigate how binge-like cocaine\nself-administration impacts the functional connectivity of glutamatergic BLA to NAc circuits (Aim 2).\nFirst, I will measure in vivo DA signaling and D1-neuron activity in the BLA during cocaine self-administration\nusing fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that BLA DA transmission and D1-neuron activity will track the\nemergence of dynamic, sensory-guided drug seeking motivational states. I will also optogenetically inhibit BLA\nD1-neurons during the same paradigm to investigate if BLA D1-neurons play a necessary role in state-level\ncontrol of binge-like drug seeking. Finally, in an ex vivo preparation, I will use optogenetics to stimulate the\nterminals of glutamatergic BLA projection neurons in an NAc slice while recording the resulting local field\npotentials after rats undergo cocaine self-administration. These studies will test the hypothesis that BLA-NAc\nexcitatory synaptic strength will be modulated by the pattern of drug use history via drug state-intermittency\ninformation from the BLA. This proposal will establish fundamental principles by which dopaminergic and\nglutamatergic mechanisms interact within the amygdalostriatal system to influence the emergence and control\nof dynamic drug-seeking motivational states.",

The purpose of ICANS detection and prompt\ntreatment is to halt ICANS progression and minimize the risk of brain edema and herniation, the most feared\nsequelae of ICANS resulting in severe cognitive symptoms, coma, ICU stay, intubation, and potentially death.\nCurrent standard-of-care approaches to monitoring for ICANS consist of a brief neurocognitive assessment\nresulting in an immune effector cell-associated encephalopathy (ICE) score indicative of the severity of\ncognitive impairment. However, recent work shows that there is an opportunity to detect ICANS at an earlier\nstage than is currently possible with ICE by monitoring for subtle early changes in speech and language such\nas decreased fluency and coherence, word finding difficulties, and increased repetitiveness of speech. We\nhave developed a Stress, Affect, Language and Speech Analysis (SALSA) system designed to administer and\nanalyze speech-based neurocognitive tests over the telephone. SALSA conducts a conversation with the\npatient and scores the audio received from the patient for several markers of speech fluency, verbal fluency\nand working memory deficits.

We will study the safety and efficacy of antigen-directed,\noff-the-shelf, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NK cells engineered for dual-antigen targeting. We\nhave optimized the differentiation of iPSC-derived CD34+ cells to highly potent NK cells, scaled production at the\nUniversity of Minnesota, and can now produce hundreds of doses in a manufacturing run with a clonal iPSC\ntransduced with a high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (called hnCD16). In late 2019, we initiated clinical trials\ntesting this engineered iPSC product (designated FT516). The overarching hypothesis for this project is that\ndual targeting of NK cells with a CAR and through hnCD16 will protect against relapse after auto-transplant for\nlymphoma and that future gene edits to alter metabolism will enhance adoptive transfer. This hypothesis fits with\nthe themes of this Program, and Project 2 will inform the Program on the development of off-the-shelf NK cells,\nNK CAR, and the role of membrane IL-15, as well as pre-clinically on whether manipulating metabolism will\nenhance NK cell therapy. These investigations are supported by the following Specific Aims. Aim 1 will test dual\ntargeting of NK cells to CD19 and CD20 using two mechanisms of action, ADCC and an NK CAR, to prevent\nrelapse after autologous transplantation for lymphoma. We will test a triple gene-modified iPSC-derived NK cell\nproduct (FT596) transduced with hnCD16, an NK cell-optimized CD19 CAR, and membrane bound 15/IL-15Ra\nfusions. FT596 will be combined with rituximab as maintenance therapy to limit relapse after autologous HCT.\nThis trial is FDA-approved and will first establish an MTD at day +30 after engraftment and then, if single dosing\nis safe, move to day +7 before engraftment with the goal of 3 doses in the first hundred days to prevent relapse.\nAim 2 will test enhancement of NK cell metabolic fitness by ARID5B overexpression and CD38 knockout. Our\npreliminary data shows both adaptive NK cells and CD38 knockout iPSC-derived NK cells resist oxidative stress-\ninduced cell death. ARID5B overexpression, naturally increased in adaptive NK cells, mediates similar effects.\nWe will generate new iPSC lines to build on FT596 with transgenic expression of ARID5B or a CRISPR knockout\nof CD38. These clones will be evaluated to probe the mechanisms on how they drive NK cell metabolism and\naugment function.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nHigh blood pressure (BP), particularly systolic BP (SBP), is the major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular\ndiseases (CVD) and related conditions such as chronic kidney disease and cognitive decline/dementia. In fact,\n~60% of adults in the United States have above-normal SBP (\u2265120 mmHg). Above-normal SBP is associated\nwith vascular endothelial dysfunction, a key antecedent for developing CVD. In addition, rates of BP control\ncontinue to worsen, predicting a new epidemic of disorders driven by above-normal SBP unless innovative\ntherapies with clinical efficacy for lowering SBP can be adopted by and translated to the public.\nHigh-resistance inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) is a novel, low-barrier, time-efficient, lifestyle\nintervention involving repeated inhalations against resistance with a hand-held device. In a randomized,\ndouble-blind, sham-controlled, parallel group design, pilot study in men and women (n=36) with initial SBP\n\u2265120 mmHg, I showed that IMST (30 breaths/day [~5 min/day] at 75% maximal inspiratory pressure [PIMAX], 6\ndays/week for 6 weeks) had excellent adherence (94% of prescribed training sessions completed), increased\ninspiratory muscle strength (~20% increase in PIMAX), lowered SBP by 9 mmHg, and improved vascular\nendothelial function by ~45% compared to low-resistance sham training \u2013 thus establishing the clinical efficacy\nof high-resistance IMST. However, this trial was performed with frequent researcher supervision and feedback.\nTherefore, the next step in the overall translation of IMST for improving public health is to establish a vehicle\nfor dissemination of IMST by utilizing digital health technologies.\nIn this R03 application, I propose to pilot-test a smartphone app that independently guides users through an\nIMST intervention. I will directly compare the efficacy of 6 weeks (30 breaths/day, 6 days/week, 75% PIMAX) of\nat-home, app-guided IMST vs. an established clinic-based, investigator-supervised IMST program. I\nhypothesize that at-home IMST with a smartphone app will lower SBP, improve vascular endothelial function,\npromote adherence and increase inspiratory muscle strength to a similar extent as clinic-based IMST. I also\nwill utilize an innovative follow-up period in which adherence to IMST and changes in home SBP are monitored\nfor an additional 12 months after completing the randomized controlled trial, under free-living conditions, in all\nstudy participants; this will provide invaluable real-world data to inform future trial designs.\nAim 1: To determine changes in home SBP after 6 weeks of at-home or clinic-based IMST in men and women\nwith above-normal SBP at baseline. Safety and tolerability also will be assessed.\nAim 2: To measure a) adherence; b) the change in PIMAX; and c) the change in vascular endothelial function\nafter 6 weeks of at-home or clinic-based IMST.\nAim 3: To monitor adherence to IMST and changes in home SBP during a 12-month free-living follow-up\nperiod in which all participants are given unrestricted access to the IMST smartphone app and training device.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY (Overall)\nA lag between biomedical research discoveries and the implementation of findings in clinical care is widely\nrecognized and primarily attributed to a disconnect between researchers and practitioners. One study found\nthat over the course of 17 years, only 14% of clinical research findings led to direct patient benefit. A reason\nresearch findings are often do not implemented in clinical practice is because health services research takes\nplace over extended timeframes and researchers place an emphasis on publishing their findings in scientific\njournals with less attention to application. Moreover, most researchers are typically external to healthcare\nsystems, conducting their research in universities or research firms. Closing the gap in translating research\nfindings to clinical care requires a new way of conducting research by embedding researchers in health care\nsystems, allowing them to engage in rapid, iterative learning in which evidence informs practice, and practice\ninforms evidence. The vision of the proposed Learning Health System Embedded Scientist Training and\nResearch (LHS E-STaR) of the North (LEaRN) Center is to leverage and extend existing infrastructure and\npartnerships established at the University of Minnesota (UMN) under the Minnesota Learning Health System\nK12 Mentored Career Development Program (MN-LHS) and its Center for Learning Health System Sciences\n(MN-CLHSS). The LEaRN Center will accelerate the professional development and patient-centered outcomes\nand comparative effectiveness research (PCOR/CER) conducted by specially trained, embedded LHS\nresearchers in the Minnesota health care system and beyond. The LEaRN Center represents a partnership\nbetween UMN and five hub partner sites with established traditions of academic excellence and collaboration\nbetween clinicians and embedded scientists with demonstrated success achieving the long-term goal to\nexpand and diversify the LHS-research trained workforce. Led by MPIs Timothy Beebe and Genevieve\nMelton-Meaux, the LEaRN Center will leverage the unique strengths of five hub partners to provide diverse\ndidactic and experiential research and training opportunities to LHS scientists to equip them with the LHS tools\nand expertise to make meaningful differences in health care settings serving children, the elderly,\nunder-represented and rural populations, Veterans, and individuals with multiple disorders. The LEaRN Center\nwill address five Aims: leverage and expand existing LHS infrastructure and partnerships to identify and\nnurture a new generation of embedded LHS scholars (Aim 1); enhance the diversity of LHS scientists, their\nscience and their mentors (Aim 2); create a novel LHS infrastructure that supports the conduct, dissemination,\nimplementation, and use of PCOR/CER in healthcare system (Aim 3); create learning communities and\nnetworks to convene, deliberate, and share knowledge (Aim 4); and implement a rigorous system for program\nevaluation and improvement (Aim 5).

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:\nEmergency general surgery (EGS) - accounting for 11% of US hospital admissions; over 50% of operative\nmortality; the highest risk, acuity, rate of complications, and cost in general surgery - particularly the subset of\nemergency laparotomy (EL) patients which suffer the worst EGS outcomes - is increasingly recognized as a\npublic health crisis. While enhanced recovery programs (ERPs) have dramatically advanced pre-, intra-, and\ninpatient postoperative evidenced-based best practices (EBPs), ERPs have largely ignored subsequent\npostoperative home-based recovery. Despite certain postoperative complications occurring commonly after\ndischarge (notably over 40% of surgical site infections [SSI]), recovery for surgical patients once discharged to\nhome remains understudied and ripe for improvement and innovation, especially as surgical care models\nincreasingly shift greater proportions of postoperative recovery into the home-based setting. Digital solutions\nfor remote monitoring, patient engagement/education, and surgical prediction show promise but are used\nminimally for surgical recovery. We hypothesize that well-designed technology solutions for EL home- and\ntransition-based workflows engaging diverse stakeholders will empower EL patients, their caregivers, and care\nteams to achieve optimal outcomes and safe recovery. The goal of REST-PSLL (Re-engineering Surgical\nRecovery and Transitions Using Technology Patient Safety Learning Laboratory) is to apply systems\nengineering approaches to co-produce innovative and scalable patient- and care team-centric solutions for EL\nhome-based recovery. REST-PSLL has the following specific aims. Aim 1: Identify barriers and facilitators to\nideal at-home recovery for patients following EL. We will engage stakeholders using the Systems Engineering\nfor Patient Safety (SEIPS) model to identify and evaluate factors to understand barriers and facilitators of\noptimal care and postoperative complications with a focus on SSI. Aim 2: Iteratively design and develop new\nprocesses, tools, and technologies that help remove or reduce barriers to ideal at-home recovery. We will use\nswimlane diagrams to then analyze for areas of improvement to generate initial design requirements and\nprototypes for tools/technologies followed by iterative user-centered design to specify design requirements,\ndevelop solutions, and conduct end-user testing at our clinical sites. Aim 3: Implement and evaluate solutions\nin practice. Perform pilot testing and implementation, assess primary (addressing or avoiding trigger/potential\nissue, solution us) and secondary outcomes guided by RE-AIM framework; evaluate implementation phases\nguided by EPIS implementation framework to generate implementation learnings and solution revision plan(s).\nREST-PSLL is poised to be highly successful and impactful, highlighted by: a) anticipated learnings that can be\nextrapolated to other surgical populations; b) use of transdisciplinary complementary systems expertise and\napproaches; c) deep clinical expertise; d) patient- and caregiver- co-production; and e) expanding or\noptimizing existing solutions/platforms.",

The LHS E-STaR of the North (LEaRN) Research\nEducation Core (REC) will develop scientists capable of strengthening the rigor and application of research\nevidence and of improving the implementation of innovative practices in health care organizations. The LEaRN\nREC will leverage and expand the infrastructure established under the Minnesota Learning Health System K12\nMentored Career Development Program (MN-LHS) to train a diverse group of LHS scientists who embed\nthemselves into health care operations and bring value to decision-making processes by conducting rigorous\nresearch responsive to the needs of clinical practices and patients. The MN-LHS has been exceptionally\nsuccessful, training 14 LHS scientists (clinicians, clinician investigators, and doctoral-level scholars) from five\nhealthcare delivery systems and representing primary care, subspecialties, nursing, pharmacy, anthropology,\nsociology, engineering, biostatistics, and epidemiology. Substantial institutional support will accelerate the\ncreation of a community of LHS scientists, ensure that the scientists are exposed to a wider range of questions\nemerging from clinical practice, and offer diverse opportunities for authentic embeddedness. The LHS\nscientists emerging from the LEaRN Center REC will be prepared to balance the demand for rapidly\ngenerated, practical evidence with the rigors of peer-review and scientific standards, rapidly translating\nresearch to improve clinical practice and patient outcomes. The overarching goals of the LEaRN REC are to\nprovide 1) tailored educational experiences that leverage an existing, robust educational infrastructure, 2) a\nnovel competency-based curricula, and 3) health system partners that will serve as learning \u201clabs\u201d for LHS\nresearch, offering unrivaled expertise in training embedded clinical scientists using patient-centered LHS\nphilosophies and methods. The goals of the LEaRN REC will be achieved by pursuing three aims: leverage\nand expand our MN-LHS program, identifying and educating a new generation of embedded LHS scholars for\nindependent research careers in patient-centered and community engaged research (Aim 1); enhance the\ndiversity of LHS scientists, their science, and their mentors (Aim 2); and cultivate engagement opportunities to\nensure the LEaRN REC is responsive to the needs of patients, communities, and health systems (Aim 3).

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe goals of this proposal are to help Sasha Prisco, MD, PhD, a cardiovascular physician-scientist, transition\nto independence and to further the understanding of mechanisms of right ventricular dysfunction in pulmonary\narterial hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive vasculopathy which increases right\nventricular afterload, leading to right ventricular failure. Right ventricular function is the greatest predictor of\nsurvival in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Unfortunately, there are no current pharmacologic therapies that\ndirectly target the failing right ventricle. Our recent preclinical data demonstrated pathological inflammation\nthrough activation of the cytokine receptor glycoprotein 130 induced deleterious microtubule remodeling,\ndownregulation of junctophilin-2 (an essential protein that maintains t-tubule structure and function), and\ndepressed right ventricular function in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Emerging data show alterations in gut\nmicrobiota disrupt the intestinal barrier, which permits bacterial translocation, and subsequently activates\nsystemic inflammation, suggesting that modulating the microbiome may be an approach to mitigate\ninflammation. We recently identified that modifying the gut microbiome with intermittent fasting improved right\nventricular function and postulate that increased abundance of Lactobacillus underlies these benefits. We will\ntest the hypothesis that Lactobacillus supplementation combats pathological gut dysbiosis, which prevents\nimmune cell activation, and subsequent glycoprotein 130-mediated microtubule remodeling in the following\nspecific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if Lactobacillus supplementation mitigates pathological microtubule\nremodeling and enhances right ventricular function in two rodent models of pulmonary arterial hypertension,\nmonocrotaline and Sugen-hypoxia. In Aim 2, we will investigate the effects of Lactobacillus supplementation on\ngut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation. For this proposal, we will use a variety of approaches from\nmetagenomics analysis of the gut microbiome, SomaScan proteomics, and single-cell RNA-sequencing to\nhistological assessments, echocardiography, invasive hemodynamics, and treadmill exercise testing. This\nproject has the potential to identify a novel therapeutic approach for pulmonary arterial hypertension.",

My graduate research suggests that females are more\nsensitive to the rewarding effects of aggressive experience and that oxytocin (OT) transmission may underlie\nthese sex differences. My recent post-doctoral studies support synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)\nand nucleus accumbens (NAc) underlies the adaptive consequences of aggressive experience. Thus, the goal\nof this proposal is to synthesize my research by 1) acquiring training in state-of-the-art electrophysiological\ntechniques and investigate aggression-induced synaptic plasticity of PFC input to medium spiny neurons\n(MSNs) in the NAc, and 2) then apply these new skills to assess the contribution of OT to synaptic plasticity of\nNAc MSNs. Both phases will advance our understanding of the causal role of two distinct circuits in driving\naggression reward in both sexes, and provide the training and resources to establish my independent career.\n Under the collective mentorship of Drs. Patrick Rothwell (primary mentor), Robert Meisel (co-mentor),\nstate-of-the-art research facilities, and expert research consultants, I will have access to a unique and custom\nset of resources. Dr. Rothwell will lead my training in slice electrophysiology, optogenetics and calcium\nimaging with fiber photometry. To elucidate specific components of neuronal physiology, I will learn how to\nmeasure the effects of aggressive experience on basal synaptic strength of NAc MSNs in male and female\nSyrian hamsters. I will then assess the effects of aggressive experience on calcium signaling of NAc MSNs in\nmale and females. In combination, I will also utilize optogenetics to assess the involvement of PFC glutamate\nprojections in driving physiological changes and aggression reward in males and females. I predict enhanced\nPFC synaptic transmission onto NAc MSN drives aggressive experience-dependent behavioral plasticity, e.g.\naggression reward and motivation.\n For the R00 phase I will establish an independent research lab and then implement the skills acquired\nduring the K99 to investigate the role of OT in NAc synaptic plasticity, as well as driving aggression reward and\nmotivation in males and females. OT has been historically considered a monotonic love hormone. However,\nthis proposal seeks to further revolutionize our understanding of the non-canonical and non-monotonic nature\nof OT and improve sex-specific therapeutic strategies to combat psychiatric disease. I predict OT is a mediator\nof the NAc MSN synaptic plasticity that drives the enhanced aggression reward and motivation in females\ncompared to males. Collectively, this proposal will provide me skills and professional development for running\na research lab that makes fundamental discoveries about brain function to combat mental illnesses.",

Fluorescently labeled pMHCII tetramers have been used to detect\nCD4+ T cells of known specificity, aiding the study of these populations. However,\npMHCII tetramers do not detect CD4+ T cells with TCRs at the low end of the\nbiologically relevant affinity spectrum. The affinity of CD4 for MHCII is below the limit of\ndetection. We used directed evolution to strengthen the interaction between MHCII and\nCD4, thereby stabilizing TCR-pMHCII interactions while still retaining the cognate\nspecificity. pMHCII tetramers engineered for enhanced CD4 binding outperformed\nconventional tetramers in detecting cognate T cells, including the ones with low affinity\nTCRs. The overall goal of this project is to exploit this enhanced binding by high\naffinity 4E reagents in immunotherapies. The premise underlying this project is that\nrecruitment of all antigen-specific CD4 T cells including the ones with low affinity TCRs\nwill improve responses generated by vaccines, whereas deletion of these T cells could\ntreat autoimmunity. The goal here is to use the high affinity 4E reagents to activate or\ninactivate T cells based on the clinical need. In Aim 1 we will assess the efficacy of\npMHCII-4E reagents to specifically deplete auto-reactive CD4 T cells in a murine\nmodel of multiple sclerosis, Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE). Both\nin-vitro and in-vivo depletion followed by EAE induction will be attempted.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nEukaryotic cells are home to a diversity of organelles, symbionts, and pathogens that are often co-inherited\nacross cell lineages and from parent to progeny. Across humans, animal models, and arthropod vectors of\npathogens, intracellular microbial community dynamics are associated with numerous effects on host\nphysiology that ultimately result in disease. These include mitochondrial diseases, exacerbated clinical\nsymptoms of co-acquired pathogens, altered transmission dynamics of vector-borne pathogens, interactive\neffects on host immunity and metabolism, and even dysbiosis of the host gut microbiome. There is great\ninterest in defining the factors that promote or inhibit co-inheritance of intracellular bacteria due to the\ncombination of their direct and indirect effects on animal health and for their potential use as anti-pathogen\nagents. We propose to use a suite of insect models to investigate the factors that regulate co-inheritance of\nintracellular microbes with a focus on Wolbachia: alpha-proteobacteria, related to the intracellular human\npathogens Anaplasma, Rickettsia, and Ehrlichia. Unlike their close relatives, Wolbachia inhabit the cells of\narthropods and nematodes and manipulate host biology to facilitate vertical transmission via the maternal\ngermline. The consequences of Wolbachia infections are diverse and include reproductive isolation between\nhost populations, matriline sweeps, protection against secondary infections with pathogens, and even host\nspeciation. Furthermore, some arthropods harbor multiple, stably co-transmitted strains of Wolbachia that must\ncompete for host resources and space in the germline. Importantly, these Wolbachia-mediated phenotypes are\ncurrently being applied to manage vector-borne pathogens, and, there is significant applied interest in\nleveraging coinfections of Wolbachia to fine-tune and expand management programs. Given the applied\ninterest in Wolbachia and its broad success as an endosymbiont of ecdysozoans, they are an attractive model\nfor understanding the mechanisms of coinfection. Our long-term goals are to define the mechanisms behind\nhost-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions that ultimately determine inheritance and evolution of these\nassociations. This proposal derives from our published work and preliminary data that has given us techniques\nto manipulate and track intracellular infections, our ability to perturb a naturally stable coinfection, and our\ndiscovery that intra-organismal niche partitioning plays a key role in coinfection stability. We propose to use a\ncombination of techniques including high throughput analysis of transcriptomes, multiplexing spectral\nmicroscopy, and molecular and cell biology approaches to accomplish the following Specific Aims: (1) Define\nfactors that facilitate co-establishment of intracellular microbes, (2) Identify features of stable coinfections that\nfacilitate evolutionary stability. We anticipate this work will identify conserved mechanisms that regulate\nintracellular infections, as well as provide foundational knowledge to support the development of therapeutic\nstrategies focused on intracellular microbes.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nSexual reproduction evolved more than one billion years ago, shortly after the appearance of eukaryotes. Sex\nis theorized to be an important aspect of creating genetic variation, adapting to new environments, and in\nremoving disadvantageous traits from the gene pool. Despite this, many eukaryotes have reverted to asexual\nreproductive strategies. Importantly, such transitions to asexual reproduction have huge evolutionary impacts:\nwe see regular examples of this in the rapid spread of invasive, pathogenic, and drug-resistant organisms.\nUnfortunately, such transitions are notoriously difficult to mechanistically interrogate due to their lack of\nexperimental tractability and the fact that many reversions to asexuality are quite ancient. However, arthropods\nare rich in recently acquired vertically inherited microbes (e.g., Wolbachia, Rickettsia, and Cardinium) that\nconvert their arthropod hosts to asexual reproduction. So-called \u201cparthenogenesis induction\u201d has been\nreinvented multiple times across these bacteria and relies on microbial mechanisms for impacting host meiosis\nor mitosis to alter ploidy. We can manipulate these recently asexual lineages in the lab to mechanistically\ndefine the cell biology of asexual reproduction. Furthermore, because there are numerous independent\ntransitions to microbe-mediated asexuality, and lineages will slowly undergo a loss of sexual function, we can\nuse this system to track the genomic and mechanistic consequences of lost sex. The long-term goal of my lab\nis to link mechanistic processes of mitosis, meiosis, and reproduction to long-term organismal and genomic\nconsequences. This proposal describes my lab\u2019s research goals across the next five years, which\ninclude: (1) mechanistically characterizing bacterial proteins mediating asexual reproduction, (2)\nidentifying mitotic- and meiotic- effector proteins across diverse bacteria and reproductive biologies,\nand (3) using forward genetics to map the genomic consequences of lost sex. Specifically, our creative\ninterdisciplinary research plan integrates genomic approaches (e.g., genome sequencing, comparative\ngenomics, quantitative trait loci mapping), molecular approaches in non-model organisms, and genetics in\ntractable model systems (e.g., yeast, Drosophila). We will build on our recent discovery of the first putative\nasexuality inducing bacterial effector proteins to broadly define how microbes have evolved to manipulate\nmitosis and meiosis, and disentangle the causes of reproductive switches from the consequences. In addition\nto the broad significance of reproduction, these systems afford new opportunities to understand fundamental\naspects of cell biology that underly many human-health relevant processes. For example, defects in mitosis\nare typical of certain degenerative conditions and cancers, and changes in ploidy significantly contribute to\nfungal pathogenesis and drug resistance. Our focus on novel mechanisms for altering reproduction and cell\ndivision will support the development of new therapeutic avenues across a range of systems.",

Despite the unique needs\nof American Indian caregivers, few resources support this group in a culturally appropriate way. The Savvy\nCaregiver Program is a multi-component, psychoeducational program consisting of 6 weekly 2-hour sessions for\nfamily caregivers of people living with dementia at home.

Six sequential talking circles will be held\nwith 5-8 previous American Indian dementia caregivers who are enrolled members of White Earth Nation (Aim\n1) to develop the Savvy Caregiver Peer Program prototype.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nPhantom limb pain is common after amputation, but the mechanisms and associated factors contributing to this\npain remain unclear. Without an understanding of associated factors, it is difficult for clinicians to recommend\neffective pain treatments. The long-term goal of this research is to better understand contributing factors to\nphantom limb pain on an individual level to guide effective, personalized treatment approaches in the future.\nThe overall objective of this project is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of the ecological momentary\nassessment (EMA) method in measuring person-centered factors contributing to phantom limb pain. EMA is a\nsystematic survey methodology to evaluate real-time personal and environmental factors in an individual\u2019s\nnatural environment. The hypothesis is that EMA surveys will achieve at least 80% retention rate and 75%\nresponse rate in the amputation population. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims. Aim 1:\nInvestigate factors contributing to phantom limb pain among individuals with amputations. The\napproach for this aim will be to conduct focus group sessions with individuals with amputations to discuss their\nexperiences with phantom limb pain and any aggravating or relieving factors. Data from the focus groups will\nbe used to refine a list of EMA questions on phantom limb pain contributing factors. Aim 2: Determine the\nfeasibility and acceptability of EMA to identify phantom limb pain factors. The approach for this aim will\nbe to use repeated EMA surveys to measure phantom limb pain and its contributing factors in individuals with\namputations in real time and in their natural environment. Responses to EMA questions will be analyzed to\nexplore factors that contribute to phantom limb pain in each participant. The feasibility and acceptability of this\nmethod in this population will be determined using recruitment rate, retention rate, response rate, and semi-\nstructured interviews with participants. This proposed research will contribute to science through an improved\nunderstanding of contributing factors to phantom limb pain after amputation and the establishment of feasibility\nand acceptability of the EMA method in measuring these factors. These contributions are expected to be\nsignificant because the systematic identification of patient-specific factors will guide informed future treatment\nrecommendations for effective, personalized medicine for phantom limb pain, addressing a critical public health\nneed. This research is part of a comprehensive training plan that includes advanced coursework on qualitative\nresearch and causal discovery data analysis, professional development through seminars, networking, and\nresearch dissemination, and mentored training in the research skills needed to continue the applicant\u2019s\ntrajectory to becoming an independent researcher. The University of Minnesota\u2019s expansive research\ninfrastructure, the multidisciplinary doctoral program in Rehabilitation Science, and the Minneapolis Adaptive\nDesign and Engineering laboratory create an ideal environment for completing this research and training.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCocaine use disorder (CUD) is a chronic relapsing disease that leads to neuroadaptations in energy homeostasis\nafter repeated drug exposure. There is currently no FDA-approved treatment that lowers the risk of relapse in\nCUD. Reported annual deaths involving cocaine have nearly quintupled in the United States from 4,939 in 2013\nto 24,538 in 2021, making this a major public health concern. Despite recent scientific advances elucidating\ncritical neuronal circuitry and biological conditions that drive cocaine-seeking behaviors, the development of\ninterventions to disrupt the repeating cycle of addiction has proved more difficult. The operant behavioral model\nof drug self-administration, extinction, and cue-induced reinstatement emulates cue priming and drug craving in\npatients in recovery experiencing settings, cues, or memories associated with past drug use. Craving and relapse\nof cocaine seeking is driven by glutamatergic (Glu) neurotransmission in the NAcC, observed in both humans\nand animal models. Clinically, susceptibility to cocaine relapse is notably higher in female patients with reports\nof stronger craving to cocaine-paired cues. This significant sex difference, also reflected in animal models of\nCUD, represents an obstacle in treatment development that yields therapeutic benefit across sexes. Our lab has\ndemonstrated that metformin (MET), an FDA-approved Type II Diabetes (T2D) treatment, has pre-clinical\npromise in reducing cue-induced cocaine reinstatement after a period of withdrawal when administered\nintracranially in both female and male rats. My own preliminary data shows that systemic metformin reduces the\nconditioned rewarding effects of cocaine in male rats. In T2D, MET improves glucose management in part\nthrough activation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), which when phosphorylated,\nrestores the intracellular ratio of AMP to ATP in response to environmental stressors. AMPK is decreased in the\nnucleus accumbens core (NAcC) after chronic exposure to cocaine, with MET-induced increases in AMPK\nactivity thus providing a promising putative mechanism of action. Still, it remains unknown how oral MET is\nbiodistributed to the NAcC and how it may impact critical Glu circuitry underlying cocaine relapse events. This\nstudy will explore the therapeutic potential of MET by defining central pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics\nof oral MET in the NAcC. This proposal tests the hypotheses that oral administration of MET will: 1) have a more\nrobust effect in reducing cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior after self-administration in male rats as\ncompared to female rats, 2) reduce cue-induced reinstatement via activation of AMPK, and 3) augment Glu\nneurotransmission in the NAcC reducing the signal to noise of cue-associated glutamate transmission as\nmeasured by in vivo fiber photometry. The goal of the proposed work is to provide significant evidence that\nsupports the potential repurposing of MET as a treatment for CUD.",

Most pediatric prevention programs focus on\nkey modifiable physical health behaviors like physical activity, diet, and more recently sleep. While important\ncomponents for prevention, the physical health focus can overlook the importance of mental health and\nwellbeing as a preventative factor for cardiovascular disease development. The omittance of intervention\nexplicitly aimed at preventing depression has been highlighted by the recent substantial increases in rates of\nyouth depression symptoms. To reduce the number of youth at high risk for developing CVD, we need to\ncreate accessible and appealing prevention interventions that synergistically address youth mental and\nphysical health needs and have realistic pathways to large-scale dissemination. To address this critical need,\nDr. Arlinghaus designed an afterschool program that uses a mentorship model to simultaneously address\nmental and physical health among youth. While well-liked, challenges regarding intervention reach\nencountered during the proof-of-concept study require further revision and augmentation. Dr. Arlinghaus\u2019s K01\nproject will return to the design phase of intervention optimization and work with current and new school sites\nto augment and revise the intervention to increase its reach and impact. Preliminary testing of the intervention\nwill be conducted at the new school sites to identify needs for further revisions and harmonize research\nmethodologies to prepare for a future fully-powered, real-world efficacy trial. Specifically, Dr. Arlinghaus will\nuse informative qualitative methods to collaboratively identify intervention augmentations and revision with\nstakeholders to improve intervention reach and impact (Aim 1), and will then conduct a two year quasi-\nexperimental crossover pilot trial to characterize the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact on physical\nactivity and depression outcomes among adolescents and young adult mentors (aim 2). These research aims\nwill provide hands-on-experience for Dr. Arlinghaus to apply didactic training in qualitative methods skills,\ncontent area knowledge of the connection between mental health and physical activity, accelerometry skills,\nand community-based intervention study design and implementation. She will be supported by a\nmultidisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in each of these areas. This proposal addresses NHLBI\npriorities to optimize novel cardiovascular disease prevention strategies and implementation research and\nidentify how community-based implementation strategies can address cardiovascular disease inequities.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nRecent technological advances have enabled the production of vast amounts of diverse multi-omics data types (e.g.,\ngenomics, epigenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics) of complex diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases\nand neurodegenerative disorders. The integration of multi-omics data from those heterogeneous diseases can help\nin unraveling the underlying biological mechanisms at multiple omics data levels, in improving prediction of clinical\noutcomes, and to transform medicine, but at the same time presents significant challenges to identify important\nbiomarkers from a large size of heterogeneous molecular data points (i.e. hundreds of thousands). We will\ndevelop and apply novel and powerful Bayesian statistical learning methods that will capture linear and nonlinear\nrelationships of multi-omics data. The methods will be used to identify i) important predictive pathways and\ntheir corresponding important molecules; ii) clinically meaningful molecular disease subtypes, and iii) predictive\nand prognostic biomarkers that contribute to the joint association (or regulatory networks) between omics data\ntypes. The proposed method will be applied to multiple publicly available datasets such as The Cancer Genome\nAtlas, dbGAP, and Genotype-Tissue Expression, and to non public data sets obtained from our collaborators. We\nwill develop robust, computationally efficient, and user-friendly software free of charge for the application of our\nmethods.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nOur overall goals are focus on the prevention and treatment of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) via innate lymphoid\ntype 2 cell (ILC2) anti-inflammatory and tissue reparative properties. We found that host ILC2s in are eliminated\nby total body irradiation {TBI} or chemotherapy and remain depleted for at >/=90 days. This finding is highly\nrelevant as there is an inverse correlation between peripheral blood activated ILC2s and GVHD. As such. we\nsought to determine whether supplemental infusion of mature donor ILC2s could be used to prevent murine\nGVHD. We showed for the first time that donor ILC2s could prevent or partially treat GVHD in an amphiregulin\n(AREG) dependent process. Whether AREG or ILC2 direct contact with intestinal stem cells {ISC) supports small\nintestine epithelial cell repair in TBI treated mice or organoids is unknown. Additionally, third-party ILC2 infusion\nalso significanUy reduced murine GVHD lethality. lmportanUy for translational purposes, we found ILC2s to be\nrelatively steroid resistant. Peri-BMT {bone marrow transplant) IL-33 increased ST2/IL33R+ ILC2s at BMT day\n0 and reduced GVHD. Ko mice had accelerated GVHD; IL-33 given pre-BMT prevented the full lLC2 loss. IL-33\nko recipients have hypo-proliferative epithelial cells, reduced ISCs and Paneth cells, and smaller crypt height\nand numbers. Ex vivo intestine organoid culture modeling revealed that IL-33 coordinated regeneration by\ninducing epidermal growth factor (EGF), significantly reduced by TBI. EGF restored ISC deficiency, uncovering\na gut repair IL-33/EGF loop between ISCs and Paneth cells. Donor IL-13 ko ILC2s or host IL 13Ra ko mice had\nreduced GVHD. ILC2 IL 13 supports both ST2+ tuft cells and goblet cells. Tuft cells produce IL-25 driving ILC2\nproduction and survival. TBI markedly reduced tuft cells for :!:38 days and ko recipients had a striking increase\nin GVHD. When given to wildtype mice exogenous IL-25 significantly reduced GVHD. Consequences of ko of\ntuft cells (and ILC2s) on donor T cell expansion, trafficking and function are unknown. The role of IL-25 and\nIL 17RB has not been examined. We will address the dynamics and interplay between ILC2, IL-33 and\nhost intestinal cells (tuft cells, ISCs, Paneth cells) after TBI and during GVHD.\nAim 1 will test the hypothesis that: Donor ILC2 repopulation fails due to destruction of ILC2 BM niche\nthat supports ILC2s. In vitro pre-lLC2 differentiation, maturation and expansion \u00b1 proinflammatory\ncytokines and ILC2 supporting cytokines will be studied. GATA3-GFPhi pre-lLC2s/mature ILC2s transfer\ninto lethally irradiated congenic BMT recipients will provide data on the differential ability to repopulate the\nBM. If the BM cannot support pre-lLC2s/lLC2s, we will study stem cell deficient mice. Aim 2 will test the\nhypothesis that: Pre-lLC2s/lLC2s and their secreted products have direct effects on intestinal cell subsets.\nIntestinal organoid cultures from wild-type and IL-33 ko mice with syngeneic Tregs and ILC2s will measure\norganoid size, number, and gene expression related to proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and specific\nepithelial lineage markers under homeostasis or after TBI. Anti-AREG mAbs or co-cultures with AREG ko\nlymphocytes will be characterized for promoting epithelial regeneration. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that: Tuft\ncells are essential for ILC2 development and survival via an ILC2 release of IL-13 that stimulates tuft cells to\nrelease IL-25 that causes ILC2 proliferation (aim 3). Tuft cell and ILC2 ko hosts have accelerated GVHD. We\nhypothesize that IL-25 effects are due to direct stimulation of ILC2s or alternatively, with donor IL-17RB+ T\ncells.\nSignificance. Studies in the R37 extension phase will provide fundamental information as to the mechanisms\nby which peri-BMT IL-33 diminish GVHD lethality via effects on ST2+ host ILC2s and regulatory T cells,\nboth of which produce AREG, and the EGF/IL-33 loop that occurs between ISCs and Paneth cells resulting in\nsmall intestine repair. Further, the key role of host ILC2s in subduing GVHD, the nature of post-BMT ILC2\ndeficiency that occurs after pre-BMT conditioning regimens and predisposes patients to GVHD, and the\nessential requirement for tuft cells or their product, IL-25 will be elucidate. LasUy, critical insights will be\ngained as to the inability of pre-lLC2s generation, gut migration or differentiation.\nTranslational Impact: The efficacy of donor and third-party ILC2 infusion in preventing and treating GVHD\nsupport our planned human ILC2 clinical trial, funded via other auspices, that will infuse \"off-the-shelf' third\nparty ILC2s to treat steroid refractory gut GVHD, that portends a particularly poor prognosis, in a 2-\ninstitutional study at the University of Minnesota and UNC-CH.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract: This renewal continues our optimization of regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy for creating transplant\ntolerance to prevent graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Our first-in-human phase I CD4 thymic Treg (tTreg) and CD4\ninducible Treg (iTreg) trials that showed reduction but not elimination of GVHD. Importantly, relapse rates were\nnot improved and decreasing GVHD but not relapse is an insufficient outcome. In this renewal, we will build\non our exciting finding that Tregs can acquire super-suppressor function and by incorporating an anti-CD19 scFv\nCAR (CAR19) increase their potency of killing. In other studies, we developed highly suppressive CAR19 CD8\niTregs that have an intrinsic killing mechanism. Comparing the relative efficacy of these cell types, alone or in\ncombination, will allow us to initiate clinical trials using one product simultaneously suppress GVHD and\nparadoxically kill lymphoma, solving the 2 major alloHCT limitations. A commonality in the diverse\napproaches and Treg subsets that acquire super-suppressor function is the presence of a striking metabolic\neffects. We discovered that targeting selected cell surface or intracellular proteins led to mitochondria fusion,\nhigh oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and super-suppressor Tregs. Polar metabolite analytics pointed to\nkey KEGG pathways [serine-glycine-one carbon network], linked by methionine and folate cycles, trans-\nsulfuration for glutathione, and alanine-aspartate-L-glutamate. A net result is one-carbon (1C) methyl, formyl, or\nmethyl group transfer for biosynthesis, control of gene expression and damaging redox reactions. CAR19\nexpressing CD4 tTregs and human CD8 iTregs that are highly suppressive and cytolytic to hCD19+ targets will\nbe studied in GVHD/GVL models. Notably, whereas activated CAR19 CTLs can cause severe cytokine release\nsyndrome (CRS), our preliminary data indicate that CAR19 CD4 tTregs produce low inflammatory cytokines and\ndo not cause CRS. Aim 1A tests the hypothesis that metabolic reprogramming of Tregs depends on purine\nsynthesis, mitochondria fusion and OXPHOS, and glutathione for redox balance. Aim 1B exploits Tregs\nwith 4-1BB vs CD28 and CD2) signaling domains that affect metabolic reprogramming and Treg\npersistence for optimal GVHD/GVL. Aim 2 is focused on the killing mechanisms that these Treg subsets use\nto lyse targets. Toward that end, we recently discovered CTL supramolecular attack particles (SMAPs) as a new\nmechanism for more sustained killing. SMAPs are cytotoxic core-shell particles that contain granzyme B and\nperforin and are secreted after triggering the immunological synapse (IS), the contact signaling point for T cells\nand APC. Identifying integrated IS signals for SMAP release will provide insights into Treg killing mechanisms,\naiding Aim 1. Supported lipid bilayers simulating the IS will assess CD2 as an IS signal integrator/amplifier of\nkilling by analyzing dual CAR Tregs. Our central hypotheses are that Tregs reprogrammed in aim 1 for 1C-,\npurine- and glutathione- metabolism have enhanced suppression and SMAP release, triggered by CD2\nintegrated and amplified IS signals and optimal GVHD/GVL.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract We propose to develop nontoxic, tunable off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cell-based\nimmunotherapy to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Murine CD19 CAR CD4 Treg adoptive transfer fully\nprevented graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and eliminated all CD19 lymphoma cells. Surprisingly, the\nmechanism was not CD4 Treg mediated suppression of Teffectors to below that needed for GVHD but above\nthat needed for graft-vs-leukemia (GVL). Instead, these Tregs had dual suppressor and cytolytic functions as\nevidenced by equal killing comparable to Teffectors at a Treg purity level of 99.9%. In vitro and in vivo killing was\nligand dependent. These encouraging data led to testing of human CD19 CAR CD4 Tregs that also killed in a\nligand specific manner. Peripheral blood CAR CD8 induced Tregs (iTregs) were equally potent for target cell\nkilling as CAR CD8 Teffectors. Human CD19 CAR CD4 Treg adoptive transfer alone rescued 50% of mice from\na lethal lymphoma dose. With encouraging results, we pursued human pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that\nproduce CD8 but not CD4 T cells and are highly amenable to multiplex gene editing due to their self-renewing\nproperties. These data lead to Our central hypothesis that gene-edited off-the-shelf CD83 CAR iPSC CD8 iTregs\nwill avoid rejection and exhaustion but retain dual GVHD/GVL function. Edits are designed for site specific\nintegration or disruption, including Foxp3 (completed), circumventing rejection by macrophages (CD47 over-\nexpression) and the adaptive immune system by deleting HLA class Ia/II, and STAT3 to render Tregs resistant\nto Teffector conversion. Embedded in genome editing are key biological questions as to how changes in proteins\naffect the initiation, maturation and function of CD8 iTtregs, providing a great opportunity to study human T cell\ndevelopment and control mechanisms. CAR therapy for AML is challenging due to on-target/off-tumor toxicity.\nWe nominated CD83 as differentially expressed on malignant compared to nonmalignant myeloid cells. A\nnanobody CAR generated from a camelid library has exquisite potency against AML cells. The requirements for\nin vivo persistence and function of CAR CD8 iTregs that correlate with efficacy will be addressed here. While\npersisting CAR T cells may control AML, T cells that undergo tonic or repetitive signaling can become exhausted\nand unable to control disease. CAR T cells must be tuned for a productive immune response but not overly\nvigorous to drive cells into a state of dysfunction manifested by poor effector function, inhibitory receptor\nexpression and altered transcriptomics and epigenetics. Strategies ranging from TCR\u03b1 deletion and reliance on\nCAR signaling to immunotyrosine activation motif deletion to dampen CAR signaling but leave TCR signaling\nintact and to switch CARs turned on/off by stopping a drug dimerizer. Aim 1 hypothesizes that genome modified\noff-the-shelf human iPSCs will generate CD83 CAR CD8 iTregs that resist rejection, augment GVL and control\nGVHD; Aim 2 hypothesizes that gene-edited human iPSC CD83 CAR CD8 iTregs need intermittent TCR or CAR\nsignal persistence without exhaustion to effectively suppress GVHD and kill patient AML blasts",

The University of Minnesota\u2019s Advanced Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (ARDL) has\nbecome a trusted resource for clinical trial testing. Here we emphasize our ability to perform accurate and\nprecise iohexol measurements using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to allow\nfor gold standard measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) determinations in CKiD subjects. This and\nroutine diagnostic testing is instrumental in understanding the relationships of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to\nneurocognitive development, behavior development, social development, and cardiovascular disease risk.\nCKiD investigators previously developed the CKiD under 25 (U25) equation to estimate GFR (eGFR) since\nadult eGFR equations do not perform well in this young demographic. Our specific aims are (Aim 1) to analyze\nspecimens undergoing the CKiD iohexol mGFR protocol for adolescents in the 14-17 years of age via new\nrecruitment to better validate and possibly improve upon the U25 eGFR equation accuracy. We are\napproaching this with the hypothesis that when incorporating a larger pediatric population with mGFR results\ninto the U25 eGFR equation, specifically in the emerging adult population where data is sparse, the accuracy\nof the U25 eGFR equation will be tested, validated, and potentially improved should the U25 equation model\nneed adjustment. Aim 2 involves acquiring mGFR results and specimens from a healthy young adult kidney\ndonor population at M Health Fairview to evaluate the U25 equation. Our hypothesis is since the current U25\nequation was primarily generated from a CKD pediatric population, by evaluating young healthy patients with\nthis equation, the study will examine U25 equation continuity in all patients or it will assist in formulating a new\nmodel that provides a better estimate of GFR in healthy and diseased pediatric populations. Lastly, Aim 3 sets\nout to analyze routine and novel biomarkers to assess clinical interpretation and their relation to eGFR,\ncardiovascular risk, social/behavioral development, and CKD progression. Our hypothesis is that biomarkers\nsuch as creatinine and cystatin C will be input into the U25 equation and the results will allow for following CKD\nprogression. Biomarkers T50 and FGF23 will assist investigators in evaluating cardiovascular health in\nsubjects \u226514 years old with CKD at stages 4-5",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nRecent developments in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), biophysical modeling, and computing have\nimproved the sensitivity of imaging metrics to detect disease-related changes in the central nervous system in\nneurological disorders. This improved sensitivity has paved the way for utilizing these metrics as potential\nbiomarkers of disease, in particular, to measure disease progression over short durations. We hypothesize that\nthe multimodal analysis of MRI biomarkers (microstructure and morphology) from the brain and spine will improve\nsensitivity to detect disease-related changes over durations as short as 3 to 6 months. Our hypothesis is based\non our prior work detecting longitudinal changes in brain microstructure over 6 months in an ALS cohort with\nmodest change in functional measures over that time, and that a multimodal analysis combining brain and spine\nMRI measures can improve disease diagnosis accuracy. In this project, we will establish the scalability, sensitivity\nover shorter durations, and overall clinical trial readiness of these metrics through a two-site study. We also\npropose to improve the sensitivity of imaging metrics by combining multiple complementary measures from the\nbrain and spine in a longitudinal multimodal statistical framework. Additionally, we will demonstrate how these\nimaging metrics correlate with fluid biomarkers and functional progression measures.\nWe will acquire structural (T1 and T2) and diffusion MRI data from 40 participants with ALS and 10 control\nparticipants at two sites: the University of Minnesota (host institution) and the University of Florida. We will scan\nthe brain and cervical spine of participants at baseline and 3 follow-up visits (3, 6 and 12 months). We will\ncomplete a neurological examination, ALSFRS-R, and UMN score at enrollment and obtain longitudinal\nALSFRS-R and plasma neurofilament light (NfL) measurements. We will extract microstructural and\nmorphological information from MRI data using dedicated computational methods and modeling. We will also\napply novel statistical tools to combine those complementary imaging metrics into a multimodal analysis. Finally,\nwe will analyze correlations between NfL, change in ALSFRS-R, and multimodal MRI metrics.\nUpon completion of our project, we anticipate that the enhanced sensitivity of our proposed longitudinal MRI\nbiomarkers will have an impact on ALS treatment by providing novel surrogate markers as potential outcome\nmeasures for clinical trials. The expected increased effect size will also reduce the cohort size needed to conduct\ntrials, thereby increasing their feasibility. Beyond the scope of clinical trials, our multimodal MRI biomarkers will\nserve as an objective measure of upper motor neuron degeneration at the single patient level. Our MRI measures\nwill also be cross validated with fluid biomarkers and will contribute to efforts to stratify ALS patients into clinically\nhomogeneous cohorts.\n1",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nNeonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) afflict upwards\nof 250,000 Americans every year. NRDS affects premature infants due to their underdeveloped lung\u2019s inability\nto produce sufficient functional lung surfactant. Animal replacement surfactant treatment options exist for NRDS,\nalthough concerns over bio-variability, interspecies disease transmittance, and religious questions over porcine\nversus bovine derived surfactants remain. ARDS was seen in ~75% of all admitted COVID-19 ICU patients and\nis currently untreatable leading to a mortality rate of ~40%. ARDS is initiated by lung trauma or disease that\nleads to inflammation, causing an uncharacteristic increase of the surface tension within the lungs, leading to\natelectasis. A deeper understanding of the fundamental structure and limiting behavior of lung surfactant\nmonolayers may be the avenue to suggest new synthetic replacement surfactant treatments that could mitigate\nthe biological concerns in NRDS as well as develop treatment options for patients with ARDS. My group has\npreviously identified that the \u201ccollapse\u201d of a monolayer determines the lower surface tension limit during the\nalveolar area compression accompanying exhalation. The physical and chemical factors that govern collapse\nmay be altered in patients who develop dysfunctional, high surface tension lung surfactant during ARDS.\nMonolayers of healthy lung surfactant phase separate into domains of a semi-crystalline ordered phase and a\ndisordered liquid phase of varied composition. We hypothesize that this phase separation dictates many of\nthe dynamic and rheological properties of the monolayer that influence collapse. However, there is little\ndirect information on the composition of the different domains in multicomponent lung surfactants. I will address\nmonolayer collapse and phase separation in the following two aims. In Aim 1, I will visualize monolayer collapse\nstructures using the 3-D serial sectioning capabilities of the confocal fluorescence microscope to determine how\nmonolayer domains alter collapse behavior and the minimum surface tension. I have also recently found that\ncollapse behavior changes on curved, alveolar-size interfaces compared to the flat surfaces in a Langmuir\ntrough, and I will use confocal imaging to determine the relationship between collapse morphology and interfacial\ncurvature. Aim 2 is to pioneer infrared-coupled atomic force microscopy (AFM-IR) methods to map the lateral\ndistribution of the chemical species and their local ordering in multicomponent lung surfactant monolayers. I will\nuse AFM-IR to examine the hypothesis that cholesterol concentrates at domain boundaries to lower the line\ntension while palmitic acid and hexadecanol promote crystallization of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, increasing\nthe fraction of solid phase in the monolayer. Successful completion of this project will provide a detailed\ndescription of the two-dimensional chemical distribution in laterally phase separated lung surfactant monolayers\nand how this phase separation influences the minimum surface tension at monolayer collapse.",

    "abstract_text": "Because children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are frequently unable to report their pain\nverbally, parents often serve as proxy reporters in interpreting and describing their child's pain. Although there\nis substantial evidence that interactions among biological, psychological, and social factors at the level of both\nthe child and the parent influence children's behavioral pain expression and parents' interpretation of pain\nbehavior in the general population, there has been almost no work investigating the influence of dyadic\nparent-child relationships on pain assessment among children with IDD. The long-term goal of this project is to\nimprove the understanding of dynamic and reciprocal processes influencing how parents rate and respond to\npain in children who have difficulty expressing themselves verbally due to IDD and who may exhibit\nidiosyncratic pain signs. To achieve this end, the short-term goal of this project is to identify the specific parent\nand child factors associated with pain expression among children with IDD and differences in parental pain\nintensity ratings. The project will achieve this objective by recruiting a large sample of parent-child dyads in\nwhich the children are between the ages of 1.5 and 5 years and have been diagnosed with global\ndevelopmental delay (GDD). Dyads will be video recorded during a clinically-indicated blood draw to evaluate\npain expression, parents' pain intensity ratings, and parental behaviors during the pain event. Information on\nparents' overall judgments of their children's pain sensitivity will also be collected. We will collect information on\nthe children's adaptive behavior, communication abilities, and gross motor function, as well as several\nstandardized rating scales to categorize parents' general negative affect and pain-related beliefs and\ncognitions. Completion of the proposed project will lead to improved understanding of how parent-child factors\ninteract to influence parents' judgments of pain among children who cannot self-report.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nTo understand complex neural pathways and networks and their remarkable ability to generate human\nbehaviors, it is critical to precisely map brain connectomics in vivo. We propose to make significant advances in\nsuch brain mapping by founding the Center for Mesoscale Connectomics (CMC). We will first map the mesoscale\nconnections between the frontal and parietal cortices. These connections likely subserve higher-order functions\nsuch as attention, decision-making, prospection, and executive control. One key, underappreciated feature of\ncortical connectivity is its specific variations within a given brain region, further supporting the critical need for\ndescriptions of connectivity at a finer scale. Unfortunately, there has traditionally been a major gap in our pursuit\nof creating a human brain \u201cwiring diagram\u201d at high spatial resolution, especially since the gold standard for\nmesoscale brain connectivity, anatomical tract-tracing, cannot be performed in humans. Moreover, techniques\nthat can be applied to humans, such as diffusion MRI tractography, may not recapitulate anatomical connectivity\nat this scale. Due to this gap, we are lacking an accurate wiring diagram of the human brain that can only\nbe obtained through a multi-modal, cross-species, multi-scale approach. Here, we propose to combine advanced\nanatomical tract-tracing (Aim 1), polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) (Aim 2), and\nultra-high field diffusion tractography (Aim 3) to create such accurate wiring diagrams of human and macaque\nbrains while bridging spatial resolutions and species.\nImportantly, we will computationally bridge species, methods, and spatial scales via state-of-the art registration\nand joint (multimodal) modeling of fiber orientations. Subsequently, the remarkable amount of information\navailable in each dataset will be further enhanced using optimized tractography methods.\nAt the end of the proposed funding period, we expect to have complete maps of the mesoscale organization of\nfronto-parietal connections. We will be poised to apply our multimodal, cross-species methods brain-wide,\nincluding both cortical and subcortical circuits. Importantly, the foundation will be laid for computing noninvasive,\nin vivo, accurate, mesoscale connectivity maps of whole human brains through dMRI tractography, which will\nallow researchers to link brain connectivity with cognition, behavior, and disease.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe overall objective of this proposal is to conduct the first mechanistic clinical trial of pediatric Comprehensive\nBehavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) to identify bio-behavioral predictors and correlates of response and the\nmost potent aspects of CBIT delivery. Chronic tics affect 1-3% of youth in the US and are a disabling\nneuropsychiatric symptom associated with multiple childhood-onset mental disorders. CBIT is the current\nfirst-line, gold-standard treatment for tics and focuses on skills to enhance voluntary tic suppression and\nreduce tic triggers. However, about 50% of youth do not benefit from CBIT. The current study aims to use\nmultimodal measurements to identify predictors of response (for whom does CBIT work?), the therapeutic\nprocesses that activate change (what are the potent aspects of CBIT delivery?), and correlates of response\n(what changes occur in patients whose tics improve?). Study hypotheses, based on the literature and our\npreliminary data, predict that CBIT relies upon, engages, and strengthens connectivity within and between\nfunctional brain networks that support top-down control over motor functions. Youth ages 10-17 years with\nchronic tics (N = 100) will complete a course of 8 outpatient, weekly sessions of CBIT and pre-, post-, and\n3-month follow up assessments. Multimodal assessments will include: 1) neural measures of functional\nconnectivity among the brain's large-scale functional networks using fMRI and EEG during rest and tic\nexpression and suppression, 2) direct-observation behavioral measurement of tics, and 3) psychosocial\nmeasures, including assessments of clinical symptoms and patient-centered outcome measures informed by\npreliminary data and our Patient Advisory Board. CBIT process will be assessed via a novel video-based\nbehavioral coding of CBIT sessions. This project has the potential to directly benefit patients both immediately\nand in the long-term. Results will have a downstream impact on clinical practice by informing individualized\ntreatment planning and efforts to streamline and improve CBIT quality. Results will also have an upstream\nimpact on treatment development by identifying novel neural targets for intervention and strategies for\nimproving CBIT outcomes via refinement or adjunctive procedures.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\n The aim of this proposal is to improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neonatal seizures\naffect 1 in 300 infants. Survivors have high rates (40-60%) of permanent disabilities such as\ncerebral palsy, global developmental delay and epilepsy. There is mounting evidence that\nseizures contribute to brain injury and neurodevelopmental disability; better treatment may\nimprove long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Despite the randomized NEOLEV2 clinical trial\nshowing greater seizure control with phenobarbital (PHB), PHB produced increased acute side\neffects in comparison to standard dose Levetiracetam (LEV). These side effects included\nrespiratory suppression, hypotension, and sedation. Furthermore, there has been concern\nregarding long-term neurocognitive side effects of PHB. This proposed project will refine the\nstandard clinical paradigm for neonatal seizure treatment by demonstrating a stratified approach;\nusing an anti-seizure treatment with a significantly improved effect profile, LEV, targeted at\nreducing mild to moderate seizure burden, reserving PHB with its associated side effects for\nneonates with high seizure burden.\n Research Objectives are to (1) optimize the use of a newer, safer, non-toxic anticonvulsant\nmedication for neonates with seizures and (2) develop technologies that will allow for accurate\nimmediate automated diagnosis of seizures.\n A dose escalation and safety study will be performed to determine the maximum tolerated\ndose of LEV. Infants who continue to have seizures following standard dose LEV will receive either\nhigher dose LEV or the control drug PHB, randomized in a 3:1 allocation ratio. Dose escalation will\nproceed in 3 phases to the maximal loading dose of 150mg/kg. A minimum of 10 subjects will be\nstudied at each dosing level and safety data will determine if dose limiting toxicity has been\ndemonstrated before further dose escalation. The primary endpoint will be the maximum tolerated\ndose. A secondary endpoint will be the additional efficacy of higher doses of LEV compared with\nstandard dose LEV. The pharmacokinetics of high dose LEV in neonates will be studied.\n Facilitating early detection and rapid treatment of neonatal seizures is of equal importance to\ndeveloping better drugs in improving outcomes. The usefulness of current seizure detection\nalgorithms is limited by their low accuracy. Within the proposed study the accuracy of the new and\nimproved Persyst neonatal seizure detection algorithm will be evaluated.",

In the final part, we will proof the feasibility of\nmeasuring human brain metabolism in vivo non-invasively via dynamic 2H-to-1H MRS at 10.5 T and 7 T using\n2H-labled glucose and estimate experimental and physiologic variability. We will compare the performance of\nour novel tool to deuterium metabolic imaging. Successful completion of this project will provide a powerful tool\nfor neuroscience and metabolic research.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nHypertension (HTN) is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Nearly half of HTN\npatients are resistant or nonadherent to lifestyle modification and drug-based therapy, so novel therapies are\ndesperately needed. While HTN is associated with increased global sympathetic nerve activity, renal efferent\nnerves have traditionally been the focus of research since they transmit sympathetic nerve impulses from the\nbrain to regulate blood pressure. However, the kidneys are also innervated by renal afferent (sensory) nerves,\nwhich project to circuits in the brain that modulate sympathetic nerve output and cause HTN. Clinical trials using\ncatheter-based total (efferent and afferent) renal nerve ablation (TRDN) have been shown to effectively lower\narterial pressure in treatment-resistant HTN patients. Despite this intervention\u2019s efficacy, it is unknown if ablation\nof the efferent or afferent renal nerves is more important in lowering arterial pressure. To elucidate the role that\nafferent renal nerves play in HTN, our laboratory developed a novel method of afferent renal nerve ablation\n(ARDN) and found that ARDN was as effective as TRDN in decreasing arterial pressure in the\ndeoxycorticosterone acetate and high salt diet (DOCA-salt) induced HTN rodent model. Clinically, if ARDN can\nlower arterial pressure to the same degree as TRDN, efferent renal nerves could be preserved to maintain blood\npressure and volume in response to hemorrhagic or septic shock. Furthermore, TRDN has shown variable\nefficacy in certain patients, and the lack of biomarkers to predict the arterial pressure response to TRDN is a\nmajor gap in the field. Recent studies from our lab suggest that the presence of specific inflammatory cytokines\nin the urine can identify renal inflammation. These cytokines can overstimulate afferent renal nerves and cause\nincreased global sympathetic nerve output and HTN. I plan on translating our findings from DOCA-salt HTN\nrodents to the DOCA-salt HTN sheep model. The anatomic, physiologic, and hemodynamic properties of HTN\nsheep more closely resemble human pathophysiology and allows for the use of human TRDN catheters.\nTherefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to develop and validate a catheter-based ARDN method using the\nHTN sheep model to address current gaps in the field and move closer to a clinical therapeutic for hypertension.\nOur central hypothesis is that catheter-based ARDN will decrease arterial pressure to the same degree as TRDN,\nand the arterial pressure response to TRDN can be predicted by specific urinary markers of renal inflammation.\nI will test this hypothesis with the following aims: (1) Compare the efficacy of catheter-based ARDN versus TRDN\nin an established model of HTN in sheep. (2) Validate the utility of urinary biomarkers to measure renal\ninflammation associated with HTN to predict the anti-HTN efficacy of TRDN. If successful, the results of the\nproposed studies will provide a translational platform to subsequently move into clinical trials of catheter-based\nARDN in humans. Furthermore, this catheter-based neuromodulation approach can also be applied to other\norgans (liver, spleen) in which chronic inflammation drives other neurogenically based diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest family of signaling receptors in animals, and as such,\nthey represent an important class of therapeutic targets. Following ligand binding and G protein activation at the\nplasma membrane, GPCRs undergo regulated endocytosis and sorting for recycling or degradation. Traditionally,\nstudies of ligand-dependent GPCR signaling have focused on receptor-G protein coupling at the plasma\nmembrane (PM). However, it is now clear that GPCRs can continue to signal from internal membrane locations\nand that the downstream responses elicited from intracellular signaling are distinct from those elicited from PM\nsignaling. While the biochemistry of GPCR activation has been studied in detail, the organization and regulation\nof GPCR signaling in living cells remains an underexplored frontier. The proposed studies will investigate\nfundamental mechanisms underpinning spatiotemporal regulation of GPCR signaling and will provide key\ntraining to enable Dr. Blythe to become an independent leader in this emerging area of molecular and cellular\nphysiology. The mentored phase of this project will be carried out at the University of California, San Francisco\nunder the primary mentorship of Dr. Mark von Zastrow, a leader in the field of GPCR trafficking and signaling.\nThe long-term goals of this work are to understand (1) how the subcellular localization of GPCRs and their\nassociated proteins change in response to signaling and (2) how this cellular reorganization regulates their\ndistinct downstream responses. The first two Aims will focus on receptor trafficking and signaling, defining the\nmechanisms by which unique endocytic (Aim 1) and recycling (Aim 2) pathways sculpt signaling by\nendogenously expressed GPCRs in a HEK293 cell model. In carrying out these experiments, Dr. Blythe will gain\nnew experience in advanced imaging techniques, as well as in integral membrane protein biochemistry with the\nhelp of Dr. Aashish Manglik (collaborator). Aim 3 frames the biology in a broader perspective by asking how the\ndynamic subcellular localization of other proteins contributes to the spatiotemporal regulation of GPCR signaling.\nUsing a novel proximity labeling approach under the mentorship of Dr. Nevan Krogan (co-Mentor) and Dr. Ruth\nH\u00fcttenhain (collaborator), Dr. Blythe will map the changes in the proteomes of specific cellular compartments\nduring the activation of the same model GPCRs and explore how these changes dictate signaling. The proposed\nwork will enable a systems-level analysis of GPCR signaling that was not feasible with current approaches and\nprovide an invaluable training opportunity for Dr. Blythe in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. In summary,\nthis project will take advantage of the expertise of a diverse mentorship team and the world-class resources and\nfacilities at UCSF to tackle fundamental questions in GPCR biology.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCannabis is the most frequently used illicit drug in the United States. Onset of cannabis use usually occurs\nduring adolescence, which represents a vulnerable period in neurobiological development. Due to uncertainty\nsurrounding the long-term consequences of adolescent cannabis exposure, there is mounting concern that\nrelaxing legal restrictions will result in increased adolescent use. Approximately 30% of users develop\ncannabis use disorder (CUD), and nearly half of all regular cannabis users develop cannabis withdrawal\nsyndrome which is marked by negative affective symptoms and craving that may drive relapse. During\nabstinence craving may increase over time or \u201cincubate\u201d resulting in a period of heightened vulnerability to\nrelapse in response to drug-related cues. Withdrawal symptoms during abstinence are clinically significant\nbecause they may impact efforts to reduce cannabis use, promote use of other substances of abuse, and\nadversely influence treatment outcomes. Currently there are no approved pharmacotherapies for CUD. The\nprimary objective of this proposal is to determine how chronic cannabinoid use in adolescence impacts\nglutamatergic transmission and plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the contribution of these\nadaptations to later relapse-like behavior and craving. Our central hypothesis is that cannabinoid self-\nadministration and withdrawal induces changes in glutamate transmission and synaptic connectivity in the NAc\nthat promote negative affective processes and ultimately trigger relapse. To test this hypothesis we will use\nbehavior, whole mount immunohistochemistry and light sheet microscopy, optogenetic aided neurophysiology,\nand chemogenetic manipulation techniques to assess the involvement of pathway specific glutamatergic\nneuroplasticity in cannabis seeking. We will use a model of adolescent intravenous D9-tetrahydrocannabinol\n(THC) self-administration and withdrawal to confirm the presence of an incubation of drug seeking effect at an\nintermediate or protracted withdrawal time point. We will assess somatic and non-somatic symptoms of\nspontaneous withdrawal based on alignment with DSM-5 criteria and the Research Domain Criteria framework.\nUnbiased mapping of whole brain c-Fos immunoreactivity will be used to identify regional neural activation\nassociated with cannabinoid withdrawal and cue-reactivity. We will examine input-specific cannabinoid\nwithdrawal-induced plasticity at glutamatergic synapses in identified D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons in NAc\ncore and shell coupling in vitro slice electrophysiology with optogenetically evoked EPSCs. Finally, we will\nutilize chemogenetic neuromodulation to test the importance of one of these circuits for regulating relapse-like\nbehavior and endophenotypes of withdrawal. These studies will inform our understanding of the mechanisms\nunderlying cannabis withdrawal syndrome, an important and understudied facet of CUD, and how glutamate\ntransmission and synaptic plasticity is altered over the course of withdrawal. This may have important\nimplications for identifying unique therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract_text": "The Neurovascular unit (NVU) comprises of cells in the brain vasculature (endothelial cells and pericytes) working in \ncoordination with parenchymal cells (neurons and astrocytes) to maintain brain homeostasis and cognitive function. \nIntricate functional interactions among NVU cells, referred to as neurovascular coupling, is progressively impaired \nand NVU composition is severely disrupted in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, the underlying pathophysiological \nmechanisms are poorly understood due to paucity of molecular level information on the less abundant, yet \nfunctionally critical, cerebrovascular endothelial cells and pericytes. The fMRI imaging, widely used in the clinic to \nevaluate neurovascular coupling, may not inform molecular level changes. It is challenging to identify changes in \nNVU composition using standard histopathological methods, because they lack sensitivity and specificity to locate \nendothelial cells and pericytes in the brain tissue. Bulk RNA sequencing from postmortem Alzheimer's brain tissue \ncan be used to investigate NVU components, but it measures gene expression averaged across all cells, thus making it \ndifficult to define cell-specific pathways and NVU constituent interactions. Single-cell methods and linear \ndeconvolution techniques are currently employed to analyze bulk RNA sequencing data to determine cell-type-specific gene expression patterns. However, these techniques struggle to capture the molecular signature of low-abundant cells like endothelial and pericytes. The objective of the current study is to develop deep-learning methods \nto accurately predict the composition and transcriptomic signature of NVU cells, and to map interactions among them. \nOur central hypothesis is that data-driven deep-learning models, which have the flexibility to capture underlying \ngene-gene and cell-cell interactions in the brain tissue, will predict the composition and transcriptomic signature of \nNVU cells more effectively than the conventional methods. In Aim 1, we will design NUGENT, a novel deep-learning framework, to identify cell-type composition and predict cell-type-specific gene expression patterns. In Aim \n2, we will validate NUGENT using new scRNA-seq data of NVU constituent cells harvested from Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease transgenic mice (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) and their non-transgenic littermates. Employing the data generated in \nAim 2 and publicly available patient and mouse data on the NUGENT framework, in Aim 3 we will investigate \nmolecular pathways regulating neurovascular coupling in cognitively normal and Alzheimer\u2019s patients. It is highly \nlikely that the proposed studies will help identify molecular determinants of neurovascular dysfunction underlying \nage-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s dementia and facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers and \ntherapeutic targets.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nType-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) sequelae damage the cerebral microvasculature and augment Alzheimer's\npathology by inducing brain insulin resistance characterized by sub-physiological insulin levels and impaired\ninsulin-signaling in the brain. Conversely, soluble amyloid beta (sA\u03b2) peptides that accumulate in the plasma\nand brain during Alzheimer's progression exacerbate the impact of T2DM and aggravate brain insulin\nresistance. A critical need exists to identify how T2DM sequelae and sA\u03b2 exposure inhibit insulin delivery to\nthe brain and intensify brain insulin resistance. The long-term goal is to elucidate cerebrovascular and\nmetabolic contributions to Alzheimer's disease and facilitate the development of novel therapeutic\ninterventions. The overall objective in this application is to determine the combined effects of T2DM sequelae\nand sA\u03b2 on insulin delivery to the brain and to identify the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. The\ncentral hypothesis is that T2DM sequelae and sA\u03b2 peptides perturb insulin signaling/trafficking at the\ncerebrovascular endothelium [referred to as the blood brain barrier (BBB)] and reduce insulin delivery to the\nbrain. It is also hypothesized that these effects are further aggravated by the pathological synergism between\nT2DM sequelae and sA\u03b2. The rationale for the proposed research is that a mechanistic understanding of how\nsA\u03b2 exposure and T2DM sequelae disrupt brain insulin delivery will allow us to develop novel therapeutic\nstrategies to address brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease and T2DM. Guided by preliminary data,\nthe following three specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the effect of T2DM sequelae on insulin\ntrafficking/signaling at the BBB; 2) Determine the effects of sA\u03b2 alone and in conjunction with T2DM sequelae\non insulin trafficking/signaling at the BBB; and 3) Identify insulin trafficking pathways at the BBB, vulnerable\nto sA\u03b2 exposure and impaired insulin signaling. Under the first and second aims, dynamic SPECT/CT imaging\nwill be used to characterize insulin uptake kinetics at the BBB in mouse models that exhibit T2DM and\nAlzheimer's sequelae. Moreover, the dysregulation in insulin signaling at the BBB will be captured by reverse\nphase protein arrays. For the third aim, flow cytometry and TIRF microscopy will be used to determine the\neffects of sA\u03b2 \u00b1 insulin signaling inhibitors on insulin transcytosis in BBB monolayers. The proposed research\nis potentially innovative because it employs dynamic imaging methods coupled with quantitative modeling\ntechniques to capture changes in insulin trafficking kinetics at the BBB in T2DM and Alzheimer's mouse\nmodels. The proposed research is significant because the contribution it is expected to have broad translational\nimportance in repurposing existing drugs to treat brain insulin resistance and in identifying candidate targets\nto discover novel drugs. Upon completion of the work, the new knowledge generated is expected to have an\nimportant positive impact by facilitating the identification of novel therapeutic strategies to combat brain\ninsulin resistance in Alzheimer's patients with T2DM.",

This raises neuroethics concerns related to access and justice,\nand scientific concerns because non-representative samples undermine most key assumptions supporting\ncausal inference in research. Our proposal for Improving Recruitment, Engagement, and Access for Community\nHealth Equity for BRAIN Next-Generation Human Neuroimaging Research and Beyond (REACH for BRAIN) will\ndirectly address these ethical and scientific challenges. REACH for BRAIN will utilize community engagement\nwith Black and Latinx stakeholder networks, to co-create evidence-based solutions and ethical guidance to\nexpand the inclusiveness of participation in NIH BRAIN research and human neuroimaging studies more broadly.\n Aim 1: Utilizing a stakeholder network, Outcome Map, and Theory of Change (ToC) already established in\npilot work, and initially targeting recruitment for research with the BRAIN Initiative supported Connectome 2.0\nproject, community members, neuroscientists, and neuroethics experts will co-develop and implement a\ntargeted, community-led and participant-centered deliverables to increase the participation of underrepresented\nand minoritized (URM) groups in neuroimaging research. Using Community Engagement Studios, REACH for\nBRAIN will facilitate bi-directional learning between community members and the research teams, providing local\nvalue for the community and creating a foundation for neuroimaging researchers to implement the framework,\nand engage and recruit motivated participants from URM communities. Initial implementation of the framework\nwill be by Connectome 2.0 researchers at the Martinos Center, to be followed by evaluation and then expansion\nto additional neuroimaging research projects at MGH and Harvard.\n Aim 2: Given the fraught history of scientific racism and biological essentialism in brain science, Aim 1 efforts\nto create appropriately diverse participation in neuroimaging must be accompanied by guidance on how to\nreliably measure and report on \u201crace,\u201d \u201cethnicity,\u201d \u201cancestry,\u201d and related sociodemographic categories. In Aim\n2 we will convene an interdisciplinary expert Working Group (WG) to create consensus ethical guidance and\nproposed data elements for measuring and reporting demographics in more representative neuroscience\nresearch, and we will create applied tools: a) a decision-aid for researchers for working with race, ethnicity, and\nancestry data in neuroimaging research; (b) an educational tool for community members; and c) a template for\nneuroscience journal editors on publication guidelines for reporting race in neuroimaging studies. Impact and\nDeliverables: We will widely disseminate the project\u2019s tools and guidance via: a dedicated website, co-created\ncommunity events; national public events co-hosted by project partners; roundtables with journal editors;\nconference presentations and academic publications; and formal submission to the NIH CDE Repository.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nTobacco and alcohol are the most commonly used substances of abuse, resulting in heavy personal and public\nhealth costs. The ability to identify risk prior to substance initiation has important potential to inform prevention\nefforts and tailor more effective treatments through precision medicine approaches. Continuing technological\nprogress and reduced costs of genotyping have resulted in very large sample sizes in genetic association\nstudies, findings of which have allowed for the prediction of individual genetic risk, through polygenic risk scores.\nThese results have ignited interest in the use of polygenic scores to inform personalized prevention efforts,\npopulation-level screening, and as statistical controls or genetic instruments within research. The incorporation\nof polygenic scores in clinical and research settings shows promise, however there are several limitations to their\ncurrent use including modest predictive accuracy and limited portability across populations. The proposed\nresearch will leverage a trans-ancestry genome-wide association study of tobacco and alcohol use in 3.4 million\nindividuals, combined with ~2.5 million additional participants with microarray, exome, or whole-genome\nsequencing data to improve polygenic prediction of substance use behaviors and to maximize predictive\naccuracy of such scores across individuals of diverse genetic ancestries. There are two major research aims: 1)\nto pool large cohorts of diverse ancestry genetic studies that include information on common and rare genetic\nvariation, and gene expression, to improve genomic risk prediction for substance use, and 2) evaluate and\ncorrect for the sources of reduced cross-ancestry portability of polygenic scores in order to increase their utility\nwith higher predictive accuracy across all genetic ancestries. To accomplish these research aims and to achieve\nthe goal of an independent research career, this proposal includes new mentored training in 1) advanced and\nfunctional genomics, 2) advanced statistic and population genetics, 3) ethical, legal, and social implications\n(ELSI) of genetic research. This proposal directly aligns with NIDA\u2019s goals to identify the genetic mechanisms\nthat influence substance use and to use this research to address health disparities. The candidate will receive\nextensive mentorship and guidance with a team of leading experts in the fields of addiction, genetics, and\nbioethics. The training and support provided by this award will facilitate the candidate\u2019s long-term career goal as\nan independent research scientist, building on her background in quantitative psychology, drug addiction, and\nbehavioral genetics. The proposed research, coupled with the candidate\u2019s research potential, has the ability to\ngreatly expand the personal, clinical, and research utility of genomic prediction and to refine our understanding\nof the genetic architecture of substance use.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAssociating stimuli in the environment to biologically relevant outcomes, such as reward or threat, is necessary\nto survive and foundational to decision making. Given the prevalence of disordered decision making, there is a\npressing need to understand the basic neurobiological mechanisms of associative learning underlying\ncue-guided motivation and behavior. The Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) is essential to this behavioral process\nthrough its two main neuronal subtypes: dopamine (DA) and GABA. GABA neurons synapse directly onto local\nDA neurons and modulate DA transmission. DA neurons increase activity to cue-reward associations,\nmodulating firing based on the extent to which reward predicted matches reward expected in a phenomenon\nknown as reward prediction error (RPE). GABA neurons also increase activity in reward learning and their\nsignaling contributes to RPE DA dynamics. In contrast, DA neurons are inhibited in aversive contexts while\nGABA neurons increase activity. Given VTA GABA\u2019s role in both appetitive and aversive processing, these\nneurons may be uniquely engaged to integrate valence in decision making. Understanding the role of these\nneurons in multi-valent learning is important, because behavior often takes place in situations of motivational\nconflict, where opposing goals (i.e., consuming food and avoiding threats) occur simultaneously, requiring the\nappetitive and aversive elements to be weighed and integrated to guide choices. This proposal will make\nuse of new tools to target, record, and manipulate VTA DA and GABA neurons, to investigate\ntheir functional connectivity (Aim 1) and their roles in valence integration (Aim 2). First, I will\noptogenetically inhibit GABA neurons while recording the activity of VTA DA neurons through in vivo fiber\nphotometry. These experiments will test the hypothesis that the VTA GABA modulates local DA neurons and\nthis relationship can change with experience. I will also manipulate and record DA and GABA dynamics during\na motivational conflict task in which there are two opposing goals (consuming sucrose and avoiding shock) to\ndissect the roles these populations play in valence integration. These studies will test the hypothesis that VTA\nDA and GABA neurons produce value and salience signals, respectively, that are collectively necessary to\nintegrate valence, for dynamic reward seeking.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY\nCannabis initiation during adolescence confers four-fold greater risk for cannabis use disorder (CUD) than\ninitiation in adulthood and is associated with increased risk for negative psychiatric outcomes. No effective\npharmacologic treatment exists for adolescent cannabis use or CUD, and most adolescents do not achieve\nsustained abstinence with psychosocial interventions. Functional MRI (fMRI) holds promise for identifying new\nintervention targets and/or clarifying mechanisms of existing treatments but has yet to lead to clinical translation.\nNew, large-scale neuroimaging data and complementary patient intervention designs with precision\nneuroimaging can begin to address remaining questions on the cause vs. effect between neural markers and\ncannabis use, the extent to which putative neural markers of cannabis use instead reflect psychiatric, familial,\nand/or social determinants of substance use disorders (SUDs), and whether neural markers normalize with\nabstinence. Through this 4-year K23 award, I will build upon my existing skillset in developmental neuroscience\nand big data neuroimaging with new training in addiction phenotyping in population studies (e.g., Adolescent\nBrain Cognitive Development [ABCD] study) and mentored implementation of complementary precision\nneuroimaging approaches within patient intervention designs for adolescents with CUD. The proposed research\naims will (1) utilize existing ABCD Study data to validate known and identify new functional MRI markers of\ncannabis use initiation and (2) leverage a precision neuroimaging study within a CUD patient intervention design\nto test the modifiability of functional MRI markers of cannabis use during the transition from regular use to\nabstinence. Matched neuroimaging protocols, out-of-sample validation, design approaches to increase reliability,\nand high frequency scanning in the precision neuroimaging study (3 scans over 6 weeks in adolescents with\nCUD randomized to cannabis abstinence (n=24) or cannabis monitoring (n=20), and matched controls (n=20))\nprovide key innovations towards rigor and reproducibility. With these methods, we will test the overarching\nhypothesis that hyperfunction of fronto-striatal reward circuitry is both a trait-level risk-factor and modifiable\nconsequence of adolescent cannabis use. Recognizing the need for both neural and phenotypic specificity, we\nwill compare hypothesis-driven, fronto-striatal circuit markers to data-driven, whole-brain effects and also\nexamine the potential moderating role of psychiatric, environmental, and social determinants of SUD. Through\nthese scientific aims, associated training goals, and guidance from an exceptional multidisciplinary mentorship\nteam, I will gain the necessary skills to address the current methodological issues facing my field and contribute\nto improved translational research on the neurodevelopment of SUDs. Complementary skillsets in large-scale\nneuroimaging and clinically relevant, patient-oriented designs, together with my clinical training, will uniquely\nprepare me for an independent program of research and associated independent funding.\n.",

Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes disease (LCPD) is a developmental\northopaedic disease with uncertainty regarding its pathogenesis or the ideal treatment regimen. Importantly, a\nkey aspect of the pathogenesis is ischemic injury to the growth cartilage in the proximal femur: both the\nepiphyseal growth cartilage, underlying the articular surface, and the growth plate cartilage, within the femoral\nneck. Dysfunction of these growth cartilages can contribute to collapse of the femoral head and to growth arrest\nand leg length discrepancies, respectively. Despite the known role of ischemic injury to cartilage in LCPD, little\nattention has been paid to the contribution of growth cartilage to either recovery or disease progression. To\naddress this critical gap, Dr. Armstrong will use a well-validated piglet model of LCPD to identify differentially\nexpressed genes within the growth cartilage associated with growth disturbances (Aim 1) and the response of\nthe growth plate and epiphyseal cartilage to transphyseal drilling (Aim 2), a treatment that may benefit children\nwith LCPD-induced growth disturbances. The patterns and pathways identified by spatialomics profiling will be\ncorrelated with the histological features and compared to the quantitative MRI features of the epiphyseal\ncartilage, with the potential to identify translational biomarkers of growth cartilage injury. Dr. Armstrong has a\nstrong scientific foundation, including expertise in musculoskeletal pathology, but she requires additional training\nand dedicated time to develop her orthopaedic research program addressing questions of pathogenesis of\npediatric orthopaedic diseases using animal models. During the five-year training period, she will gain knowledge\nin the clinical management of developmental orthopaedic disorders, develop expertise in novel spatialomics\nmethods and analysis, develop a strong knowledge base in cutting-edge musculoskeletal MRI techniques, gain\ncrucial experience in grantwriting, and undergo professional development in diversity, mentoring, teaching, and\nleadership that will benefit her as a tenure-track faculty member with a primarily research-focused appointment.\nThis training will culminate in Dr. Armstrong achieving R01 or equivalent funding. She will be mentored by leading\nexperts in animal models, orthopaedic surgery, musculoskeletal imaging, rheumatology, and pathology, along\nwith didactic training in the analysis of genomic data, hands-on experiences, seminars/workshops, and\nconferences. Dr. Armstrong\u2019s work will be centered on the UMN Veterinary Clinical Sciences department, where\nthree of her four mentors are situated. Dr. Armstrong\u2019s K01 training will fully prepare her to launch an independent\nresearch career focused on improving the health of children affected by pediatric orthopaedic diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nThe majority of Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients have a clinical syndrome of dream enactment that\ntypically develops years before the onset of cognitive impairment. Under normal physiological conditions, rapid\neye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by vivid dream mentation combined with skeletal muscle atonia.\nThis REM paralysis is lost in REM sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD), resulting in patients who trash, punch and\nkick at night. RBD is a common condition affecting 80 million people worldwide and >5% of those older than\n70. The presence of RBD is highly indicative of underlying neurodegeneration as nearly 75% will develop a\nneurodegenerative disorder in 12 years, most commonly DLB or other disorder of alpha-synuclein pathology\nsuch as Parkinson's disease (PD). Among patients with RBD approximately half have developed, or have had\nexacerbated, their dream enactment after starting a serotonergic antidepressant (usually a selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitor-SSRI). This emergence of dream enactment after starting an SSRI, is termed serotonergic\nRBD (5-HT RBD) and was until recently assumed to be caused by a toxic effect on REM sleep circuitry.\nHowever, careful scrutiny of patients with 5-HT RBD reveals neurodegenerative findings suggestive of\nimpending DLB, such as impaired color vision, mild cognitive impairment and subclinical motor deficits. These\ninsights suggest that SSRI antidepressants do not induce RBD but instead unmask RBD in an individual who is\nalready burdened by early alpha-synuclein pathology. However, this has not been proven, and it remains\ncritical to understand whether 5-HT RBD is, as we suspect, an indicator of prodromal Lewy-body type\npathology. This project will test the hypotheses that people with 5-HT RBD have systemic alpha-synuclein\npathology, brainstem lesions in regions that control REM sleep, and prodromal DLB signs. AIM 1 will seek to\ndetect abnormally phosphorylated alpha-synuclein aggregates on skin biopsy in a cohort of people with 5-HT\nRBD and matched controls (taking SSRIs but without RBD). Aim 2 will use ultra-high field MRI at 7T to\nexamine the pontine region of the coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex for evidence of neurodegeneration as well\nas segment and parcellate REM sleep related neuronal structures. Aim 3 will test for prodromal deficits in\nspeech consistent with Lewy body disease. While these Aims are independent we suspect that the severity of\nspeech deficits will correlate with loss of neuromelanin signal on MRI and pathology on skin biopsy. These\nstudies are important because confirming neurodegeneration in 5-HT RBD would be a breakthrough in\nunderstanding the natural history and progression of DLB pathology. Most importantly, by identifying an early\nprodromal syndrome and biomarkers of disease progression, this project will help speed up the development of\ntherapies to impede or prevent the progression of Lewy body pathology.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nLeukemia is the most common childhood cancer and represents approximately one third of all cancer diagnoses\namong children age 0-14. There is strong evidence that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common\ntype of leukemia in children, is initiated in utero. The ETV6/RUNX1 gene fusion, which is considered an early\ninitiating event in the development of ALL, is present at birth in some children who later develop ALL. Children\nborn with these leukemia-specific translocation in blood cells have pre-leukemia, and there is a need to define\nthe epidemiology of pre-leukemia and identify the factors that contribute to pre-leukemia persistence and\nprogression to ALL. We have developed a robust new method for detection of ETV6/RUNX1 pre-leukemia which\nuses newborn blood spots. We propose to use this method to: 1) examine the newborn blood spots of 500\nchildren who later developed leukemia and from 3000 healthy children who did not develop leukemia to identify\nthe determinants of pre-leukemia at birth; 2) estimate the risk of childhood ALL given pre-leukemia at birth; and\n3) evaluate how long pre-leukemia persists in childhood using both newborn blood spots and, from the same\ncohort of children, blood samples collected over time within early childhood. Together, these goals will allow us\nto determine how many children with ALL are born with the leukemia gene fusion; what factors predict pre-\nleukemia at birth; how many children who never develop leukemia are born with the gene fusion; and how long\nthe gene fusion persists in childhood.\nEstablishing the true population prevalence and determinants of ETV6/RUNX1 gene fusion at birth is an essential\nfirst step in reducing the burden of childhood ALL. Further, this project will be the first of its kind to monitor the\npersistence of pre-leukemia in early childhood. The proposal is an exceptional opportunity to understand\nchildhood pre-leukemia, is robust in design using three independent studies, and leverages existing NIH\ninvestment in pediatric epidemiology. Successful completion of the project will foster epidemiologic innovation\nincluding cohort studies of infants at high risk for ALL, allowing us to fill significant gaps in our understanding of\nthe most common childhood cancer. Importantly, the work has the potential to translate into clinical monitoring\nof ALL in high-risk populations.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nDespites improvements in childhood cancer survival in the last several decades, marked racial, ethnic, and\nsocioeconomic disparities in outcomes persist. Compared with non-Hispanic white children, non-Hispanic black\nand Hispanic children experience lower survival from many cancers, including leukemia, the most commonly\ndiagnosed cancer in children. The underlying causes of these survival differences are poorly understood and\nmay vary by cancer type, and both biological and socioeconomic pathways have been proposed. Recent\nevidence has suggested that lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with survival from some childhood\ncancers. The Children's Oncology Group (COG) is an international clinical trial cooperative group of over 200\nhospitals which together treat more than 90% of all children and adolescents diagnosed with childhood cancer\nin the United States and Canada. In 2007 the COG opened the Childhood Cancer Registration Network (CCRN;\nCOG protocol ACCRN07) to create a research registry. A total of over 56,000 childhood cancer cases were\nenrolled on ACCRN07 through the end of enrollment on December 8, 2017. All children and parents enrolled on\nACCRN07 provided address information which was current at the time of diagnosis. We will work with\ninvestigators at the Minnesota Population Center to geocode all ACCRN07 patients with a valid U.S. address,\ncontextualize with socioeconomic status data, and return small-area SES data to COG for dissemination. We\nwill contextualize each geocoded address with Census data at the block level using seven variables from these\ndata we will use factor analysis to derive a five-level SES indicator. We will then examine the influence of SES\non risk of minimum residual disease at the end of induction therapy, relapse, other serious toxicities and\nadverse events, and survival in >9,500 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Over 9,500 ALL\npatients on ACCRN07 with a valid address will also have been treated on COG protocols. Ours will be the first\nstudy to evaluate SES as a predictor of childhood cancer outcomes on a large scale within the Children's\nOncology Group, and will include detailed cytogenetic and molecular characterization of each tumor. Additionally,\nto our knowledge, this will be the first analysis of SES predictors of short-term treatment toxicities. We will create\na highly useful resource on a large scale for a contemporary cohort of childhood cancer patients. Our findings\nwill have translational potential in that outcomes related to SES may indicate the need to develop tailored\ninterventions for low-resource patient populations. Additionally, this cohort's utility will extend beyond outcomes\nof therapy and into survivorship with linkages to the National Death Index (NDI) to obtain mortality data. Our\nlong-term goal is to understand the factors that contribute to disparities in childhood cancer relapse, survival,\nand the burden of morbidity in survivors. Thus, this effort will inform targeted follow-up recommendations and\nrisk-reducing interventions.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nStressful life events in childhood, including physical and sexual abuse, may have detrimental effects on adult health. Physical and sexual abuse is associated with a 40% increase in the risk of adult obesity; childhood abuse is also associated with pre-pregnancy weight though it is unclear whether abuse influences excessive weight gain during pregnancy.  Phthalates, a group of environmental toxins commonly found in plastics and ultra-processed foods, have been associated with gestational weight gain.  Phthalates are known to have obesogenic effects and could act through consumption of a poor diet (e.g., ultra-processed foods), which may also be associated with early-life abuse.  In fact, those who had a history of physical violence in childhood were 44% more likely to have been exposed to ultra-processed foods. In our own previous work, we found that higher ultra-processed food diets were associated with 13.1% higher molar sum concentrations of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites. Despite the evidence that childhood abuse is associated with pre-pregnancy obesity, there have been mixed findings among the few studies that have examined whether childhood abuse is associated with excess gestational weight gain, and no data on whether phthalate levels are a modifying factor in the association.  Therefore, our scientific aims are 1) to determine the association between childhood abuse and gestational weight gain and sequelae (i.e. large-for-gestational age newborns, childhood obesity, and cardiometabolic disorders in childhood); and 2) to assess whether high phthalate level measured during pregnancy shows effect modification in these associations. We hypothesize that phthalate exposure modifies the association so that pregnant women with both a history of childhood abuse and high phthalate exposure, possibly through unwholesome dietary patterns, have the highest risk of gaining too much weight during pregnancy thus conferring a harmful intergenerational effect on her child. Our operational aim will use the exceptional performance of our research team to enroll and retain a total of 780 pregnant women and their offspring into the ECHO Cohort, as well as enrolling their partners into the preconception cohort.  We will employ a novel recruitment methodology that transcends healthcare systems across the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. Upon enrollment into the ECHO Cohort, our study team will coordinate effortless biospecimen collection. This unprecedented collaboration of healthcare systems will leverage our previous success within the ECHO Cohort and provide valuable data to improve the health of American children.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\n The human RNA-binding proteins, PUM1 and PUM2, are essential for mammalian development and their\ndysfunction is linked to multiple human diseases including developmental defects, neurological disorders,\ninfertility, cancers, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These important functions compel our overall objective to\ndiscover how PUM1&2 control the flow of genetic information from gene to mRNA to protein and to identify the\nfull repertoire of genes that they regulate. PUM1&2 bind to thousands of mRNAs in human cells by recognizing\nan RNA sequence called the Pumilio Response Element (PRE). Previous research showed that PUM1&2\npromote degradation of hundreds of these PRE-containing mRNAs by recruiting RNA decay enzymes. It is now\nclear, however, that this mechanism represents only one type of PUM-mediated regulatory outcome. Thousands\nof mRNAs are bound by PUM1&2 but are not degraded. Therefore, it is now necessary to determine how\nPUM1&2 control the fate of all target mRNAs. The resulting data will provide a comprehensive view of their\nregulatory roles in biology and pathogenesis.\n We propose that human PUM1&2 repress many target mRNAs by inhibiting the process of translation.\nThis hypothesis is supported by multiple examples of genes that are repressed by PUM1&2 at the level of protein\nabundance in the absence of mRNA degradation. The mechanism and prevalence of this translational inhibition\nis unknown. In addition, our data indicate that for some genes PUM-mediated translational inhibition can\nsynergize with RNA degradation to regulate gene expression to a larger extent than either process alone.\n RNA molecules form structures that influence their function and fate. While biochemical evidence\nindicates that RNA structure can modulate PUM-PRE interactions, its effect in vivo remains unknown. In fact,\nthere is an overall lack of RNA structural information of mRNAs in human cells that limits our understanding of\nhow that structure influences gene regulation by RNA-binding proteins like PUM1&2.\n The proposed research seeks to determine how PUM1&2 inhibit translation and to identify the\ntranslational regulatory factors that are necessary for PUM1&2 activity. The structure of human mRNAs will be\ndetermined and its effect on PUM-mRNA interactions and regulatory network will be analyzed. By integrating\nthis new data with existing knowledge of which mRNAs are bound and degraded by PUM1&2, we will develop a\ncomprehensive understanding of this key genetic regulatory network. Discovery of the full regulatory network of\nPUM1&2 will provide new insights into how they control gene expression to regulate normal biological processes.\nMoreover, this knowledge will help elucidate how their dysfunction leads to diseases such as neurodegeneration\nand cancer.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract:\nTRIM-NHL proteins (named after their TRIpartite Motif and founding members NCL-1, HT2A, LIN-41) are\nessential for animal development and control of stem cell fate. Their dysfunction causes cancer, infertility, and\nneurological disorders including congenital hydrocephalus. The recent discovery that multiple TRIM-NHL\nproteins bind to mRNAs provided a crucial insight into their molecular functions. The long term goal of this\nresearch is to discover how TRIM-NHL proteins regulate gene expression to control crucial developmental\nprocesses. This proposal focuses on the Drosophila melanogaster TRIM-NHL protein, Brain Tumor (Brat),\nwhich binds to specific mRNAs and functions in neurogenesis, oogenesis, and embryogenesis. In stem cells,\nBrat suppresses stemness and promotes differentiation whereas loss-of-function leads to over-proliferation in\nthe brain and germline. We pursue the central hypothesis that Brat negatively regulates gene expression by\ncausing mRNA degradation and inhibiting translation to control stem cell fate. Our research plan will determine\nthe effect of Brat on translation, mRNA decay, and stem cell fate during neurogenesis and oogenesis. A major\nstrength of our work is that it integrates both molecular regulatory mechanisms of Brat and its biological\nfunctions at the organismal level. First, using quantitative assays that specifically measure Brat activity, we will\ndissect its repressive domains and identify the required pathways and corepressors in cultured cells. Second,\nwe will identify the network of genes that are regulated by Brat. We will map Brat-binding sites across the\ntranscriptome and measure Brat\u02b9s effect on the abundance and translation status of expressed mRNAs. By\nintegrating the resulting data, our data will provide a comprehensive view of the relationship between Brat-RNA\noccupancy, location of functional binding sites, and impact on mRNA stability and translation efficiency. Third,\nwe use precision genome editing to interrogate the roles of RNA-binding and repression domains of the brat\ngene during neurogenesis and oogenesis in Drosophila. We also created tissue specific reporter gene assays\nthat specifically measure Brat\u02b9s repressive activity in stem cells. The results of this research will provide a\nmechanistic understanding of Brat mediated gene regulation and provide a global view of its impact on gene\nexpression. Our results will establish the role of Brat\u2019s mRNA regulatory activities in the control of the stem cell\nproliferation-differentiation axis. Brat serves as an archetype for the TRIM-NHL family, and our discoveries will\nalso broadly enhance the understanding of TRIM-NHL protein functions in development and disease.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nSevere obesity in children is a highly prevalent, serious and chronic disease that directly leads to severe obesity\nin adults and the subsequent enormous social and financial burden on society. Lifestyle therapy is the\ncornerstone of pediatric obesity treatment, but this intervention when used alone is often insufficient for achieving\nclinically significant and durable BMI reduction. Adjunct anti-obesity medications may improve outcomes of this\ndisease, but the pharmacological options used for obesity in children are extremely limited. Thus there is an\nurgency to identify anti-obesity medications for use in the pediatric population, which are safe, effective, easily\nadministered and affordable. Psychostimulants, the second most commonly prescribed class of medications in\nchildren, have a long-standing safety profile and because of their favorable effect on weight, may serve as a\nuseful adjunct to lifestyle therapy for the treatment of severe obesity in this population. Thus, the goal of this pilot\nand feasibility clinical trial is to estimate the treatment effect of a common psychostimulant, lisdexamfetamine,\nfor the treatment of severe obesity in children. Specifically, 44 children ages 6 to <12 years with severe obesity\n(BMI \u2265120% of the 95th percentile) will be randomized, 1:1, to lisdexamfetamine plus lifestyle therapy or placebo\nplus lifestyle therapy for 24 weeks of treatment. The primary outcome of the main aim will be change in BMI,\nand secondary outcomes will include changes in body composition, cardiometabolic health, and quality of life.\nThe second aim will be to identify participant tolerability of the recommended starting dose of lisdexamfetamine\nand the emergence of clinically significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate. Potential mechanisms by\nwhich lisdexamfetamine reduces BMI will also be explored including changes in executive functioning, reward\nprocessing, appetite, resting energy expenditure, and health behaviors (diet, eating behaviors, and physical\nactivity). The results of this pivotal pilot trial will directly inform the conduct of the larger, fully powered, definitive\nstudy, which ultimately, by identifying a safe, effective and scalable treatment, will improve the outcomes of the\nmillions of children affected by this serious, chronic disease.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nFollowing weight loss, the new lower body weight is extremely difficult to maintain. Many studies have now shown\nthis is because individuals who lose a significant amount of body weight typically have an \u201cEnergy Expenditure\nGap\u201d (EEgap) post-weight loss, defined operationally as total energy expenditure (TEE) in the pre-obese state,\nminus TEE in the post-weight loss state, when at the same body weight. Recent studies suggest that the EEgap\nmay be caused in part by compensatory and enduring reductions in basal energy expenditure (BEE) resulting\nfrom increases in activity-induced energy expenditure (AEE). Therefore, someone who has lost significant weight\nhas to consume less and expend more energy to stay weight-stable compared to weight-matched individuals\nwho have never been overweight. Physical activity ranges from a subconscious drive to move (spontaneous\nphysical activity, SPA) to voluntary, structured, goal-oriented and high-intensity physical activity (programmed\nexercise). Increasing EE through physical activity, in combination with caloric restriction is a common therapeutic\napproach for weight loss, but most individuals do not adhere to physical exercise programs or maintain sufficient\nintensity to compensate for reductions in TEE post weight-loss. Our lab is one of few to study CNS regulation of\nSPA and have focused on the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin A (OXA), which plays a central role in promoting\nwakefulness and energy homeostasis. We found that OXA injection and/or orexin neuron activation reverses\nBEE reductions and increases NEAT and TEE in animal models, without compensatory increases in food intake.\nOur collaborator Dr. Zhang is on the forefront of developing new small molecular orexin agonists that activate\nboth orexin 1(OX1R) and orexin 2 (OX2R) receptors, and one such OX agonist upon i.p. administration robustly\nenhances SPA without changing food intake in middle aged mice and 5-mo old obesity prone (OP) rats. In\naddition, chronic (5wk) administration of the agonist reduced adiposity and weight gain in the New Zealand\nObese (NZO) mice, supporting orexin agonists as a potential therapy to prevent weight relapse post weight-loss.\nThe goal of the current project is to test the effects of these orexin agonists in reducing the EEgap, following\nweight-loss in rodent models of obesity, and to understand if the underlying mechanism involves alterations in\nmitochondrial respiration. We will also test the effect of these agonists on sleep/wake patterns for side effects.\nTo do this, we will use indirect calorimetry in conjunction with behavioral analyses and peripheral administration\nof orexin agonist(s), to determine if activation of the orexin system suppresses weight regain. The long-term goal\nof this project is to enable research and development in using orexin as a therapy for obesity, weight regain and\nassociated comorbidities.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nBacterial expression of cell surface-associated adhesin proteins facilitates the formation of biofilms. Dental\nplaque is a polymicrobial biofilm of the human mouth that contributes to oral infectious diseases. Formation of\nthis dental biofilm is initiated by pioneer colonization, whereby Streptococcus species use adhesin proteins to\nattach to the saliva-coated tooth surface. Among the many adhesins expressed by Streptococci, the antigen type\nI/II (AgI/II) adhesin family is widely conserved and has been shown to mediate interactions with several host\nmolecules and other oral microbes. This proposal uses Streptococcus gordonii as a model to investigate the role\nof AgI/II adhesins in host surface attachment and biofilm development. S. gordonii is an oral commensal that\nexpresses two AgI/II adhesins: SspA and SspB (SspA/B). Evidence shows that SspA/B is necessary for\nattachment to salivary mucin 5B (MUC5B)-coated surfaces. Proposed experiments will investigate binding\nbetween SspA/B proteins and MUC5B glycans. The variable (V) regions of SspA and SspB are expected to\ndifferentially bind the O-glycans decorating the MUC5B peptide backbone, contributing to initial attachment.\nSspA/B expression decreases, however, as the biofilm matures, suggesting that transcriptional regulation of\nsspA/B is complex. Data suggests that after initial surface attachment, protein acetylation regulates sspAB\nexpression via the two-component system BfrAB. Therefore, genetic approaches are proposed to investigate\nthe role of protein acetylation in sspA/B gene transcription. Overall, these studies will show that S. gordonii AgI/II\nadhesins mediate binding to MUC5B and are transcriptionally regulated by acetylation of the BfrB sensor kinase.\nFindings may be broadly applicable to streptococcal AgI/II adhesins and may suggest new mechanisms to\ncontrol microbial community development in health and in streptococcal disease.",

The research and training described in this K23\napplication will build on the candidate's existing expertise, adding conceptual and methodological skills needed\nto develop and implement a novel screening approach that will more precisely identify ASD risk in a\ncommunity-based sample. Aim 1 evaluates the extent of sex-based measurement bias in measures shown to\ncapture clinically-relevant variability in early ASD traits in a sample of 3,000 children between 17-25 months\nrecruited from a community research registry. Aim 2 applies computational approaches to model dimensional\nvariability in early ASD symptoms and identify subgroups of risk in the same sample that are hypothesized to\nvary on clinical outcomes at 36 months. Aim 3 takes a dissemination and implementation (D&I) science lens to\nassess parent and provider views on screening practices to identify facilitators and barriers to change via\nqualitative interviews (Pediatrician N=20; Parent N=40).

Greising,\nPhD, an Associate Professor in the School of Kinesiology at the University of Minnesota. As the elderly\npopulation of the United States continues to increase there is an ongoing scientific necessity to understand the\ncauses of neuromuscular dysfunction in old age. Understanding neuromuscular dysfunction requires\nfundamental evaluations of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) the point of contact between a motor neuron and\nskeletal muscle fiber. The NMJ initiates muscle contraction and allows physical movement including the ability\nto breathe across the lifespan. Without innervation, muscle fibers cannot contract, significantly reducing function.\nThe overall objective of this K02 application is to characterize and correct neuromuscular deficiency and low\nplasticity in the skeletal muscle following both aging and injury by evaluating if shared mechanisms of\ndestabilization of the NMJ exist. This proposal will capitalize on two pathologies that have limited regenerative\npotential of skeletal muscle by evaluating the NMJ across the aging trajectory of mid- to old-age and following\nvolumetric muscle loss (VML), which is clinically identified as a chronic and irrecoverable loss of skeletal muscle\ntissue resulting in functional impairments. Both aging and VML injury result in considerable neuromuscular\ndysfunction, and chronic co-morbidities. My central hypothesis is that progressive NMJ destabilization in aged\nand injured skeletal muscle create a hostile cellular environment in the muscle that mitigates plasticity and blunts\nthe effectiveness of interventions. I propose two specific aims to address these hypotheses: 1) To understand\nthe limits of diminished innervation and NMJ destabilization; and 2) To determine what spatial changes occur at\nthe NMJ during progressive destabilization. The results of the proposed studies will define cellular mechanisms\nthat contribute to the finite adaptive and regenerative capacity of the remaining muscle after injury and aging and\nhow this relates to NMJ destabilization. The stated goal of the K02 award is to foster the development of\noutstanding scientists and enable them to expand their potential to make significant contributions to their field of\nresearch. This K02 award will advance and reinvigorate Dr. Greising\u2019s scientific development in aging biology\nby providing protected time to: 1) to build preliminary data and a conceptual framework for a competitive NIA\nR01-level grant proposal, 2) evaluate mechanisms of NMJ dysregulation in aged and injured skeletal muscle,\nand 3) build my education and understanding of omics-based tools to develop collaborations able to ask and\nanswer impactful questions linking the physiology of the NMJ (my expertise) and these novel techniques\n(collaborative expertise).",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nThis K23 career development project will study the neural underpinnings of impulsivity in adolescent suicidal\nbehavior (SB). The candidate will obtain critical skills and experience in adolescent suicidology and impulsivity\nresearch, advanced neurophysiologic and longitudinal methods, and translation of neurophysiologic research\nto interventional studies needed for a career focused on elucidating brain-behavior mechanisms of adolescent\nSB. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in adolescence, and rates of adolescent SB are increasing.\nHowever, its neurobiology remains poorly understood, and treatments specifically targeting SB are lacking. SB\nin adolescents is a critical public health problem that demands urgent attention, particularly with research that\nwill rapidly translate knowledge to clinical applications. Negative urgency, a component of impulsivity, is the\ntendency to act rashly in the context of negative emotion. It has been found to be increased among youth with\nSB and attempts, and has been linked to impaired inhibition of limbic circuitry by the dorsolateral prefrontal\ncortex (DLPFC), yet precise mechanisms are unclear. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) permits\nnoninvasive quantification of DLPFC functions such as cortical inhibition (CI), the process by which cortical\ninterneurons regulate the activity of other circuits. Previous research indicates that adolescents with lifetime SB\nhave reduced CI in the motor cortex that distinguishes them from non-suicidal youth. However, DLPFC CI has\nnot been measured in adolescents with SB, nor is it clear how CI relates to cognitive and emotional systems\nimplicated in SB, such as negative urgency. In order to study CI-related mechanisms of negative urgency in\nthe DLPFC, simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is required. The candidate proposes\na longitudinal study of inhibitory physiology and negative urgency in 40 depressed adolescents with suicidal\nideation (but no SB) and 40 depressed adolescents with SB. The study will utilize TMS-EEG and self-report\nmeasures of negative urgency to test hypotheses that dysregulated CI is associated with negative urgency,\nthat DLPFC CI is deficient in adolescents with SB, and that CI deficits correlate longitudinally with changes in\nnegative urgency and newly emergent SB. The candidate has prior experience with more basic TMS methods;\nhowever, to attain long-term career goals, additional training in EEG analysis, assessment of impulsivity in\nsuicidal adolescents, and longitudinal/neurodevelopmental research methods is necessary. A robust career\ndevelopment plan, with multidisciplinary mentorship and collaboration, will involve intramural and extramural\ncoursework, methodology-specific seminars and training, and a well-defined plan for grant and publication\nbenchmarks.

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nInvestigators at the University of Minnesota have teamed up to engineer novel protein activators of the Notch\nfamily of cell surface receptors, which are master regulators of T-cell differentiation from induced pluripotent\nstem cells. This technology will accelerate the development of engineered T cell therapies for treating cancer as\nwell as a range of diseases including auto-immune disorders, infectious disease, immune-deficiencies, graft vs.\nhost disease, and organ transplant rejection. Existing FDA approved engineered T cells are powerful\ntherapeutics yet major challenges remain, including difficulty in differentiating T cells from precursor cell types\nand difficulty in editing and validating precursor cells prior to differentiation. To overcome these limitations and\nto enable a transformative jump in T cell engineering approaches, the research team is developing reagents that\ntarget and trigger conformational opening of the proteolytic switch NRR domain of Notch1. The Notch NRR\nburies a cryptic protease site that is normally only exposed to its protease physiologically by tugging forces\ngenerated during binding of its ligand on a neighboring cell. The project aims to develop soluble nanobody\nreagents that functionally pry open the domain and remove the requirement for co-culture with Notch ligands\nduring T cell differentiation. In Aim 1 of the project, phage-display protein engineering is used to identify and\noptimize nanobodies that selectively bind structurally distinct states of the Notch1 NRR. In Aim 2, these\nnanobodies are strategically linked together in arrays for creating potent Notch1 activators by inducing\nconformational \u201copening\u201d of the NRR. In Aim 3, iPSC cell lines that report Notch1 signaling and T cell commitment\nwill be developed, characterized, and then used in assays monitoring differentiation of iPSCs into T cells under\ninduction by engineered Notch1 activators. In the final stage of the project, the reporter cell lines will be used in\nbenchmarking experiments comparing the performance of Notch1 activators developed in Aim 1 and 2, to\nindustry standard technologies. The milestones of this project are: (a) generating a tool set of molecules that\nbind selectively to the Notch1 NRR; (b) developing a panel of iPSC reporter systems that monitor commitment\nand differentiation of iPSCs to T cells that have normal physiologic function including cell killing potential; (c)\ncreating potent and selective Notch1 activators that induce iPSCs to differentiate into T cells with a marked\nimprovement in the efficiency differentiation and expansion over current approaches. This will enable\ndevelopment of improved cancer treatments, and improve health disparities by increasing access to treatment\nwith a standardized iPSC-based cell source that can be frozen and banked for multiple doses while significantly\nbringing down cost per product.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT:\nThe recent FDA approval of 7T for clinical imaging of the knee, opens the possibility that this ultrahigh field\nMRI platform will become a more prominent tool in biomedical research and patient management.\nMusculoskeletal (MSK) research and diagnostic imaging have been traditionally performed at magnetic\nfields of 1.5 and 3T. While there is increasing availability of ultrahigh field (UHF) 7T instruments and FDA\napproval of 7T clinical use in the head and knee, only a fraction of the system\u2019s true capability is being\nexploited. First, approval has only been given for operation in a single transmit mode configuration. As\nsuch, clinicians cannot take advantage of the available parallel transmit (pTx) functionality to integrate\nstate-of-the-art solutions for tackling B1+ homogeneity and local SAR management. Even if available, the\nRF coils and optimization routines to use the pTx functionality do not exist. Second, traditional diagnostic\nimaging methods for evaluating the knee do not fully exploit the array of morphologic, compositional, and\nfunctional data available when performing MRI at UHF. Both the traditional and novel imaging approaches\nalike benefit from the increased signal-to-noise ratio at 7T. The increased sensitivity can be exploited to\nprovide higher resolution images that are known to have a real and significant impact on diagnostic\naccuracy in the knee. Furthermore, certain methods are simply too compromised at lower field strengths\nto be obtained as part of routine imaging at 3T and below including techniques like quantitative sodium\nimaging and perfusion as measured through arterial spin labeling. In this proposal we focus on the\nengineering, methodological and protocol developments to realize the full potential of 7T knee imaging\nand provide a critical translational study focusing on the utility of the methods to impact clinical care. This\nwork will be accomplished by completing four specific aims. Aim 1 will focus on the development,\nintegration, and optimization of a pTx RF coil coil using ultrahigh dielectric constant (uHDC) material and\nRF management strategies to provide high-resolution morphological knee imaging methods including zero\necho time imaging. Aim 2 will implement and optimizequantitative compositional and functional methods for\nevaluating the knee joint at 7T including T1rho andarterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion methods. Aim 3\nwill involve the development and optimization of a sodium (23Na) knee coil using uHDC material and\nstrategies for accurate quantification of 23Na concentration in the articular cartilage of the knee. Finally,\nthe translational Aim 4, will involve a pilot study to explore the ability of the developed technologies and\nmethods to impact patientcare. The technical developments in this proposal will advance knee imaging at\n7T and likely accelerate its clinical adoption. The results of the pilot study are expected to have an immediate\nand important impact,by forming the basis of future longitudinal prospective studies evaluating the effects\nof medical treatmentson clinical outcome.",

    "abstract_text": "Project 1 Summary\nVaccination of Rhesus macaques (RMs) with SIV insert-expressing 68-1 Rhesus Cytomegalovirus vectors\n(RhCMV/SIV) elicits an immune response that in 59% of vaccinees can intercept and effectively arrest an early\nspreading primary SIV infection. The vast majority of vaccinated RM that manifest SIV replication arrest go to\ncompletely clear SIV infection, a remarkable outcome with enormous potential clinical significance. This unique\npattern of \u201carrest and clear\u201d efficacy has been linked to major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-E-restricted SIV-\nspecific CD8+ T cell responses and in RMs with MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses, a protection-predictive\ninnate immune transcriptional response to vaccination in whole blood (the whole blood protection-predictive\nsignature or wbPPTS) that includes a central IL-15 signaling component. RhCMV/SIV vaccinated RM destined\nfor arrest and clear efficacy manifest low baseline IL-15 signaling (IL-15 quiescence) and high post vaccination\nIL-15 signaling which persists through to SIV challenge. Since IL-15 is the major cytokine regulator of effector\nmemory T cell physiology, including regulation of effector function, activation thresholds, population\nhomeostasis, and homing behavior, these observations that correlation between the magnitude and persistence\nof IL-15 signaling induction and protection might reflect an IL-15-mediated modulation of the SIV-specific MHC-\nE-restricted CD8+ T cells, but IL-15 is not the only pathway in the wbPPTS and its unclear whether IL-15 or other\ncomponents of the wbPPTS contribute to the tissue-based immune programming that enables vaccine efficacy.\nIn this project, we seek to delineate the origin and tissue correlates of the wbPPTS and its IL-15 dependence in\norder the delineate the fundamental components of vaccine-induced innate immune programming required for\nefficacy. We will achieve this goal by determining 1) the systemic transcriptomic correlates of the RhCMV/SIV\nvaccine-induced wbPPTS in peripheral and mucosal lymphoid tissues and its dependence on IL-15 signaling\n(S.A.1), 2) the specific spatial transcriptomic response to RhCMV/SIV-infected cells in tissues and the direct\ncontribution of vector-infected cells to the local and systemic transcriptomic responses linked to wbPPTS\nprogramming (S.A.2), and 3) the mechanisms underlying the association between IL-15 signaling quiescence\nand generation of the wbPPTS (S.A.3). We expect these data to implicate an underlying immune mechanism for\nRhCMV/SIV vaccine-induced arrest and clear protection, to provide validated tissue-based immune correlates\nfor clinical translation, and, potentially, to lead to vaccine modifications that would increase the efficacy of CMV-\nbased SIV/HIV vaccines.",

The highly\naggressive nature of SCC in RDEB patients warrants further mechanistic study. High mobility group box 1\n(HMGB1) is a serum biomarker of disease severity in RDEB, but its role in tumorigenesis in patients with RDEB\nhas not been thoroughly investigated. HMGB1 is a chromatin-associated protein that functions in the nucleus as\na regulator of DNA replication and repair. In response to inflammatory signals, HMGB1 is secreted from the\nnucleus and functions as a damage associated molecular pattern that stimulates the innate immune response.\nThe central hypothesis of this proposal is that depletion of nuclear HMGB1 in keratinocytes drives carcinogenesis\nin RDEB by promoting inflammation and accelerating genome instability. This hypothesis will be tested through\ntwo specific aims investigating the effects of sequestering HMGB1 in the nucleus. The first aim explores the\nimpact of altered HMGB1 localization on inflammatory response and genomic instability in RDEB keratinocytes.\nThe second aim evaluates the usefulness of small molecule inhibitors of HMGB1 secretion in preventing tumor\nformation using an in vivo mouse model of RDEB. Successful completion of these aims will provide new\ninformation on the biological function of HMGB1 in patients with RDEB SCC.

    "abstract_text": "In Minnesota, American Indian (34.1%) and non-Hispanic Black (33.4%) women are over twice as likely to be\nobese during pregnancy than non-Hispanic White women of whom 16.6% are obese during pregnancy. This\nhigh incidence reflects the causes of maternal obesity such as low socioeconomic status, high crime rate, and\nexcess exposure to air pollution. Maternal obesity has widespread adverse effects on the offspring including\nincreasing their risk of dying from breast cancer. Maternal obesity also permanently disrupts the mutually\nbeneficial interaction between the offspring and offspring\u2019s gut microbiota, causing gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis\nin the offspring is characterized by a reduction in the gut bacteria that produce fecal short-chain fatty acids\n(SCFA). SCFAs play pivotal roles in maintaining healthy immune functions, cellular metabolism, and other critical\nfunctions. These compounds act mostly through their receptors GPR43 and GPR41, which are expressed in\nimmune cells and multiple other cell types. Here, we will test the central hypothesis that the composition of\ncommensal gut microbes in the offspring of obese dams is causally responsible for an offspring\u2019s increased\nsusceptibility to mammary tumorigenesis, an effect that likely also reflects altered immunity. We will test this\ncausal link by performing fecal microbiota transfers (FMTs). The role of GPR43 and GPR41 in mediating the\nimpact of maternal obesity on offspring will be tested using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mice. The potential for\nclinical translation of our findings will be established by supplementing obese pregnant dams with a commercially\navailable probiotic mix of SCFA-producing gut bacteria and dietary fiber that increases SCFA production. Such\na combination has been earlier found to be most effective in reversing loss of critical microbes of healthy gut\nmicrobiota from individuals who have consumed an unhealthy Western diet for multiple generations. We will use\nallografted E0771 and Py230 mammary tumor models and MMTV-PyMT mice developing mammary tumors at\nabout age 3 months. Shotgun metagenome sequencing and mass spectrometry will be applied to study gut\nmicrobiota and their metabolites, respectively. Changes in immune cell infiltration and activity will be measured\nin multiple tissues and compared with the expression of GPR43 and GPR41 in immune cells. Our studies could\nlead to effective and safe prevention strategies against breast cancer and its growth in the daughters of obese\nmothers, and be particularly beneficial for communities suffering from health disparities.",

We have been continuously funded for 14 years. The\nUMN BIRCWH is a three-year competency-based and interdisciplinary team-mentored research career\ndevelopment program for junior faculty, or \u201cScholars\u201d built on the Office of Research on Women\u2019s Health (ORWH)\nstrategic goals. The main objective and vision of the UMN BIRCWH program is to improve the health of all\nwomen across the lifespan and, by extension, to improve the health of their families and communities in\nMinnesota, the nation, and the world. Our short-term objective to achieve the UMN BIRCWH vision is to\nfacilitate the research careers and independence of our Scholars by expanding their research skills, their\nexperience in team science, their research networks and leadership abilities, and increasing their scholarly\nproductivity. We will accomplish this objective by having each Scholar go through our career development\nprogram or \u201cpathway\u201d which includes the following components: (1) an independent research project; (2)\ninterdisciplinary mentoring teams; (3) competency-based core curriculum delivered through seminars, trainings,\nworkshops, and conferences and (4) optional additional networking and training opportunities. Our long-term\nobjectives to achieve the UMN BIRCWH vision, are to:\n 1. Increase scholarly publications and funding on women\u2019s health and sex/gender differences research.\n 2. Increase the number of interdisciplinary research leaders who advance scientific knowledge in women\u2019s\n health across the lifespan and in sex/gender differences in health and disease.\n 3. Foster new cross-disciplinary collaborations within the University and broader community to increase the\n impact of women\u2019s health research.\n 4. Transform the academic environment by increasing the visibility of interdisciplinary women\u2019s health and\n sex/gender differences research.\n 5. Effect the timely translation of women\u2019s health and sex/gender differences research findings to clinical\n practice, public health, and policy.\nOver the last 14 years, our 16 Scholars have successfully published a total of 1,017 (367 first author) manuscripts\nand received 22 NIH grants as PI (total funding $48,239,932). Additionally, 13 alumni (81%) have been promoted\nto associate professor or higher and 10 are in leadership positions. In the current application, we will build on\nthis strong track record of developing successful and highly productive Scholars and add new innovative and\ntimely elements including a focus on: (1) health equity and antiracism; (2) community-engaged scholarship; and\n(3) academic leadership. These innovations, in addition to the strong multiple-PI team, rigorous evaluation plan,\nand highly interdisciplinary mentors will allow for the UMN BIRCWH to continue to set the standard for training\nScholars in women\u2019s health and sex/gender differences that meet and exceed the ORWH strategic goals.",

    "abstract_text": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cardiomyopathy is ubiquitous, deadly, and results from mutations in the\ndystrophin gene. Dystrophin is an essential component of cardiac mechanotransduction (MT) and distributes\nmechanical stress across the sarcolemma. In DMD, the absence of dystrophin results in cardiomyocytes that\nare vulnerable to contraction-induced damage, which accelerates disease progression. Our understanding of\nthe early progression of DMD cardiomyopathy is limited due to models that do not fully recapitulate human\ndisease, thus limiting development of effective therapies. Given the essential role of dystrophin in connecting the\ncontractile apparatus to the extracellular matrix (ECM) for MT, it is critical to augment DMD cardiomyopathy\nmodels to include cell-ECM engagement with applied physiological force to recapitulate early changes at the\norgan level necessary to test novel therapies. The human chambered muscle pump (hChaMP) can do just that.\nThe hChaMP is generated by 3D printing human induced pluripotent stem cells and bio-ink to yield a pump that\ncan be pressurized to impose progressive strain. The long-term goal is to determine mechanisms by which DMD\ncardiomyopathy progresses to develop novel disease specific therapies to prevent cardiomyopathy. The overall\nobjective is to assess the role of altered MT and ECM dynamics in the absence of dystrophin on DMD\ncardiomyopathy disease progression and to test dystrophin gene editing in a DMD hChaMP with volumetric\nloading. The central hypothesis is that the loss of dystrophin leads to increased vulnerability to mechanical stress\nresulting in early altered cardiac MT and ECM dynamics that promote disease progression and that early\ndystrophin replacement will limit contraction-induced injury by restoring MT and ECM homeostasis and thereby\nrescue DMD cardiomyopathy. Our central hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) To evaluate the\nimpact of altered MT on DMD cardiomyopathy disease progression using the hChaMP model system with\nprogressive volumetric loading; 2) To determine the impact of dystrophin restoration with DMD precise gene\nediting on cardiac remodeling mechanisms dictating disease progression in DMD cardiomyopathy. In aim 1, we\nwill generate a DMD hChaMPs to assess the physiologic impact of increased volumetric pressure on the human\nDMD phenotype early and later. In aim 2, we will introduce DMD precise gene editing to restore dystrophin both\nearly and late in DMD hChaMPs with volumetric loading and assess the physiologic and transcriptional changes.\nAt the successful completion of the proposed research, the expected outcomes of our study is the\ncharacterization of early DMD cardiomyopathy progression with loading and the underlying molecular\nmechanisms. The proposed research is innovative as it combines enabling technologies to develop a 3D\npreclinical model of human DMD cardiomyopathy that mimics disease progression and correction with precise\ngene editing. These findings will have a significant impact on human health by increasing our understanding of\ndisease progression and a strong basis for treating and preventing DMD cardiomyopathy.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nA more complete characterization of auditory cortical processing in humans is critical to understanding auditory\nperception and cognition. Without it, developing effective treatment options for various auditory processing\ndeficits, such as those rooted in central auditory processing, may not be possible. Currently, there is a lack of\nconsensus regarding how to define and parcellate even the earliest regions of auditory cortex, including primary\nauditory region A1, highlighting the significant gaps in our overall understanding of sound processing. Traditional\napproaches to defining primary auditory regions in humans include identifying the macroanatomical landmarks\nknown as the Heshl\u2019s gyri (HG) in each hemisphere and using their locations as a rough approximation of A1.\nWhile macroscopic anatomical information, such as the sulcal and gyral patterning in auditory cortex, can provide\na rough estimate of where primary auditory regions are located, it is not sufficiently accurate. This is likely due\nto the high degree of variability in the size, shape, location, and number of HGs found in the auditory cortices of\nhumans. Conversely, attempts to use functional properties\u2014in particular, frequency mapping (tonotopy)\u2014have\nalso been met with limited success, as tonotopic gradients cannot be used to uniquely position the areal\nboundaries of A1. Aim 1 of the proposed research will exploit recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) to non-invasively acquire unprecedentedly high-resolution in vivo human anatomical data at the\nmesoscopic scale (~0.35mm3), revealing biological information that was not previously available via\nneuroimaging. Access to this information will allow us to generate detailed, data-driven parcellations of auditory\ncortices that more closely match the underlying cytoarchitecture. Aim 2 will complement the anatomical\napproaches in Aim 1 by defining A1 in the same set of individuals, using several high-field cortical and sub-\ncortical measures of functional activation derived using both task-based and functional connectivity paradigms.\nThe task-based functional data will be used to construct tuning maps for several key perceptually-relevant\nacoustic features, the parcellation of which will be constrained by the patterns of resting state connectivity\nbetween sub-cortical and cortical regions. Work from both aims, which includes mesoscopic MRI, subcortical\nneuroimaging, computational modeling, and resting state connectivity, will be combined to provide the auditory\nneuroimaging community with a state-of-the-art multimodal structure-function characterization of primary\nauditory cortex in humans. To aid in the standardization of auditory cortex characterizations in future studies,\nthis information will be made publicly available, along with an atlas. The long-term goal is a complete\ncharacterization and parcellation of auditory cortex in humans. The resulting parcellations in normal-hearing\npopulations will serve as a baseline for characterizing and subsequently developing effective treatments for\nauditory processing deficits in hearing-impaired populations.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\n The goal of this project is to enable the clinical translation of systemically delivered Oncolytic Adenoviruses\n(OAds) for combined diagnostic imaging and curative therapy of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a\ndevastating disease without effective therapies. PDAC has no effective screening methods, and its spread and\nmetastases are difficult to assess. This new generation of OAds expressing Sodium-Iodide Symporter (OAd5/3-\nNIS vectors) developed in the Davydova lab, induces uptake of radioactive iodine by pancreatic cancer cells,\nthus facilitating both SPECT/CT imaging and radiotherapy with 131I. We have demonstrated remarkable pre-\nclinical data to support the applicability of the OAd5/3-NIS platform to facilitate radioiodine-based imaging and\ntreatment of PDAC. However, the clinical translation of intravenously administrated OAds has been stalled by\nthe lack of an animal model that allows OAd replication. Murine tissues do not support replication of human\nadenovirus, preventing the use of mice to study biodistribution and off target effects of systemically delivered\nOAds. Moreover, all rodent systems lack Adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) receptors necessary to bind to Ad3-based\nvectors (including our OAd5/3-NIS). The need for reliable animal models is critical. Less than 5% of anti-cancer\ntreatments that are promising in murine models are successful in human clinical trials. Therefore, to address this\nurgent need, we are developing a novel translational swine model of PDAC. Pigs have been attractive as an\nalternative platform for cancer modeling because of their similarity with humans in terms of anatomy, metabolism,\ntumorigenesis, genetics, immunity, and body size. Furthermore, as we have recently reported, unlike rodent and\ncanine models, pigs permit replication of both Adenovirus type 5 and Adenovirus type 3 vectors on the level\nsimilar to that in humans. Validating systemic administration of OAd5/3-NIS in our swine model of pancreatic\ncancer is the next step before clinical trials. In this work, we will 1) Produce a novel transgenic\nKrasG12D/+/TP53R167H/+ swine model of PDAC; 2) Monitor and characterize PDAC tumor development; and 3)\nConduct the preclinical studies to evaluate the potential of intravenously administrated OAd5/3-NIS to facilitate\nboth radioiodine-based imaging and radiotherapy with 131I in swine PDAC models. Completion of this proposal\nwill enable clinical translation of systemically injected OAd5/3-NIS vectors for treatment and diagnostic imaging\nof patients with PDAC, including patients with metastatic cancer. Importantly, these studies will generate\nessential information on biodistribution, clearance, off target effects, and overall therapeutic potential of other\nOAds in a clinically relevant, adenovirus replication permissive, immunocompetent model. In addition, our novel\npig model will overcome many of the disadvantages inherent in rodents, particularly with respect to size, genetics,\ncancer biology, metabolism, and immunity leading to translation of safer, more effective cancer treatments for\npatients with PDAC, a dismal disease with no effective treatments available.\n1",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY: Given the substantial adverse health and economic consequences of diabetes,\npreventing progression of prediabetes (prevalence of 38% in U.S. adults) to type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major\npublic health goal. The environment plays a critical role in determining risk for T2D. Urbanization has been\nassociated with increased psychosocial stress and adverse health outcomes. Stress responses cause hormonal\nchanges that lead to insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and obesity. Increased\nexposure to air pollution has been associated with higher risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\u2018Greenspace\u2019 is defined as publicly accessible areas with predominant naturalistic elements (e.g., trees, grass,\nwater features, etc.). Previous studies in adults support the hypothesis that exposure to Greenspace (\u2018Green\u2019)\nmay have several health benefits relative to urban built (\u2018Gray\u2019) environments. These benefits may include better\nautonomic functioning as assessed by improved heart rate variability (HRV), reductions in anxiety/stress, and\nenhanced psychological restoration, with Greenspace also serving to buffer air pollution. Walking is the most\ncommon form of moderate-intensity physical activity and has a beneficial influence on blood glucose control.\nPreliminary studies have suggested walking and exposure to Greenspace may act together to improve health\noutcomes. Yet, aside from our preliminary studies, rigorous experimental studies have not been conducted to\nexamine how regular walking may interact with exposure to urban Greenspace, compared to urban Grayspace,\nto improve health. These studies are needed to investigate novel and highly generalizable strategies for \u201cGreen\nexercise\u201d, capable of being implemented at the population-level to reduce the burden of disease. Therefore, we\nwill conduct a mechanistic randomized crossover trial to compare differences in physiological, psychological, air\npollution, and cardiometabolic risk measures between walking interventions completed in urban Green and Gray\nenvironments in adults with prediabetes. This multisite trial will include 180 individuals within metropolitan areas\nof Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN and Chicago, IL. Walking interventions will be completed in urban Green and urban\nGray environments, with participants engaging in 150 minutes/week of walking for 6 weeks in each environment,\nseparated by a 5-week washout. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Measure and compare psychosocial stress between\nGreen and Gray walking. Aim 2: Measure and compare physiological stress over six weeks between Green and\nGray walking. Aim 3: Measure real-time individual exposure to ambient particulate matter using personal air\npollution monitors with GPS tracking while walking in Green and Gray environments. Aim 4: Measure individual\ncardiometabolic disease risk scores (index of blood glucose, insulin, lipids, systolic blood pressure, and waist)\nand inflammatory factors before and after 6 weeks of Green and Gray walking. Aim 5 (exploratory): Examine\nwhether physiological, psychological, and air pollution measures mediate the differential impact of Green vs.\nGray walking on cardiometabolic risk and inflammation using regression-based mediation models.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nMuch progress has been achieved in building computational models that describe how visual stimuli are encoded\nand transformed across the hierarchy of visual areas in the primate brain. However, relatively little attention has\nbeen given to the active component of visual processing, whereby the observer\u2019s engagement in a cognitive or\nperceptual task can exert substantial influence on stimulus-evoked activity. The long-term goal of the proposed\nresearch is to develop models that account for not only stimulus-driven but also task-driven effects in the visual\nsystem. To achieve this goal, we invest effort in improving analysis methodology and in generating large high-\nquality experimental datasets. In Aim 1, we develop and optimize methods that provide robust fMRI\nmeasurements at the level of single trials. This includes a method that exploits temporal dynamics to isolate\nBOLD signals that are more closely related to local neural activity, and an algorithm that improves signal-to-\nnoise ratio in general linear modeling of fMRI data. In Aim 2, we acquire and prepare a high-field (7T) fMRI\ndataset in which a large variety of tasks are performed on a common set of visual stimuli. This dataset exploits\ndeep sampling of a small number of subjects, and will generate a rich, reusable resource for the fields of cognitive\nand computational neuroscience. In Aim 3, we exploit the dataset to test an extant model of how top-down\ninfluences from the intraparietal sulcus modulate responses in ventral visual cortex and to assess how top-down\nsignals from frontal cortex modulate the fidelity of working memory stimulus encoding in visual cortex. Overall,\nthis multidisciplinary proposal will deliver reusable methods and data resources, and will push computational\nmodeling from the domain of stimulus representation into better understanding how the visual system mediates\nreal-world visual perception and task engagement. Advancing our understanding of the computational\nmechanisms underlying visual processing in healthy individuals is a critical step for unraveling the nature of\nsensory disorders such as prosopagnosia and dyslexia.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe global virome is incredibly diverse and emerging viruses threaten global health. Unfortunately, few infection\nmodels can recapitulate natural transmission and evolution. Here we propose to bridge natural and experimental\nsystems to study real-time transmission dynamics within and between hosts and infer virus-pathogen\nrelationships. To accomplish this we will leverage a model whereby the natural rodent pathogens from pet store\nmice are exposed to laboratory mice, rats, hamsters, or deer mice. This model offers a platform for studying\nacute transmission of viruses between and within hosts via natural mechanisms. One major advantage of this\nmodel is that you can access the entire transmission chain from the reservoir tissue, to what is shed, to what\neither succeeds or fails to replicate in the new host. Aim 1 of this proposal will test the hypothesis that the duration\nof exposure, interferon and stage of infection in the reservoir shape virus transmission and evolution. In this aim\nwe will address fecal oral and respiratory transmission. Aim 2 of this proposal will test the hypothesis that\nevolutionary distance and interferon determine the success of cross-species transmission events. To address\nthis we will use wt and STAT2 deficient rats, hamsters, and deer mice. Importantly, this proposal will generate\nSTAT2 deficient rats. Currently, there are no innate immune deficient rats exists and this proposal will provide\nan invaluable tool for the field. We will measure the capacity of natural mouse viruses to cross the species barrier\nand determine the impact of evolutionary distance and innate antiviral responses. Overall, this proposal will\ndevelop and exploit a model system allows for the analysis of transmission of natural rodent viruses to\ncharacterize biological barriers to zoonosis.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\n Medical practice is continuously evolving, with substantial resources allocated to developing medical\ninnovations and enhancing clinical evidence on new and existing treatments. In most cases, new evidence\nsupporting approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demonstrates efficacy of new treatments; after\napproval, new evidence for existing treatments may show them to be ineffective or unsafe. Understanding\nwhether and how new clinical evidence is integrated into practice is critical from the perspectives of a)\nimproving patient safety and health outcomes; b) addressing racial and socioeconomic equity in access and\nuse; c) designing programs and policies to encourage use of high value, effective treatments and abandon less\neffective and harmful treatments; d) containing health care costs by allocating limited health care budgets to\ntheir most effective use.\n The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to study the diffusion of evidence into practice by\nobserving adoption and de-adoption behavior of physicians in response to rapidly changing information about\npotential treatments and risks of continued use of common drugs in the context of COVID-19. This proposal\nbuilds on our prior work on de-adoption of harmful or ineffective medical practices by introducing additional\nfactors that could be associated with the rates and timing of adoption and de-adoption of pharmaceutical\ntreatments. We will examine prescription fills and claims-based use of a targeted set of drugs related to\nCOVID-19 using data from Medicare claims for Fee-for-Service (FFS) enrollees. COVID-19 has particularly\naffected older adults and the disabled and chronically ill, many of whom face increased risk of severe morbidity\nand mortality from the disease, and potentially from lack of access to medical care during the pandemic. We\nwill investigate how prescribing of COVID-19-related drugs responds to state-level drug policies, FDA safety\ncommunications, and COVID-19 pressures on the healthcare system. We will assess how patient\ncharacteristics (e.g., race and ethnicity, age, and key comorbidities), as well as physician and medical practice\norganization characteristics are associated with these prescribing patterns.\n Three in-depth COVID-19 case studies will assess uptake and de-adoption of treatments associated with\nlower quality evidence and more rapid turnaround in a context where public attention is closely attuned to\nevery development and pre-print biomedical manuscripts are discussed at length in the popular press.\nExploring adoption and de-adoption of treatments in a context of high uncertainty and high burden and\nprevalence of disease will provide important insights into the role of information quality in physician decision\nmaking. In addition, these cases will allow us to explore the effectiveness of state-level regulation of\ntreatments. In particular, hydroxychloroquine was regulated in some states in response to fears that not\nenough would be available for people using the drug to treat non-COVID-19 conditions.",

    "abstract_text": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is the most common\nliver disease in the United States and it increases the risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Prior\nresearch shows that dysregulated lipid partitioning in liver mitochondrial oxidative metabolism pathways [i.e.,\ntricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and ketogenesis] is fundamental to liver\nsteatosis and oxidative stress that underlie NAFLD. A traditional view of mitochondrial lipid partitioning is that\nlipids are fated to ketogenesis when the capacity of terminal oxidation (TCA cycle and OXPHOS) is exceeded,\nbut ketogenesis is limited when the TCA cycle and OXPHOS can support terminal oxidation or under states of\nhigh hepatic energy demand. However, this dualist view of lipid partitioning fails to describe heterogeneity in\nmitochondrial function across the NAFLD spectrum and reveals knowledge gaps in our understanding of how\nliver mitochondria may coordinate lipid catabolism. The objective of this project is to test the innovate premise\nthat ketogenesis actively supports TCA cycle function and that loss of this salutary coupling contributes to\nNAFLD. This is based on our preliminary data from mouse models of varying NAFLD severity. Initial studies\nused phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT)-null mice that exhibit NASH owing to reduced\nphosphatidylcholine, which is characteristic of human NASH. PEMT-null mice showed lower liver NAD+ and\nmolecular indices of terminal oxidation, however, in vivo TCA cycle flux was unaltered and ketogenesis was\nincreased. This phenotype in mice mimics our preliminary data in humans with NASH which showed elevated\nketogenesis and preserved TCA cycle flux. Notably, PEMT-null mice fed a high-fat diet and wild type mice fed\na ketogenic diet had lower liver nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), which may lead to greater NAD+\nsalvage to facilitate TCA cycle flux that would otherwise be impaired. In addition, knockdown of ketogenic\nenzyme 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2) in mice on a high-fat diet resulted in lower liver\nketogenesis (as expected) and NAD+. Our central hypothesis is that ketogenesis enhances TCA cycle flux via\nacute and chronic NAD+ provision under conditions of excess lipid availability. This hypothesis will be tested\nvia two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will demonstrate that a ketone body-NNMT-NAD+ axis mitigates liver steatosis by\npromoting TCA cycle flux in NASH. Mice lacking liver HMGCS2 will receive a Gubra Amylin NASH (GAN) diet\nand will be independently crossed with liver-specific NNMT knockout mice or provided nicotinamide riboside to\nincrease NAD+. Aim 2 will determine that an increased NAD+/NADH ratio supported by ketogenesis facilitates\nlipid disposal in response to exercise. HMGCS2 and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 will be deleted in\nlivers of mice fed a GAN diet to impede ketogenesis and NAD+ provision. Acute and chronic exercise protocols\nwill be completed. Impact: This project will lead progress in creating a paradigm shift by advancing our\nunderstanding of how ketogenesis facilitates lipid disposal and informing new therapies for preventing NASH.",

    "abstract_text": "How cells become specified and differentiate at the correct time and place is a fundamental question in\ndevelopmental biology. Cranial neural crest cells (cNCCs) are an excellent model system to understand this\nprocess due to the multipotent nature of the progenitor cells, generally unrestricted developmental potential\nwith known lineage and derivatives, and defined gene regulatory networks. In addition to the gene networks,\nepigenetic regulators can affect the expression of numerous target genes and may help to explain the\ndifferences in penetrance and phenotype between individuals with the same genotype. This is important since\ndefects in neural crest development underlie many human congenital birth defects, such as cleft lip with or\nwithout palate and many craniofacial syndromes. Thus, understanding the genetic and epigenetic regulators in\ncNCC development is key to understanding how cell fate is determined. We hypothesize that PRDM\nparalogs regulate global gene expression by regulating downstream targets oppositely, including Wnt\npathway components, to control the timing of cartilage/bone differentiation within the cNCC lineage.\nThe rationale for the proposed studies is that an in depth understanding of normal cNCC development will\nprovide insights into normal biology and the etiology of neural crest-associated birth defects, many of which are\nthought to arise from cNCC abnormalities. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims: 1) Test\nthe hypothesis that PRDM proteins act upstream of Wnt signaling to control the timing of cNCC\ndifferentiation into chondrocytes. We will test the hypothesis PROM paralog activity is required in cNCCs\ncell autonomously upstream of Wnt signaling to promote differentiation of chondrocytes. 2) Test the\nhypothesis that Prdm3 and Prdm16 genetically interact to regulate cNCC gene expression and\nchromatin accessibility. In Aim 2, hypothesis that Prdm3 and Prdm16 genetically interact to control gene\nexpression via regulating transcription and chromatin modification specifically at cNCC and Wnt gene targets.\n3) Test the hypothesis that Prdm3 regulates global gene expression by controlling the timing of\ngenomic accessibility of Prdm16. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that loss of Prdm3 leads to global\nalterations in chromatin state at cNCC progenitor genes via changes in binding of Prdm16 throughout the\ngenome, which controls the liming of cNCC differentiation into chondrocytes. Together, these studies will\nreveal basic information of how cNCCs differentiate into specific cell types during development. The results of\nthis proposal have the potential to reveal important new insights into cNCC development and how these\nprocesses go wrong in disease, with the hope of providing a foundation for the design of therapeutic strategies\nfor neural crest associated birth defects.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nAlzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is an overwhelming medical condition at any age, but\nADRD in younger adulthood is particularly devastating, affecting quality of life and independence of individuals\nin their prime years. Early onset ADRD (EOD) is defined as an ADRD diagnosis before age 65. While it is\ncommonly perceived that EOD occurs primarily as a rare genetic syndrome, the known genetic variants account\nfor less than 5% of cases. Despite the distressing course and unclear nature of the disease in the majority of\ncases, EOD is widely understudied. Current data on the prevalence and incidence of EOD seem to\nunderestimate the magnitude of the problem and there is no information available regarding predisposing and/or\nprotective factors for EOD.\nUsing the infrastructure of an international Dementia Risk Pooling Project (DRPP), we propose a prospective\nstudy of EOD development which comprises individuals from five large multi-ethnic population-based cohort\nstudies (ARIC, MESA, FHS, Whitehall II and, UK Biobank). This study provides the opportunity to (1) refine\nestimates of incident EOD, (2) investigate the role of cardiovascular, lifestyle and behavioral risk factors in the\nonset of EOD and (3) study whether a favorable midlife risk profile in the presence of genetic predisposition\ndelays EOD age of onset. This evaluation will be the first study to pool multiple international population-based\ncohorts to prospectively study ADRD before the age of 65 in young and middle-aged adults. The current notion\nthat EOD is merely driven by genetic syndromes has shadowed efforts to identify distinct predisposing and/or\nprotective factors for EOD and targeting vulnerable populations for early detection and prevention. The findings\nwill shed much needed light on the vulnerability and unique risk factors for EOD and may lead to development\nof more effective targets for prevention to delay onset and progression of disease. EOD is relatively rare and\nthus primordial and primary prevention may be more efficient than screening and secondary or tertiary\nprevention. Our data on EOD risk factors will strengthen targeted intervention strategies with focus on primordial\nand primary prevention.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCellular energy metabolism is a fundamental process of life that produces biochemical energy in the form of\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) to support neuronal activity and brain function. Glucose and oxygen are the\nmain energy substrates of the brain and are metabolized through glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and\noxidative phosphorylation pathways, constituting a neuroenergetic network that effectively regulates ATP\nproduction and homeostasis. ATP production and homeostasis are affected when brain states change, as\nsigns of altered cerebral glucose and oxidative metabolism are commonly seen in aging, neurodegenerative\ndiseases, psychiatric disorders, stroke and cancer. Despite the important roles of brain energy metabolism,\nmetabolic alteration and reprogramming in health and disease, noninvasive neuroimaging tools capable of\nmapping and quantifying key features of neuroenergetic network in the human brain are still lacking.\nOver the past two decades, we have developed three ultrahigh-field (UHF) metabolic imaging techniques\nbased on deuterium-2 (2H), oxygen-17 (17O), and phosphorus-31 (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy\n(MRSI) imaging capable of noninvasive and quantitative assessment of brain energy metabolism along major\nmetabolic pathways. However, X-nuclear MRSI-based methods face severe challenges in translational\napplications due to low detection sensitivity and metabolite content, and prolonged scanning time.\nThis project aims to develop and integrate multiple cutting-edge technologies to build next generation high-\nresolution, high-performance and translatable neuroimaging tools on an FDA-approved 7 Tesla clinical scanner\nfor quantitatively imaging key metabolic rates and other essential neurophysiological parameters related to\nenergy metabolism in healthy and diseased human brains. Three pilot studies are proposed to test and\ndemonstrate the utility and feasibility of the novel neuro-metabolic imaging tools to quantitatively study\nneuroenergetics and metabolic reprogramming in brain activation, aging processes and brain tumors, aiming to\nunderstand their critical roles in brain function and disease. This project leverages the interdisciplinary\nexpertise of an outstanding team leading in the research field, excellent imaging facilities and resources, and\nclose collaboration among team members. The advanced neuroimaging tools established by this project is\nexpected to have significant impact on changing the paradigm of neurometabolic imaging and energy\nmetabolism research, and enable translational studies of human brain bioenergetics and metabolic\nreprogramming under physiopathological conditions.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of human cancers with very high fatality rate and short\nsurvival time, and the cancer cells aggressively infiltrate the brain and are intrinsically resistant to\nchemotherapy and radiation therapy. Intra-tumoral heterogeneity is a major challenge in therapeutic\ndevelopment for GBM patients because surgical acquisition of clinical specimens cannot be used to monitor\nthe tumor progression and/or the underlying metabolic changes. Various neuroimaging methods have been\nused to study the morphology of the brain tumors. However, the need for noninvasively characterizing the brain\ntumors and their metabolic features has not been met, which should be critical for prognosis or for monitoring\nthe tumor progression and response to treatment. It is well known that a common hallmark of the cancer cells\nis disrupted glucose metabolism, in which upregulated glycolysis is accompanied by inhibited mitochondrial\noxidation, i.e., the \u201cWarburg effect\u201d. Imaging the \u201cWarburg effect\u201d and its spatial variability in brain tumors is a\nnew attempt that can have a major impact on cancer research, particularly in the treatment of GBM, because\ntherapies aimed at reversing the Warburg effect have shown promise in GBM ; however, great efforts are\nneeded to develop novel metabolic imaging techniques to achieve the capabilities sought by clinicians.\n We have recently initiated a project aiming to develop a neuroimaging technique based on deuterium (2H)\nMRS (DMRS) detection of 2H-labeled brain metabolites following an administration of D-Glucose-6,6-d2 (d66).\nOur preliminary results indicate that the dynamic DMRS imaging can determine the cerebral metabolic rates of\nglucose (CMRGlc) and TCA cycle (VTCA), thus, the lactate production rate (CMRLac) in addition to the\nconcentrations of deuterium-labeled glucose (Glc), mixed glutamate/glutamine (Glx) and lactate (Lac) in living\nbrains. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that the uncoupling between the glycolysis and\noxidation in brain tumor can be quantitatively imaged via mapping the [Lac]/[Glx] ratio defined as an index of\nWarburg effect (IWE); and it has been shown that IWE is highly sensitive for distinguishing brain tumor from\nsurrounding normal tissues. In this application, we are seeking NIH funding support to move forward with the\nDMRS imaging development through: i) integrated hardware and software development and the ultrahigh field\nMR technology to further boost signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spectral resolution and spatiotemporal resolution; ii)\ntesting the ultrahigh resolution DMRS imaging in healthy subject, and tumor patients and establishing a\nquantification model and imaging processing pipeline for future application; and iii) comparing the DMRS\nimaging results with the neuropathological and immunohistochemical findings of the biospecimens to\nunderstand the correlation between the DMRSI measurements and biological features of brain tumor. Our\ninterdisciplinary research team with unique expertise is ready for a full-scale development of this highly\ninnovative and cost-effective neuroimaging essential for basic research and clinic application in neuro-oncology.",

    "abstract_text": "Existing neurotechnologies continue to make significant clinical impact, but challenges remain for scientists and engineers in moving new devices from the bench to the bedside. Over the past two years (through an R25 grant), we developed a comprehensive, freely-available online short course on neurotechnology translation and commercialization called the NeuroTech Course featuring 20 self-paced video lectures from a diverse and experienced group of program faculty, topical questions, and a growing catalog of online resources for more advanced learning. These short-course video lectures cover preclinical model systems, safety and efficacy studies, good laboratory practices, device testing, quality system processes, regulatory agency interactions, steps in developing an investigational device exemption (IDE) application, reimbursement agency interactions, clinical trial design with an emphasis on quantitative outcome measures of target engagement, bioethical considerations that are specific to neural medical devices, techniques for securing strong intellectual property claims, funding opportunities available for technology development and clinical trials, and advice on moving neurotechnology into successful commercial ventures. With this grant, we propose to significantly amplify this course by (1) creating virtual \u201csprints\u201d in which program faculty guide participant cohorts through the online lectures (to maximize adherence to the curriculum and enable participants to ask follow-up questions along the way). These online \u201csprints\u201d will then be coupled with a (2) 3-day hands-on workshop (in person and virtual options) in which participants will work with program faculty to review case studies; discuss best practices through a series of intensive exercises taking a clinical need through the innovation process; and be mentored through the development of their own plans. The course will target senior postdoc scholars; academic and clinical faculty; and start-up company scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs who are preparing to develop research grant proposals with a clinical component. This course will serve as an important bridge for early-stage entrepreneurs to be successful in moving to later-stage programs, including NIH C3i, NSF I-Corps, incubators, and accelerators.",

Abnormal activity patterns within these pallidofugal output nuclei has been hypothesized to contribute to\nseveral cognitive-motor signs of Parkinson's disease (PD), including levodopa-resistant gait dysfunction,\nbehavioral set shifting difficulties, and deficits in goal-oriented motivation, respectively. However, little is known\nabout the actual pathophysiological changes that occur in these nuclei with the emergence of Parkinson's\ndisease. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting regions in and around the GPi and subthalamic nucleus (STN)\ncan be highly effective for treating motor signs of PD, but how such targeting affects MLR, CM/Pf, and LHb\nnuclei and how those effects relate to improvement or worsening of cognitive-motor signs of PD is not well\nunderstood. In the preclinical MPTP-treated non-human primate model of PD, Project 3 will investigate the\ncontribution of (1) the GPi \u2194 MLR network to parkinsonian gait dysfunction, (2) the GPi \u2192 CM/Pf network to\ndifficulties with behavioral set shifting, and (3) the GPi \u2192 LHb network to deficits in goal-oriented motivation.\nThis project will leverage our capacity to perform wireless spike and LFP recordings from chronic microdrives\nduring untethered movement and during cognitive-motor tasks relevant to PD. The project will also develop a\nnovel response surface optimization algorithm that uses real-time feature assessments of spike and LFP\nresponses in the MLR, CM/Pf, and LHb to drive DBS targeting of the STN/lenticular fasciculus or GPe/GPi.\nThe settings within the multi-dimensional DBS parameter space that generate the most robust changes in\nspike rate, spike pattern, spectral power, and/or information encoding within the MLR, CM/Pf, and LHb will be\ntested in cognitive-motor behavioral tasks that introduce obstacles and vary levels of effort and reward.

There is a strong clinical\nneed to better understand these processes and in turn harness them to deliver therapy that is tailored to a\npatient's own symptomatology and motor control needs on a moment by moment basis. This project will\ninvestigate how spatiotemporal optimization of DBS settings can differentially affect neural pathway activation\nthrough the brain's motor control network and how those results translate to improving each of the four cardinal\nmotor signs of PD (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability). Aim 1 will investigate at the single\ncell, ensemble, and network levels how spatiotemporal parameters of DBS influence information transmission,\nand critically how the motor control network is able to produce naturalistic movements despite information\nlesions induced by high-frequency stimulation. Aim 2 will develop and apply a Bayesian Dual Adaptive Control\nalgorithm to investigate how spatiotemporal DBS settings affect electrically-evoked compound action potentials\nand how those features map onto modulating individual motor signs. Aim 3 will leverage the ground-truth\nelectrophysiological data from high-density microelectrode array recordings at the site of DBS and within the\nmotor control network to validate key parameters used in computational models of neural pathway activation\nwith DBS therapy. The proposed study integrates innovative high-density microelectrode array recordings,\nclosed-loop optimization algorithms, micron-resolution anatomical pathway imaging, and subject-specific\ncomputational models of DBS. Together, this project will enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of\nPD and provide critical data towards translating next generation personalized and responsive DBS therapies.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nPrenatal alcohol use (PAU) is associated with increased likelihood of obstetric complications, including preterm\nlabor, miscarriage, and stillbirth, and is also the direct cause of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, a collection\nof neurodevelopmental disorders that cause lifelong neurobehavioral and craniofacial abnormalities. In 2020,\nthe Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that approximately 1 in 7 pregnant women had\nconsumed alcohol in the past month, which is in line with increasing trends since 2011. Thus, PAU is a major\nand growing public health problem, so it is imperative to understand the risk factors for PAU to inform\nprevention and intervention. Stress is one such key risk factor. Pregnant women with frequent stress have a 3-\nfold higher risk of binge drinking than pregnant women without frequent stress. Furthermore, pre-pregnancy\nalcohol use is consistently associated with PAU, suggesting that understanding the etiology of alcohol misuse\noutside of pregnancy is essential for preventing PAU. Correspondingly, stress plays a crucial role in Alcohol\nUse Disorder (AUD) in women outside of pregnancy, as women are more vulnerable to relapse following\nstressful triggers relative to men. This vulnerability may in part be driven by sex/gender (SG) differences in\nneurocircuitry related to processing stress in AUD. Increased stress vulnerability has been linked to\ndysfunction in the \u201csalience network\u201d (SN), which is a collection of brain regions, primarily the insula, the dorsal\nanterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule, that responds to salient, potentially stressful stimuli and is\nalso highly reactive to substance use cues, including alcohol. Furthermore, social support may serve as a\nresilience factor against stress-related alcohol misuse, particularly in women. If and how social support can\nalso buffer the brain\u2019s heightened vulnerability to stress in AUD, and if there are SG differences in this effect,\nremains to be examined. Moreover, whether stress and social support similarly affect PAU is unclear. My\noverarching hypothesis is that women, relative to men, are more vulnerable to stress-related alcohol misuse\nvia enhanced SN reactivity; however, social support will have a stronger buffering effect on this relationship in\nwomen. The specific aims of this project are to (1A) assess SG differences in the role of the SN on the\nrelationship between stress reactivity and alcohol use levels in people with AUD, (1B) assess SG differences in\nwhether social support protects against alcohol misuse by altering stress-related SN reactivity, and (2)\ndetermine risk and protective factors for prenatal alcohol use. Achieving these goals will inform scientifically-\ngrounded treatments for AUD in women during and outside of pregnancy, as well as prepare me for a\nsuccessful career as a physician-scientist in academic medicine.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive. Inheritance of the apolipoprotein (APO) E4 allele\nis the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic late onset AD, whereas the APOE2 allele is protective and the\nmost common APOE3 allele is neutral. While the mechanisms by which APOE4 modifies the risk of AD are not\nfully elucidated, compelling evidence indicates that the pathogenic effects of APOE4 are mediated by lipid-\nrelated pathways. Integrative multi-omics studies have consistently demonstrated the strong association of lipid\npathways with AD phenotypes and that APOE4 disrupts intra/intercellular lipid homeostasis in cellular, organoid,\nand animal models as well as postmortem brain tissue from individuals carrying different APOE alleles with or\nwithout AD. Intriguingly, emerging evidence suggests that specific species of lipids/metabolic alterations in\nsubcellular organelles, in particular mitochondria, lead to neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Mitochondria are\nthe powerhouse of cells and provide the energy to sustain vital cellular functions. Notably, brain contains two\nmajor populations of mitochondria, the synaptic mitochondria that originate from the synaptic bouton of neurons\nand the non-synaptic mitochondria that originate from neuronal and glial cell bodies. Lipidomic analysis indicates\nthat synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria have distinct lipid profiles that regulate compartmental energy\nmetabolism in the brain. Importantly, dysfunction of mitochondria, especially synaptic mitochondria, is well\nestablished as one of the earliest deficits in the progression of AD. APOE4 has been associated with increased\nimpairment of mitochondrial structure and function compared with APOE3 in various models and human patients.\nHowever, whether APOE genotypes regulate the lipidome of mitochondria during brain aging and whether the\ndynamic changes of mitochondrial lipidomes affect the progression of AD are unknown. We hypothesize that\nmitochondrial lipidomic dynamics and its interaction with APOE4 drive pathogenic brain aging and AD. Three\nindependent yet interrelated specific aims are proposed to test the hypothesis, using both mouse models and\nhuman brains and a combination of behavioral and pathological approaches, coupled with innovative targeted\nand unbiased cellular, molecular technologies, including lipidomics, transcriptomics, and brain clearing and 3D\nimaging. Aim 1 is to assess the impact of APOE isoforms on mitochondrial lipidomic dynamics associated with\nbrain aging in humanized APOE4 and APOE3 mice. Aim 2 is to elucidate the relationship between mitochondrial\nlipidomic dynamics and the progression of cognitive deficits and amyloid pathology in APP/PS1 mice. Aim 3 is\nto define the interaction of mitochondrial lipidome with different APOE isoforms and its relation to cognitive\nfunction and AD pathology in human brains. The results are expected to uncover the impact of mitochondrial\nlipidomic dynamics and its interaction with APOE on brain aging and AD, and identify novel targets/pathways\nthat can be harnessed as diagnostic biomarkers and/or for therapeutic development to defeat AD.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a devastating worldwide pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory\nSyndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the United States alone, there have been over 35 million confirmed\ncases and Covid-19 has claimed more than 600,000 lives, and the pandemic is still rampant around the globe.\nWhile SARS-CoV-2 can infect people at all ages, senior populations are at greatest risk of severe disease and\nworse outcomes. Although Covid-19 is initially a respiratory disease, it subsequently causes damage to multiple\norgan systems, including the brain. Clinical findings indicate that neurological symptoms are widely observed in\npatients with Covid-19 and approximately 33% of Covid-19 survivors suffer from persistent neurological\nimpairment. Emerging evidence also shows that people carrying the apolipoprotein (APO) E4 gene, the strongest\ngenetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection with\nhigher severity and mortality than people carrying the APOE3 gene. In addition, older adults with AD or other\ndementias are at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19 and experiencing more severe outcomes than are people\nwithout dementia. These findings suggest that age, APOE genotype, and AD/dementia status modify the risk,\nseverity, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Further,\nwhile the acute effects of Covid-19 on brain functions are well documented, the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-\n2 infection (\u201clong-Covid\u201d) is currently unknown. We hypothesize that the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with age,\nAPOE genotype, and the context of AD-type neuropathology at the blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers modulate\nboth systemic and neuroinflammation, dictating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on brain function. Three\nindependent yet interrelated specific aims are proposed to test the hypothesis, using multiple mouse models and\na combination of virology, immunology and neurobehavioral approaches, coupled with innovative targeted and\nunbiased cellular, molecular technologies, including single cell/nucleus transcriptomics, spatial genomics, and\n3D brain clearing and imaging. Aim 1 is to assess the acute and long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on\nneuropathophysiology in normal aging in WT mice. Aim 2 is to define the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with\ndifferent APOE isoforms and its impact on the temporal onset and severity of cognitive impairment and\nneuropathology in human APOE4/4 and APOE3/3 mice. Aim 3 is to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection\non the progression of cognitive deficits and AD neuropathology in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Results from these\nproposed studies are expected to define the short- and long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cognitive\nfunction and pathogenic processes in aging and AD, and provide novel insights into the underlying cellular and\nmolecular mechanisms so that effective interventions may be developed to prevent the neurological and\nneurocognitive sequelae from SARS-CoV-2 infection in aging and AD.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nTourette Syndrome (TS) is a chronic, childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1-3% of people\nand is associated with adverse functional impacts. TS is characterized by tics, which are involuntary, repetitive\nmovements and vocalizations. A current challenge in clinical care for TS is the lack of objective, quantitative,\nscalable tools to measure tics for the purposes of diagnosis and symptom severity monitoring. The overall\nobjective of the proposed study is to use video-based methods in a large, diverse community sample to inform\nquantitative and automated phenotyping of tics. This study builds on prior work, including: 1) video-based\nobservational methods with trained human raters to quantify tics for research purposes, 2) computer vision and\nmachine learning techniques for movement analysis and medical diagnostic aids, and 3) preliminary data\nindicating supervised learning methods can be used to automate detection of eye tics with high accuracy. In\nAim 1, videos and clinical data from N = 1,000 individuals with tics will be collected using remote and\ninternet-based methods. A deep phenotyping approach will be used to quantitatively describe the phenotypic\nspectrum of observable motor and vocal tics, empirically derive tic severity benchmarks, and identify patient\nsubgroups. In Aim 2, our computer vision team will apply supervised machine learning methods to Aim 1 data\nto create an algorithm capable of detecting the most common tics. Aim 3 will prospectively test the Aim 2\nalgorithm in N = 60 patients who completed TS treatment in a separate clinical trial to establish the algorithm\u2019s\nsensitivity to change and convergent validity with current gold-standard tic severity measurement. This project\nwill enable us, for the first time, to quantify the spectrum of observable tics in a large community sample,\nknowledge that will have immediate clinical relevance for diagnostic decision making and patient education.\nAim 2 will yield a computer algorithm capable of autonomously quantifying the most common motor tics, a\ncritical next step toward developing accurate, clinically valid, and scalable assessments for tic screening,\ndiagnosis, treatment decision making, and symptom quantification in clinical trials.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nChronic tics affect 1-3% of youth in the US and are a disabling neuropsychiatric symptom associated with\nmultiple childhood-onset mental disorders. Tic suppression using Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for\nTics (CBIT) is the current first-line, gold-standard therapy for tics. However, many patients do not fully benefit\nfrom CBIT, likely because they lack the fundamental tic suppression ability that CBIT aspires to enhance. Our\npreliminary data and the literature show that tic suppression ability can be enhanced with inhibitory repetitive\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the supplementary motor area (SMA). SMA is a key node of\ncortico-striatal circuits and is known to be hyperactive and hyperconnected in tic disorders. We therefore\nanticipate that combining CBIT with inhibitory stimulation of SMA may facilitate higher CBIT response rates.\nThis study will test whether augmenting CBIT with inhibitory, noninvasive stimulation of SMA normalizes\nactivity in SMA-mediated circuits and enhances tic suppression ability in young people with tic disorder. The\nR61 phase will compare two rTMS regimens, 1 Hz rTMS and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS),\nagainst sham stimulation. R61 aims will test engagement of brain (SMA-mediated circuits) and behavior (tic\nsuppression ability) targets and identify the optimal rTMS regimen. To this end, 60 youth ages 12-21 years with\nchronic tics will complete 10 daily sessions of CBIT plus randomly assigned rTMS regimen, with fMRI,\nbehavioral, and clinical assessments before and after treatment. The R33 phase will investigate the effects of\nCBIT augmentation with the optimal rTMS regimen in a double blinded randomized control trial in a new\nsample of 60 youth with chronic tics. R33 aims test the link between target engagement and functional\noutcomes, examine the clinical trajectory of the dose-response relationship, and assess intervention durability\nat 1 month follow-up. TMS targeting in both phases will be informed by individualized electric field modeling.\nThis project will establish CBIT+rTMS as a treatment for chronic tics and provide a model for mechanistically\nstudying pediatric interventions combining behavior therapy with neurostimulation. Results from this line of\nresearch will inform TMS therapy augmentation strategies and improve our understanding of neural\nmechanisms underlying CBIT, TMS, and tics.",

    "abstract_text": "This proposed study concerns the proteolytic machinery that regulates tissue aging, inflammation, and\nmetabolic deregulation. The proteasome population is largely shifted from the standard proteasome to the\nimmunoproteasome under inflammation. The immunoproteasome is different from the standard proteasome\nin the 20S core three catalytic subunits. It has distinct processing kinetics and cleavage preferences, and\nassociates with the 11S regulatory complex to perform ATP- and ubiquitination-independent degradation of\nproteins. Its expression is highly increased in high fat diet mouse liver and in liver biopsies from patients who\nhave chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis. The immunoproteasome level is highly increased in pathological\nhepatocytes from human in direct correlation with the histopathological grade of inflammation. The\nimmunoproteasome is highly induced in aged mouse and rat tissues. Its prolonged presence can cause\nchronic inflammation and tissue damages and can have devastating effects on the stability of proteins, many\nof which are anti-inflammatory factors or homeostatic factors otherwise stable. Our study is based on the\noverarching concept that the immunoproteasome plays the major role in inflammation-specific degradation of\nproteins. The degradation may cause metabolic reprogramming and the transition between glycolysis and\noxidative phosphorylation, shifting the cellular metabolism that fits in the inflammatory conditions. The long-\nterm goal of our study is to understand the functions of the immunoproteasome in inflammatory metabolic\ndiseases. Its strong relevance with inflammation, its immunological aspect of regulation, its dynamic nature,\nand its high expression in immune cells and aged tissues and high fat diet mouse tissues all point toward the\npossibility that the immunoproteasome might play crucial roles in inflammatory metabolic diseases. The\nobjective of this proposed study is to define the mechanisms by which the immunoproteasome regulates\nenergy metabolism via the selective digestion of key metabolic regulators. Despite its discovery nearly three\ndecades ago, its specific function remains largely unknown other than its role in producing antigenic peptides.\nWe have identified several regulators of the mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism under the control by\nthe immunoproteasome. We hypothesize that the immunoproteasome induces metabolic reprogramming by\ndigestion of proteins involved in metabolic homeostasis. Although we do not exclude the possibility that the\nreprogramming might be protective in early stages of stress response, we hypothesize that its excessive,\nprolonged presence disturbs metabolic homeostasis. This grant will focus on the 11S-associated\nimmunoproteasome, the major type of the proteasome during inflammation. We will pursue three specific\naims. First, we will determine how the immunoproteasome perturbs mitochondrial metabolism using mouse\nand cellular models. Second, we will define the role of PA28alpha-associated immunoproteasome in hepatic\nmetabolism. Third, we will identify the molecular factors that mediate 11S-immunoproteasome functions.",

    "abstract_text": "The protein kinase mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathways play crucial roles in regulating cell\ngrowth, survival, and metabolism in response to changes in cellular energy and nutrient status. Despite\nsignificant efforts, our understanding of mTOR pathways still has many gaps that need to be filled. To\naddress the knowledge gaps, our research will focus on three directions. Firstly, we will investigate the\nmechanisms by which mTOR controls the initiation and termination of autophagy. Although our knowledge\nin this area has significantly improved, we still do not clearly understand how post-translational modifications,\ninteractions, and translocations of autophagy regulators are coordinated to drive autophagy initiation.\nFurthermore, while mTOR regulates autophagy termination, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.\nSecondly, we will investigate how cells decide between autophagy, mitophagy, and apoptosis during energy\ncrisis caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. Our recent study has challenged the long-held notion that\nautophagy is responsible for supplying energy to energy-deprived cells for survival. Contrary to the prevailing\nconcept, we found that energy-deprived cells restrain autophagy and mitophagy via activating AMPK, the\nmajor energy sensor kinase in mammalian cells. Our research has revealed previously unrecognized roles\nof ULK1, the central kinase that regulates autophagy downstream of mTOR, in the crosstalk between\nautophagy, mitochondria, and apoptosis. This finding highlights the critical importance of maintaining\nfunctional mitochondria for autophagy. Investigating the coordination mechanism underlying the crosstalk\nbetween autophagy, mitophagy, and apoptosis during energy stress is crucial for a comprehensive\nunderstanding of cellular energetics for cell survival. Thirdly, we will investigate the functions of mTOR in\ndifferent cellular compartments. The majority of previous studies have focused on lysosomal mTOR, with\nlimited explanation of how lysosomal mTOR controls protein synthesis and autophagy initiation that primarily\noccur in the endoplasmic reticulum. While non-lysosomal functions of mTOR have recently emerged, their\nroles in different cellular compartments remain largely unexplored. Through our single-molecule analysis,\nwe have learned that the majority of mTOR exists in non-lysosomal compartments and that some forms of\nnon-lysosomal mTOR are responsive to amino acids, providing unprecedented insights into mTOR\ndistribution and regulation in various cellular locations. Addressing this critical knowledge gap is essential\nfor elucidating previously unrecognized functions of mTOR. Through these three directions of research, our\nstudy aims to advance fundamental knowledge on mTOR functions in coordinating nutrient, growth, and\nenergy status with autophagy, mitophagy, and cell survival. Additionally, the outcomes of this study are\nexpected to provide crucial insights into the cellular pathways for energy sensing and response, as well as\nthe mechanisms by which cells cope with energy stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nBackground: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has a lifetime prevalence of nearly 30%, with 14.4 million adults in\nthe US currently in need of treatment. Even with treatment, 50-80% of individuals relapse within a year.\nMechanisms underlying recovery are still not well understood, specifically individual differences underlying\nrelapse risk. Preliminary data: The work of others and our preliminary data support the involvement of at least\nthree neuro-behavioral mechanisms in the maintenance of AUD: 1) reward reactivity, 2) aversive reactivity and\n3) executive control. Using a data-driven machine learning approach in a non-clinical community sample\n(N=1204; 46% male), we demonstrated that the top predictors of alcohol abuse constituted independent,\nadditive factors of this three-domain model. Our preliminary analyses on subtyping in chronic poly-drug users\n(N=40; 75% male) and individuals with past AUD (N=74; 32% male), demonstrated that data-driven machine\nlearning approaches can be used to study individual differences in these multi-factorial impairments. We found\nthree distinct \u2018subtypes\u2019 in AUD: a \u201creward drinker\u201d type (increased reward reactivity), a \u201crelief drinker\u201d type\n(increased aversive reactivity) and a \u201clow functioning drinker\u201d type (low executive control). Goals and\nHypothesis: The immediate goal of this project in AUD is to develop a sparse personalized relapse prediction\ntool that can be employed in a treatment setting to continuously track relapse risk over time. The long-term\ngoal is to determine if relapse prevention interventions can be personalized. The underlying hypothesis is that\ndifferent combinations of independent factors underlie AUD maintenance and relapse per individual. We will\ntest this by Aim I: determining individual differences in function on three domains (reward reactivity, aversive\nreactivity, executive control), and Aim II: evaluating the predictive power of subtype- or domain-specific relapse\nprediction models versus an AUD-general model, to determine their respective clinical utility. Specific Aims: In\nAim 1, we will assess individual differences underlying AUD across the three domains of interest using a multi-\nmethod approach (personality, neurocognition, clinical assessments, task/resting fMRI brain function) in a large\ntreatment cohort (N=200 AUD, 2-5 weeks into treatment, >40% female; N=100 controls). In Aim 2, we will\nfollow our sample clinically (+6, +12 months) and employ machine learning methods to evaluate if the patterns\nof impairments underlying relapse risk are distinctly different between individuals. Innovation: This study\nprovides a) a systematic, multi-method assessment of the individual heterogeneity in the neuro-behavioral\nmechanisms underlying AUD; b) an application of big data analytical approaches for relapse prediction to an\nAUD dataset; and c) the development of sparse yet highly informative personalized relapse prediction tools.\nSummary: This study will pave the way for the development of personalized relapse prediction tools that track\nrelapse risk in AUD over time. This can ultimately lead to the development of personalized treatment\napproaches, with the potential to dramatically transform the current treatment landscape.",

Understanding how connectivity changes with drugs is essential\nfor determining the mechanisms of addiction. Recent innovations in neuroimaging have allowed scientists to\nstudy neural connectivity across the whole brain. This work has taken place mostly in humans. At the same time,\ninvasive methods in animal models have led to a wealth of information on cellular changes. However, these two\napproaches remain largely disconnected. The Addiction Connectome Core (ACC) will bridge this translational\ngap by supporting the development of a whole-brain, multimodal connectome in rodents and non-human\nprimates.

In addition to\ndeveloping novel imaging tools (e.g., dopaminergic imaging) and collecting core data for the connectome, we\nwill also facilitate the integration of complementary data from Center Users and researchers outside of University\nof Minnesota. The ACC will integrate and make publicly available data bearing on its mission from three sources:\n(1) data specifically collected for the Core, (2) data collected by the other Cores (Structural Circuits Core and\nAddiction Neural Dynamics Core), and (3) data collected by extramural scientists.

    "abstract_text": "Our goal is to develop small-molecule drugs for treatment of skeletal muscle disorders related to\ndysregulation of intracellular calcium, focusing on specific proteins in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).\nEach Aim starts with the design of fluorescent biosensors (specific SR proteins labeled with fluorescent donor\nand acceptor), to be used in high-throughput screening (HTS) of small molecules. A key innovation is our recently\ndeveloped HTS approach based on fluorescence lifetime (FLT) detection of protein structural changes by\nfluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Our combination of FRET biosensor engineering with\nunique FLT detection has produced an unprecedented combination of sensitivity, specificity, speed, and\nprecision in protein structure-based studies of mechanism for drug discovery. We previously validated this\napproach through applications to cardiac muscle. We now focus on skeletal muscle, targeting the two key SR\nproteins involved in Ca regulation, the Ca release channel (RyR1) and the calcium pump (SERCA1a).\nAim 1: Targeting RyR1 leak reduction. Our biosensor is based on FRET between two regulatory proteins\n(FKBP12.0 and CaM) bound to RyR1. In pilot screens, we have shown that this FLT-based FRET assay can\ndetect small molecules that restore aberrant RyR1 function, in which the Ca channel leaks Ca from the SR into\nthe cytoplasm, inducing myopathies. We will carry out larger-scale screening, to identify new drug candidates,\nthen use cellular and in vivo muscle assays to test the reversal of undesirable calcium leak in fibers and mice.\nAim2: Targeting SERCA1a activation. We seek a complementary solution to combat Ca leak \u2013 enhancing\nSERCA1a activity to pump Ca back into the SR lumen. This approach also targets factors (e.g., mutation or\noxidation) that impair SERCA1a activity. We will use two complementary approaches, building on our previous\nstudies with SERCA2a (cardiac), with fluorescent biosensors expressed in live cells. (A) We will use an\nintramolecular FRET biosensor (donor and acceptor attached to different domains of SERCA1a), to screen a\nsmall-molecule library to detect compounds that bind to SERCA, alter enzyme structure, and activate Ca\ntransport. (B) We will use an intermolecular biosensor, with donor on SERCA1a and acceptor on the SERCA1a\nregulator sarcolipin (SLN), to detect compounds that activate the enzyme by uncoupling the inhibitory effects of\nSLN. We will evaluate potency and efficacy of drug candidates, using assays on myofibers and muscles, both in\nvitro and in vivo in mouse models including pre-clinical longitudinal drug testing.\n We have assembled a multi-PI team with complementary expertise and decades of successful collaboration,\nled by David Thomas (SERCA1a, FLT-FRET), Razvan Cornea (RyR1, biosensor engineering), and Dawn Lowe\n(skeletal muscle functional analysis). We will also be joined by collaborators with complementary expertise in\nmedicinal chemistry (Aldrich) and myofiber Ca assays (Launikonis), and two consultants with unique expertise\non animal models of disorders in muscle Ca regulation (Dirksen and Hamilton).",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nOur long-term goals are to understand intracellular active Ca transport in cardiac muscle and to develop drugs\nthat target Ca dysregulation in heart failure. We focus on the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca-\nATPase (SERCA2a), the large membrane enzyme that pumps Ca into the SR to relax myocytes after\ncontraction, and on SERCA\u2019s regulatory proteins (regulins, RLN): phospholamban (PLB), sarcolipin (SLN)\nand dwarf open reading frame peptide (DWORF). Ample experimental and clinical data indicates that\nactivation of muscle Ca transport is a powerful approach to numerous severe and widely spread disorders,\nespecially heart disease. Over decades, we have developed and used spectroscopic techniques to resolve the\nstructural mechanism of SERCA regulation by RLN. The challenge is great due to the complexity of the Ca\ntransport mechanism, which involves dynamic protein-protein interactions, and RLN mechanisms of action are\nunclear or controversial. We have recently demonstrated fluorescence lifetime (FLT) methods with exquisite\nprecision and resolution of protein structural changes, with high-throughput acquisition enabled by rapid\nscanning in a microplate reader. In screens of chemical libraries of \u226450,000 small-molecules, we have\nidentified multiple types of SERCA activators. We are poised to implement early-stage drug discovery\ncampaigns targeting the SERCA-RLN interaction, to identify compounds with therapeutic potential to treat Ca\ndysregulation in heart failure. Our central hypotheses: (1) compounds that shift SERCA-RLN structural state\nor binding have tissue-specific effects (2) compounds that enhance Ca-transport enhance myocyte contraction,\nand (3) have antiarrhythmic properties. Aim 1 will accelerate discovery of compounds that target SERCA-RLN\ninteraction. Aim 2 will test effects on SERCA function in cardiac SR, HEK cells expressing human SERCA2a,\nand in cardiomyocytes. These novel chemical probes will open new avenues to elucidate structure-function\nmechanisms characteristic of SERCA-RLN. Aim 3 will enable lead discovery, using medicinal chemistry to\ndevelop and test analogues of promising Hits from Aim 2. Outcomes of this program will be new lead-like\ncompounds, and a demonstrated systematic process targeting cardiac Ca-transport for drug discovery and\ndevelopment. This process will be ready for implementation in large-scale discovery and development\ncampaigns to be pursued in future academic-industrial partnerships. For impact, we bring together an\ninnovative combination of techniques, technologies, and experts focused on cardiac Ca transport regulation.\nThis project is designed to enable future translation, while also developing tools for mechanistic understanding.\nSERCA has emerged as a high-value therapeutic target for some of the greatest Public Health challenges, not\nonly in the heart (heart failure, arrhythmia) but also in skeletal muscle (muscular dystrophy, sarcopenia) and\nnon-muscle cells (Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, obesity, cancer), so the significance of our proposed research\nprogram is great and extends well beyond cardiology.\n1",

    "abstract_text": "A group of investigators seeks to renew support for the Minnesota Muscle Training Program (MMTP), the NIH\nT32 interdisciplinary training program in muscle research at the University of Minnesota, for both predoctoral\nand postdoctoral scientists. This program began in 2001 with a primary focus on basic muscle research. Since\nthat time, UMN has placed a high priority on the expansion of muscle research at all levels, particularly\ntranslational research, aimed at the development of new therapeutic approaches. The institution has recruited\ninternationally prominent researchers in muscle disease and therapy and has established new facilities that\nsupport this research. In the previous funding period, further developments have led us to improve the quality of\nan already outstanding training program (which received a perfect score of 10 in 2011 and 2016), as measured\nby the funding and training records of the faculty; and by the number of qualified trainees, their publication record\nduring training, and their research career success after training. Program faculty are drawn from several\ndepartments, but their graduate students are enrolled in the interdepartmental graduate programs in\nBiochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics (BMBB) or Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology and\nGenetics (MCDBG), which share a common admissions program (Molecular Cellular and Structural Biology,\nMCSB) and first-year curriculum. The intellectual center of the training program is an intensive one-semester\ncourse entitled \u201cMuscle,\u201d directed by the MMTP Director and taught by the MMTP faculty, which emphasizes\nboth basic and translational research. This course has been expanded to accommodate an increasing\nemphasis on muscle disease and therapy. This is augmented by a weekly Muscle Journal Club, a biweekly\ninternal seminar program, a monthly external seminar including international leaders in muscle research, and an\nannual MMTP Symposium in which all members of the training faculty\u2019s research groups actively present and\ndiscuss their research, featuring a keynote speaker who is an internationally prominent muscle researcher. A\nsignificant strength of MMTP is its leadership. The Director (Thomas), who founded the program in 2001, is a\nworld leader in the molecular biophysics of muscle, has had NIH funding on muscle since 1980 (including two\nMERIT Awards), and has mentored more than 100 predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, most of whom have\ngone on to productive independent careers in muscle research. This program will now be strengthened by MPI\nstructure, with Thomas joined by Ervasti and Lowe. Ervasti is a world leader in the biochemistry of muscle\ndisease, and is Research Director for the Muscular Dystrophy Center, which is closely associated with MMTP.\nLowe is a world expert on muscle physiology in areas of aging, disease, and gender differences. The University\nprovides strong institutional support for MMTP, including a generous offer of matching funds. The primary\ngoal of MMTP is to help these exceptional predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to develop the intellectual and\ntechnical tools needed for productive careers as independent investigators and educators in muscle research.",

Conventional assessment methods for DLD\ncapture a child\u2019s current skill level in one language; in the U.S., such assessments are available only in English\nor Spanish. These methods fail sequential bilingual children, who speak a minority language at home and are\nsubsequently exposed to English, because they confound language-learning ability with prior language-\nlearning experience. Assessments that index language-learning ability are sorely needed, especially for\nsequential bilingual children whose home language is not Spanish. This project evaluates two novel approaches\nto language assessment for sequential bilingual children: dynamic assessment and processing-based\nassessment. Dynamic assessment methods offer language teaching during the assessment and evaluate the\nchild\u2019s response. Processing-based methods assess underlying skills that may drive language learning. This\nproject rigorously examines the psychometric properties of dynamic and processing-based assessments within\na diverse group of sequential bilingual children entering English-based schooling. We will recruit 165 children\naged 4 years, 10 months to 6 years, 2 months who speak any non-English language at home. The first study\ntimepoint will occur as children enter the school year and include an experimental assessment battery with\ndynamic assessments at the narrative and morpheme levels and both linguistic and non-linguistic processing-\nbased assessments. The assessment battery will be repeated 1 month later. Aim 1 establishes psychometric\nproperties of the experimental assessment battery, including internal consistency and test-retest reliability,\nfactor structure, and concurrent validity. Aims 2 and 3 then use a longitudinal design to examine predictive\nvalidity. Children will be followed over two academic years, with re-assessment every 4 months (totaling 5\ngrowth timepoints following the initial assessment and test-retest timepoint). At each growth timepoint,\nchildren will complete an English language sample and parents and teachers will be interviewed to assess the\nlanguage environment and presence of concerns regarding the child\u2019s language. We will construct models of\nEnglish growth that account for child-external factors (e.g., language environment, SES) and then determine\nhow well the experimental dynamic and processing-based assessment battery predicts this growth (Aim 2). We\nwill then identify a group of children at high risk of DLD based on the combination of poor English growth and\nparent or teacher concern regarding language development. Aim 3 will examine the sensitivity and specificity\nof the initial assessment battery for predicting DLD. Project results will demonstrate whether multiple dynamic\nassessment and processing-based assessment tools can reliably and validly measure language-learning ability\nacross variable language-learning environments. For millions of children who speak home languages other\nthan English, this project represents a critical step in validating language assessment tools.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nMulti-organ failure as a result of the systemic inflammatory response to injury (SIRS) is the leading cause\nof late complications and death after severe trauma and burn injury. Despite decades of research,\ntherapeutics that limit the SIRS response following injury remains an unmet clinical need. Emerging\nresearch points to the contribution of human-specific differences in our immune system that distinguish\nthe human injury response from that observed in other species. These species-specific differences may\nexplain why therapies that are widely successful in animal models used for preclinical research fail in\nhuman clinical studies. Uniquely human genes (UHGs), with expression that frequently tracks to human\nimmune cells, may account for some of these differences in human SIRS after injury. The overarching\ngoal of my research program is to systematically define factors that distinguish the human immune\nresponse from other species, characterize the contribution of UHGs to human SIRS, and understand how\nthese genes effect therapeutics that target anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. To this end, we have\nrecently discovered a novel role for the uniquely human CHRFAM7A gene that is a variant of the\nconserved \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAchR) that mediates cholinergic anti-inflammatory\nsignaling. In addition to decreasing the ability of therapeutics to target the \u03b17nAchR, unexpectedly, we\nhave demonstrated that human CHRFAM7A expression functions in transgenic mouse mice to cause\nincreased monocyte mobilization to lung and decreased acute lung injury in a model of severe burn injury.\nOur research focus in this MIRA proposal is to identify the function and mechanism of action of UHGs\nthat are highly expressed in monocytes/macrophages and relevant in the injury response. To\ndemonstrate the functional relevance of UHGs, we will use a combination of precision animal models,\ngenetic approaches in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and clinical samples from trauma and\nburn patients. In this research program, we propose to 1) test cell-specific UHG function in an animal\nmodel of severe injury; 2) develop an iPS cell system for mechanistic studies in human macrophages; 3)\ndetermine how UHGs alter the effect of therapeutics that target anti-inflammatory signaling pathways;\nand 4) evaluate how relative UHG expression alters the inflammatory phenotype of monocytes from\ninjured patients. Understanding how UHGs make the human immune response to injury unique may allow\nfor the development of novel therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating SIRS and decreasing organ\ndysfunction after severe trauma and burn.",

One of the most important interactions is the CD40-CD154 pathway. We will evaluate novel,\nclinically relevant therapeutics targeting either CD40 or CD154 and explore their role in facilitating tolerance.\nBased on our recent publication showing that CD11b is a novel alternate receptor for CD154 during\nalloimmunity, we will also test novel nanotechnology to block the CD154:CD11b interaction, an important\nmechanism of cross-talk between the innate and adaptive immune responses during transplantation.\nMoreover, based on our published data showing that memory T cells are a potent barrier to transplantation\ntolerance, we will determine the role of OX40-OX40L blockade to control alloreactive memory CD8+ T cells and\npromote a pro-regulatory environment. In addition, we will assess the importance of the VISTA pathway on the\ninduction of donor-specific tolerance using an agonistic anti-human VISTA antibody.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nWith thousands of patients now on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, it is obvious that there is a critical\nshortage of available donor organs. Xenotransplantation represents a promising solution. This effort is of\nparamount importance as a significant number of patients are more likely to die waiting rather than receive a life-\nsaving kidney transplant. The major limitation to the clinical translation of xenotransplantation has been the\ncross-species differences in cell surface carbohydrates/glycans and proteins that serve as targets for recipient-\nderived antibodies resulting in antibody mediated rejection. We have observed a bimodal distribution of rejection\nin the first year after pig to NHP kidney transplant with ~50% of recipients treated with our standard anti-CD154\ncontaining immunosuppression regimen experiencing rejection early (<100 days, MST 53 days, n=17) while the\nmajority of the remaining animals survive between 1 and 4.5 years (MST 422 days, n=17). Early graft loss is\nsecondary to antibody mediated rejection directed mostly at glycan related antigens. Late failure has features of\nchronic antibody mediated rejection and we have shown that this is directed mostly at SLA class II molecules.\nFor kidney xenotransplantation to have clinical utility we need to consistently prevent early antibody rejection\nwhile graft survival of at least 3 years in patients to achieve equipoise. In the current proposal we plan to study\nand address both early and late kidney xenograft failure. As antibody failure remains the most important problem\nwe will address this through data driven genetic engineering to remove known xenoantigens and test novel,\nclinically relevant strategies to control immune cells responsible for antibody production. We have identified\nadditional glycan xenoantigens that likely contribute to early antibody mediated rejection and have already\nproduced a new pig- GGTA1-/-/B4GALNT2-/-/B3GNT5-/- that we will test in our pig to primate kidney\nxenotransplant model. We will test whether the elimination of additional candidate antigens will reduce/eliminate\nthe early rejection we see in the first 100 days after transplant and provide consistency towards long-term\nsurvival. Late failure in our pig to NHP kidney transplant model is caused by chronic antibody mediated rejection\nwith antibody directed at SLA class II molecules being a major driver. In aim #2 we will use our already generated\nSLA class II molecule knock out pigs to evaluate the role of SLA DQ and SLA DR in late xenograft rejection. In\naim #3 we will target the cells responsible for antibody production using cutting-edge, clinically relevant therapies\nincluding a novel anti-CD19 depleting antibody and CD20 and CD19 specific NHP CAR T cell therapeutics to\ntest whether broader and deeper depletion of B cell subsets will prevent early antibody mediated rejection, reset\nthe B cell repertoire, and prevent late antibody mediated injury to the kidney xenograft. The proposed studies\naddress an important clinical problem-- the adequate supply of donor organs as well as critical scientific\nquestions- including what pathways/molecules are essential for the immune response to xenogeneic tissues.",

Project 2\nwill examine the efficacy and mechanisms of the ADL+TIS regimen in a kidney transplant model and apply high-\ndimensional immune profiling to guide protocol refinements, with the PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE of developing a safe,\neffective, and clinically translatable protocol for inducing stable tolerance in living donor kidney transplantation.\nWE HYPOTHESIZE that the ADL+TIS regimen, with modifications deemed necessary to facilitate successful\ntranslation to a solid organ transplant setting and with refinements informed by results of the overall U19 program,\npromotes long-term graft survival in living donor kidney transplant models in NHPs through operational tolerance.\nTo test this hypothesis and facilitate the clinical translation of ADL+TIS, we propose two SPECIFIC AIMS:\nAIM #1: To determine the efficacy and mechanisms of ADL infusions combined with transient\nimmunosuppression in inducing and maintaining tolerance in a NHP renal transplant model\nStudies determining the efficacy of the ADL+TIS protocol in achieving operational tolerance of renal allografts in\nNHPs will be accompanied by deep immune profiling of blood, graft, spleen, and urine to investigate the effects\nof the protocol on the abundance and activation profiles of distinct effector, exhausted, and regulatory immune\ncell subsets in various compartments and their spatial organization within graft and spleen.\nAIM #2: To study the efficacy and mechanisms of inflammasome inhibition and IL-1b antagonism to\npromote renal transplant tolerance induced by ADL infusions and transient immunosuppression in NHPs\nStudies in this Aim will determine the ability of strategies inhibiting the inflammasome and its products to\nsynergize with ADL+TIS in promoting operational tolerance in a renal transplant model in NHPs. Mechanistic\nstudies will investigate how inflammasome inhibition and IL-1b antagonism modify the effects of ADLs + TIS on\nfrequencies and activation profiles of myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets in blood, urine, and spleen and their\nrecruitment to and spatial interaction within coordinated immune regulation domains in the renal allograft.\nThe SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATION of the proposal lie in the efficacy of the ADL+TIS protocol to deplete and exhaust\nallospecific T cells and to create potent immune regulation. The prospects for tolerance induction to renal\ntransplants in NHPs are high, based on documented tolerance to renal transplants in rodents and islet transplants\nin NHPs and opportunities for rational refinements of the strategy created by system-level immune profiling.",

The IIC will perform assays to analyze the immune alterations in\nperipheral circulation, graft and spleen induced by the tolerance regimens proposed in Projects 1, 2 and 3. The\nTransplantation Tolerance Laboratory (TTL) has developed a series of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)\nto analyze the donor-specific immune responses in NHP transplant recipients that will be shared across all the\nprojects to harmonize the analyses proposed across all the projects in the U19 program. The Core has optimized,\nvalidated, and adopted several cutting-edge technologies and pipelines for bioinformatic data analysis of this\ncomplex dataset across multiple tissue compartments. Comprehensive immune analyses of samples from the 3\nprojects by the IIC will aid in avoidance of assay and analysis variations resulting in harmonization of results that\nwill aid in insights obtained in one model to be synergistically deployed across other projects. IIC will perform\nassays outlined in the four Specific Aims presented below and conduct bioinformatics and data analysis pipeline\nto assess the immune alterations induced by the distinct tolerance regimens utilized in the Projects 1, 2 and 3.\nAim 1: Define the alterations in the immune landscape of renal transplant recipients by high-dimensional CyTOF\nprofiling of circulating immune cells during induction and maintenance of tolerance. Aim 2: Generate and validate\nTCR signatures using single cell TCRseq to track donor-antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Aim 3: Define\nthe fate and function of donor-antigen specific CD4+ T cells with MHC class II tetramers and single cell ATAC\nand RNA sequencing in serial peripheral blood mononuclear cells of tolerant and rejecting renal allograft\nrecipients. Aim 4: Analyze the spatio-temporal organization of immune cells in renal allografts, spleen, and lymph\nnodes at the transcription level by Digital Spatial Profiling and at the protein level by MIBI-TOF. Analysis of\nmultiple tissue compartments longitudinally to generate a large, but highly controlled, dataset. We intentionally\napply this multi-omics approach to advantage parallel, rather than sequential, discrimination of system level\nanalyses of immune mechanisms that contribute to transplant tolerance. Analysis of samples from the 3 projects\nutilizing distinct tolerance regimens will provide new immunological insights on induction and maintenance of\ntolerance. Moreover, the performance of assays across projects supports lateral transfer of knowledge to identify\ncommonality, independent of strategy, revealing principal features underlying immune tolerance to advance\ntowards successful clinical application.

    "abstract_text": "Abstract/ Summary\nBlockade of CD40-CD154 interactions is known to be a highly effective means of inhibiting alloreactive T cell\nresponses and under some conditions inducing transplantation tolerance in both murine and non-human\nprimate models. However, the potential of this therapeutic strategy to have a transformative impact on\ntransplantation outcomes has yet to be realized. CD154 blockers were associated with adverse\nhypercoagulability in early clinical trials, instigating the therapeutic targeting of CD40 as an alternative therapy.\nHowever, CD40 blockers have failed in recent clinical trials due to insufficient efficacy. We therefore sought to\ndetermine if there is a biological explanation underlying the observed inferiority of blocking CD40 as compared\nto blocking CD154, in order to then devise ways to overcome it. In a 2020 study, we reported that CD11b is\na second receptor for CD154 during alloimmunity, signaling through which is blocked by anti-CD154\nreagents but not anti-CD40 reagents. We showed that CD154:CD11b interactions function locally within the\nallograft to enhance donor-reactive CD8+ T cell infiltration and accelerate allograft rejection. In addition, new\npreliminary data show that CD154 but not CD40 blockade results in the generation of graft-specific Foxp3+\niTreg, suggesting that the addition of CD154:CD11b blockade may boost iTreg generation in the context of\nanti-CD40. In this proposal, we will translate these findings into an NHP allogeneic renal transplant model to\nelucidate the role of CD154:CD11b blockade in transplantation tolerance, and to test a novel nanotherapeutic\nstrategy to better target CD154:CD11b interactions and synergize with anti-CD40 in promoting transplantation\ntolerance in vivo. In the first Aim, we will elucidate the mechanisms by which CD154:CD11b blockade\ncontributes to the inhibition of alloimmunity and the induction of Foxp3+ Treg, using novel techniques to identify\nand track alloreactive effector and regulatory T cells in NHP, and will use MIBI-TOF and transcriptomic\napproaches to interrogate the effects of blocking CD154:CD11b interactions on the immune architecture and\ntranscriptomic profile of T cells, DC, and macrophage/monocytes within allografts. In the second Aim, we have\ndeveloped a novel nanoparticle that is coated with a specific peptide inhibitor that prevents CD154:CD11b\nbinding. Utilizing cutting edge nanotechnology to block this interaction, instead of a monoclonal antibody, offers\nthe distinct advantage of the ability to bioengineer the nanoparticle with a separate immunomodulatory\n\u201cpayload\u201d to further promote tolerance. Given the demonstrated ability of CD154 blockade to induce long-term,\ndurable tolerance in NHP, our overall hypothesis is that combining the novel CD154:CD11b blocking\nnanoparticle with anti-CD40 will result in the establishment of transplantation tolerance.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nEwing sarcoma survival has not improved in decades despite long knowledge of its singular driving somatic\nmutation, the pernicious EWS-FLI1 fusion oncoprotein. As an aberrant transcription factor EWS-FLI1 alters\nexpression of thousands of genes enacting a complex program toxic to most cell types, so much so that the cell\nof origin for Ewing sarcoma is still a matter of debate. Ewing sarcoma occurs at starkly higher rates (roughly 10-\nfold) in children of European ancestry compared to those with primarily African ancestry, while Latino children\nhave roughly \u2154 and Asian children \u00bd the risk of Ewing sarcoma than do white children. Ancestry is in fact the\nstrongest known risk factor for Ewing sarcoma, but the molecular basis of these differences in risk have been\ninvestigated only sparingly. As the mechanisms by which EWS-FLI1 interacts with the genome have become\nclear, it is feasible with an appropriate model to investigate how genomic ancestry in general and at specific loci\nmodulates EWS-FLI1 activity including its downstream effects on epigenetic and transcriptional programs. To\nthis end we have devised a strategy to introduce EWS-FLI1 in derivatives of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)\nin order to characterize downstream molecular and functional consequences of EWS-FLI1 expression. Using\naccessible variant array data from several large stem cell repositories we identified banked iPSC lines derived\nfrom individuals with a range of European, African, and Amerind ancestry. We will introduce EWS-FLI1\nexpression at intermediate stages of development relevant to Ewing sarcomagenesis\u2014namely neural crest cells\nand mesenchymal stem cells. Measures of functional tolerance and molecular state will be compared to\ncorresponding samples from subjects with solely European ancestry. Globally we will examine whether gene\nexpression and chromatin state exhibits similarity to the Ewing expression signature in proportion to European\nancestry percentage. Genome-wide chromatin occupancy of EWS-FLI1 will be profiled and its relationship to\nlocal ancestry defined using long-read sequencing. Genes that are differentially influenced by EWS-FLI1 in\n\u201cpermissive\u201d (European ancestry), \u201cmoderately permissive\u201d (Amerind ancestry) and \u201cimpermissive\u201d (African\nancestry) genomes will be considered targets of potential therapeutic value and will undergo validation using\nCRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering and functional assays. The resulting data will represent the first and only\neffort, to our knowledge, to take advantage of the known differences in risk for Ewing sarcoma by ancestry to\nstudy EWS-FLI1 binding and downstream effects. In addition, we will make available the genome-scale data\nproduced by our study and freely distribute our iPSC models for wider use by Ewing sarcoma researchers.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nWhen we learn a complex behavior the nervous system must continuously drive new actions, compare\npredictions for the actions against outcomes, and strengthen or weaken the connections between neurons\n(synapses) in order to improve future actions. However, within the multilayer brain networks that control behavior,\nthe behavioral impact of modifying a synapse depends upon many downstream connections. Thus, learning\nrequires the brain solve a \u2018credit assignment\u2019 problem: information about which synaptic modifications should be\nmade is distributed across the network, yet must somehow be leveraged by local processes to guide change at\nindividual synapses. A major gap in our ability to relate behavioral events to synaptic change is the current lack\nof knowledge of these local processes that guide synaptic changes at individual neurons. Recent theories of\nlearning suggest that spikes generated in the apical dendrites of cortical neurons may play a key role in solving\nthis credit assignment problem. The experiments in this proposal will test the hypothesis that the apical dendrites\nof neurons in the pre-motor cortex integrate multiple learning-instructive feedback sources, and \u2013 under\nappropriate conditions \u2013 generate dendritic spikes that rapidly reconfigure the connectivity and function of\nneurons. In these experiments we will use advanced optical techniques to monitor and manipulate activity in the\ndendrites of a subset of neurons in the frontal cortex that have a well-delineated role in action planning. A key\nprediction of our hypothesis is that the activity of the apical dendrites reflects local credit-related calculations and\nthat this activity is distinct from the activity transmitted to other neurons by action potential generation near the\ncell body. We will test this using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging of cortical neurons during learning to\ndetermine how the behavioral selectivity of dendrites and cell bodies change with changing behavior. In order to\nidentify the contribution of dendritic spikes to learning, we will also use optogenetics to selectively suppress\nactivity in the apical dendrites during learning. Computational models also predict that dendritic spikes are\ngenerated by a mismatch between outcome information arriving from long-range feedback projections and local\ninhibition that predicts this feedback. To test this, we will combine synaptic glutamate imaging and optogenetics\nto map the selectivity and anatomical identity of feedback projections to the apical dendrites, and calcium imaging\nto determine the selectivity of local inhibitory neurons that target the apical dendrites. Together, these studies\nwill provide critical new insights into the circuit mechanisms governing cortical plasticity and credit assignment.\nIn doing so, they will provide a key framework for connecting complex learning with modifications at the individual\nsynapse level, and will build bridges between machine learning algorithms and models of biological neural\nnetworks.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nVirus-specific CD8 T cells exert potent antiviral activity against HIV-1 and SIV. Despite abundant\nCD8 T cell responses, these are unable to fully suppress virus replication. This is likely due to\nthe majority of viral replication occurring in CD4+ T cells concentrated in specific areas in the\nbody, such as B-cell follicles in secondary lymphoid tissues and in intestinal tissues. Viral\nreservoir studies indicate that the majority of SIV and HIV replication may occur in the intestinal\nmucosa: After ART interruption, the location, abundance, and phenotype of recrudescing virally\ninfected cells are not well understood. However, emerging data suggest that both CD4 T cells,\nas well as myeloid cells, in lymph node (LN) and the intestine are important contributors. Thus,\nthere is a need to develop methods to reduce viral load in mucosal tissues, as well as in LN,\nand to more fully understand the source of viral reservoirs in non-lymphoid tissues.

    "abstract_text": "HIV cure has proven elusive given the persistence of HIV in tissue sanctuaries including the central nervous system (CNS) and lymphoid follicles in people living with HIV (PLWH). Re-emerging data now indicate that myeloid cells in addition to CD4 T cells represent a key population contributing to HIV persistence in tissues and are a major source of viral rebound after antiretroviral therapy (ART) cessation. A better understanding of myeloid reservoirs are needed in order to guide effective cure strategies. Our long-term goals are to 1) understand HIV/SIV reservoirs in myeloid cells in the CNS, and 2) develop a cellular immunotherapy that targets virus-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to tissue reservoirs of HIV in the CNS and lymphoid tissues to durably suppress HIV replication. Our emerging data suggests that whilst most vRNA+ cells are CD4 T cells during chronic SIV infections, after analytical antiretroviral treatment interruption (ATI), the majority of vRNA+ recrudescing cells may be of myeloid origin in lymphoid tissues. It is unknown what cell types recrudesce HIV post-ATI in the CNS and this will be crucial if we are to have successful remission. In order to achieve sustained HIV remission our group is currently developing a one-time immunotherapeutic for durable remission of HIV in the absence of ART. This treatment is an autologous HIV-specific CAR (specifically CD4-MBL-CAR) T-cell therapy that targets B cell follicles, and may also penetrate the CNS and target cellular viral reservoirs. B cell follicles and the brain are immune protected sites that may permit viral persistence due to low levels of virus-specific CD8 T cells. We will investigate the capacity of CAR-T-cell immunotherapy to clear SIVmac251 in both CD4 T cells and myeloid cells in lymphoid and CNS reservoirs as this will be crucial for an effective HIV cure strategy either alone or in combination with other immuno and non-immunotherapy based approaches in humans. Therefore we hypothesize that myeloid cells in lymphoid and CNS tissue sites represent the predominant cell population responsible for viral recrudescence and using engineered CAR T cells that express CXCR5 will facilitate T-cell egress into both the CNS and lymphoid follicles and lead to durable remission. These pioneering advances will permit the development of animal model systems for cure research that are challenging and impossible to perform in human studies of the CNS for translatability to human clinical studies. Specifically, we propose to 1) To characterize the source of SIVmac251 rebound virus post-antiretroviral therapy treatment interruption (ATI) in the CNS and peripheral tissues, 2) To determine the location, abundance, and persistence of rhesus CAR/CXCR5 T cells in the CNS and their impact on SIVmac251 cellular reservoirs post ART release, and 3) To determine the ability of rhesus CAR/CXCR5 T cells to kill SIV infected myeloid cells in vitro.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT Virus-specific CD8 T cells exert antiviral activity against HIV-1/SIV in vitro and in vivo. Yet, despite\nthese responses in HIV-1-infected humans and SIV- infected macaques, they are unable to fully suppress virus\nreplication. This is likely due to the majority viral replication occurring in CD4+ T cells within B-cell follicles in\nsecondary lymphoid tissues; where virus-specific CD8 T cells are relatively few in number. In fact, we found that\nin vivo effector virus-specific CD8 T cell to target SIV RNA+ cell ratios (E:T) were over 40-fold lower inside\ncompared to outside of B cell follicles in lymphoid tissues. These findings indicate that B cell follicles are an\nimmune privileged site in which low levels of virus-specific CD8 T cells permit ongoing viral replication.\nFurthermore, we found that few virus-specific CD8 T cells express the follicular homing molecule CXCR5, likely\nexplaining their low levels in B cell follicles. These data suggest that the inability of virus specific CD8 T cells to\nfully suppress virus replication may be due to a deficiency of these T cells in B-cell follicles. These findings have\nled us to our central hypothesis that targeting HIV-specific immunotherapy to B cell follicles will lead to durable\nremission of HIV infection. In support of this hypothesis we have shown that increased levels of virus-specific\nCD8 T cells in B cell follicles is associated with lower viral loads. Although many immunotherapies utilize patient\nT cells to generate CAR-T therapies, there are special consideration in the treatment of HIV. One major short\ncomings of CAR-T approaches is the fact that T cells need to be autologous due to the risk of graft versus host\ndisease (GvHD), requiring complicated/expensive manufacturing processes of patient cells. This is also\nchallenging in the HIV setting as the patient T cells are already compromised and processing cells which may\ncontain active virus is risky. Alternatively, Natural Killer (NK) cells are highly suited for allogeneic use as they do\nnot cause GvHD and thus hold significant clinical potential as an off-the-shelf cellular product. Thuts, we propose\nto evaluate NK immunotherapy that targets virus-specific CAR NK cells (expressing CD4-MBL-CAR and CXCR5)\nto B cell follicles. Moreover, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout negative regulators of NK cell function, such\nas PD1, which we have previously shown to enhance NK cell function. Our long-term goal is to develop an\nintervention that will lead to durable remission of HIV infection using CAR NK cells. To test our hypotheses, we\npropose the following aims. 1) Develop reagents and methods to generate human and rhesus macaque\nCAR/CXCR5/PD1KO NK cells. 2) Determine the ability of CAR/CXCR5/PD1KO NK cells to migrate into B cell\nfollicles of SIV-infected rhesus macaques and to induce and maintain viral suppression. Our proposed studies\ntargeting CAR NK cells to follicles will have a broad impact on the field by providing insights into cell trafficking,\npersistence, and pre-conditioning regimens for NK immunotherapy. Moreover, our methods for engineering\nrhesus macaque NK cells will enable studies assessing the therapeutic use of NK cells in preclinical NHP models.\nMoreover, these studies could result in an effective strategy to induce long-term sustained remission of HIV.",

Numerous skeletal muscle\ndiseases cause marked contractile dysfunction leading to significantly diminished overall wellbeing and lifespan\nin humans. Therefore, preventing or reversing muscle dysfunction has significant health relevance. This proposal\nfocuses on the sarcomere - the functional unit of striated muscle \u2013 known to underlie multiple forms of contractile\ndysfunction. In Nemaline myopathy, severe muscle weakness arises from hypoactive sarcomeres, while the\nsevere muscle contractures characteristic of Distal Arthrogryposis stem from hyperactive sarcomeres. Other\ndisorders, including inherited Muscular dystrophies, also involve altered sarcomere function. These diseases\nestablish the sarcomere as a crucial, yet highly underserved, target for therapeutic intervention. Skeletal muscle\ndiseases involving defective sarcomeres have no cure or effective treatments. A major challenge to progress\ncenters on the inherent complexities of sarcomere regulation. Recently, novel ON/OFF myosin cross-bridge\nactivation states under mechano-sensing regulatory control have been proposed to interface with the troponin-\ntropomyosin system to regulate contraction. Working together, through dynamic inter-myofilament signaling, this\nnew view of sarcomere regulation has significant implications for muscle health and disease. To date, the data\nsupporting this model derives mainly from biophysical studies, with physiological relevance unclear and critical\nto elucidate. We developed and validated a novel FRET-based sarcomere activation biosensor integrated into\nthe myofilaments of intact skeletal muscle. Preliminary data shows the biosensor detects conformational\nchanges in troponin, serving as a signaling nexus for real time reporting load-dependent inter-myofilament\nsignaling regulation of sarcomere activation during physiological contractions in live skeletal muscles. Guiding\nhypothesis: Healthy skeletal muscle function requires precise sarcomere activation accomplished by dynamic\ninter-myofilament signaling wherein thin filament regulation initiates and myosin sustains sarcomere activation\nduring physiological contraction; consequently, defective inter-myofilament signaling causes disease. The Aims\nare to investigate physiological mechanisms of inter-myofilament signaling in regulating sarcomere activation\nduring twitch contractions in intact skeletal muscles and to investigate the effects myosin binding protein C as a\nkey mechano-sensor governing inter-myofilament signaling processes in regulating sarcomere activation during\ntwitch contractions in intact skeletal muscles. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying physiologically relevant\nmechano-sensitive inter-myofilament signaling will provide the essential framework for advancing new\ntherapeutic discoveries to retain healthy skeletal muscle performance throughout lifespan, and to restore normal\nskeletal muscle function in inherited myopathies.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nIschemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure are the leading causes of combined morbidity and mortality in\nhumans. Herein, sarcomere dysfunction has a central role in disease pathogenesis. The sarcomere is the\nessential functional unit of cardiac muscle, directly responsible for the pumping action of the heart. The cardiac\nsarcomere is a multimeric contractile apparatus consisting of a thin myofilament-based allosteric regulatory\ncomplex together with the myosin-based thick myofilament that generates force. Interlacing myofilaments\noperate in synchrony to regulate and generate the forces necessary for heart performance. Beat-to-beat control\nof cardiac sarcomere activation refers to the status of the thin filament regulatory system in controlling the degree\nto which contraction is turned on and off during a twitch. Disruption in sarcomere function underlies the basis for\nnumerous forms of acquired and inherited heart diseases affecting millions of people in this country. Thus, focus\nhere on mechanistic insights into sarcomere regulation underscores the major health relevance of this proposal.\nRecently, emerging results have come to the fore positing synergistic inter-myofilament regulatory signaling\nmechanisms, including a new role of myosin cross-bridge ON/OFF states in controlling muscle contraction.\nBuilding on our sarcomere activation innovations featuring single unloaded cardiac myocytes, we have made a\nbreakthrough methodological advance, permitting real-time recordings of sarcomere activation in intact cardiac\nmuscle under physiological load. This system is capable of detecting, by intramolecular FRET, multiple\nmyofilament activating ligands during the physiological time course of a single twitch contraction in intact cardiac\nmuscle under load. Guiding hypothesis: During physiologically relevant twitch contractions under load, thin\nfilament activation is controlled dynamically by multiple synergistic inter-myofilament regulatory inputs, including\nTnC bound Ca2+, TnI switch domain-TnC interaction, OFF to ON state myosin cross-bridges, and MyBP-C in live\ncardiac muscle. This proposal aims to investigate inter-myofilament signaling by altering the TnI molecular switch\nmechanism during the physiological time-course of a single cardiac twitch in live cardiac muscles under load; to\ninvestigate the mechanism of inter-myofilament signaling during the cardiac twitch contraction in live intact\ncardiac muscles by modification in myosin cross-bridges; and to investigate the role MyBP-C in inter-myofilament\nsignaling during physiological twitch contractions in intact cardiac muscles. Enabled by our innovative approach,\nthe new insights into inter-myofilament signaling mechanisms gained here will significantly impact our\nunderstanding of cardiac function. In turn, this provides the essential foundation to guide new therapeutic\ndiscovery for the diseased heart by leveraging the sarcomere as an excellent target for developing new\ntreatments and therapies for the diseased heart.",

Yet, our understanding of such disorders is largely restricted to a description of symptoms, and\nthe treatments remain palliative. Several large-scale efforts, including the Human Connectome Project (HCP)\nand the BRAIN Initiative call for the development of technologies to map brain circuits to improve our\nunderstanding of brain function. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a central role in these initiatives as a\npowerful non-invasive methodology to study the human brain, including anatomical, functional and diffusion\nimaging. Yet, MRI methods have major limitations on achievable resolutions and acquisition speed. These\naffect both high resolution whole brain acquisitions that aim to image voxel volumes that contain only a few\nthousand neurons for improved understanding of the brain, and also the more commonly utilized research and\nclinical protocols. This, in turn, necessitates improved reconstruction methods to facilitate faster acquisitions.\nSeveral strategies have been proposed for improved reconstruction of MRI data. Recently, deep learning (DL)\nhas emerged as an alternative for accelerated MRI showing improved quality over conventional approaches.\nHowever, it also faces challenges that hinder its utility, especially in high-resolution brain MRI, including need\nfor large databases of reference data for training, concerns about generalization to unseen pathologies not\nwell-represented in training datasets, robustness issues related to recovery of fine structures, and difficulties in\ntraining networks for processing multi-dimensional image series. In this proposal, we will develop and validate\nrobust and efficient learning strategies for high-resolution brain DL MRI reconstruction without large databases\nof reference data. We will develop self-supervised learning methods for training with small referenceless\ndatabases or in a scan-specific manner. We will augment these with uncertainty-guided training strategies for\nimproved recovery of areas with high uncertainty, methods for synergistically combining random matrix theory\nbased denoising with DL reconstruction, and memory-efficient distributed learning techniques to process large\nimage series. Our developments will enable at least a two-fold improvement in acceleration rates over existing\nprotocols, and at higher resolutions. They will be validated on HCP-style acquisitions with extensive\nanatomical, functional and microstructural evaluation at multiple resolutions. Finally, we will curate a whole\nbrain sub-millimeter HCP-style database for studying functional and structural connectivity at the level cortical\nlayers and columns, while also facilitating technical developments for new modeling, image processing and\nreconstruction algorithms. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform the scales that\ncan be imaged with MRI, improve the quality of existing protocols and/or significantly reduce scan times,\nleading to reductions in healthcare costs, improved diagnosis and/or increased patient throughput.",

Our TRD in\nthe first phase has been at the forefront of these developments, introducing multiple new technologies for\nimproved DL reconstruction and training, interpretable image denoising, and fast iterative algorithms, which\nwere applied to Cartesian, non-Cartesian and novel encoding strategies beyond Fourier encoding. These new\nMRI reconstruction methods have also pushed the imaging technologies in other TRDs, CPs and SPs forward\nto target higher resolutions and acceleration rates at lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), as well as to combine\ninformation across multiple nuclei or even modalities. Consequently, these targets necessitate newer\ntechnologies for image reconstruction and denoising, an interplay with image acquisition, and new approaches\nfor multi-nuclei and multi-modal computational imaging. Each of these directions correspond to a specific\ninverse problem with its own distinct forward operator dictated by the underlying imaging physics.\nOur goal in this TRD is to link these inverse problems through the lens of intelligent physics-driven\ntechnologies that synergistically utilize imaging physics and advances in DL methods. For accelerated high-\nresolution imaging, which remains a focal point for our TRD, we will develop a new computational imaging\npipeline that explicitly combines interpretable denoising methods and physics-driven DL reconstruction. These\nwill be complemented by new technologies for improved denoising of MR image series, and for self-supervised\ntraining of physics-driven DL reconstruction from few examples without ground-truth data. On the acquisition\nside, we will concentrate on parallel transmit technology for UHF imaging. We will tackle issues related to the\nhigh computational complexity and sub-optimality of existing methods by proposing an unsupervised DL\napproach. We will then augment this strategy by incorporating hard constraints on maximum voltage, power\nand specific-absorption-rate into DL optimization. We will further investigate new classification-type strategies\nfor pulse selection towards calibration-free parallel transmit. Finally, we will also pursue developments for\nmulti-nuclei MRI and multi-modal neuroimaging. For the former, we will develop a physics-driven DL framework\nfor joint reconstruction of simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclei acquisitions, using signal intensity informed\nmulti-coil encoding operators and an additional cyclic loss term to ensure consistency across the different\nproton and x-nuclei resolutions. For the latter, we will adapt our interpretable motion-insensitive denoising\nstrategies to optical imaging, incorporating new forward operators and noise models, while decoupling motion\ncorrection from denoising.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nDrug overdose deaths continue to rise in the United States, accounting for over 100,000 deaths in 2021 alone.\nMethamphetamine and opioid co-use are largely fueling the most recent increase in mortality. In addition, co-\nuse associated hospital admissions increased more than five-fold between 2003 and 2015.\nPrevious research and hospital-based addiction services for substance use have focused on opioid use alone.\nThese addiction medicine services have increased rates of medication for opioid use disorder and improved\npatient linkage to continuing outpatient treatment. As a result, hospital length of stay and readmission rates\nhave decreased. However, past research indicates individuals with co-use have different sociodemographic\nand health profiles and are less likely to receive medication for opioid use disorder than individuals who use\nopioids alone. There is limited evidence of how existing hospital-based addiction services effect patients who\nco-use methamphetamine and opioids or how these services could be tailored to better treat hospitalized\npatients with co-use.\nThe overall objective of this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 fellowship is to generate evidence that can guide the\neventual development, implementation, and evaluation of hospital addiction medicine treatment services\ntailored to co-use. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to characterize patient demographics and\nhospitalization characteristics associated with co-use from a nationally representative sample of inpatient\nhospitalizations, 2) to quantify the risk of re-admission and mortality following hospital discharge, by substance\nuse profile, and whether differences vary by the receipt of hospital-based addiction services and 3) to identify\nbarriers and facilitators to providing hospital-based addiction services tailored for patients with co-use.\nThe proposed mixed methods project is based on a sequential explanatory approach. It includes training in\nboth quantitative (Aims 1 & 2) and qualitative (Aim 3) research methodologies. Through this work and a\nthoughtfully designed training plan, the trainee will achieve the following goals: 1) develop health services\nresearch expertise, 2) advance the substance use research field as it relates to polysubstance use, 3) integrate\nresearch, clinical, and advocacy activities in the field of addiction medicine. This supports his long-term goal of\nbridging health services research and clinical medicine to support patients with substance use disorders as a\nphysician-researcher.",

If successful, it could treat many thousands of patients who suffer from chronic\nvenous insufficiency in deep veins, untreatable with compression stockings, and the sequelae of\ndebilitating leg ulcers, as there is currently no FDA-approved prosthetic vein valve. This novel\nvein valve is created from a tissue grown from donor dermal fibroblasts directly on a nitinol stent\nfollowed by decellularization. We have shown in a recent publication that the resulting bileaflet\nvalve meets hydrodynamic performance criteria in vitro and regenerates with host cells,\nincluding endothelialization, without gross calcification, stenosis, or thickening of the leaflets\npost-delivery in the ovine iliac vein model based on initial testing.\n We propose here to make a key improvement upon the initial design and results by\nusing a stent that transitions from a circular section to an oval section, emulating vein valve\nsinuses to improve hemodynamics and mitigate leaflet fusion to the valve wall that currently\noccurs in vivo over time. In this milestone-driven plan, valve geometries will first be screened\nusing computational modeling of valve function and then characterized hydrodynamically.\nValves of 12 mm diameter enhanced with these sinuses will be delivered via catheter to the\novine iliac vein for up to 24-week duration with (R61 phase) and without (R33 phase) sustained\nanti-coagulation based on the rate of endothelialization. Delivery will be conducted in the normal\nanatomy and in a venous reflux model in sheep achieved by compromising the tricuspid valve\nsufficiently to ensure the valves are cycled in these quadrupeds. Longitudinal assessment of\nvalve function will be made via ultrasound and venogram. Harvested valve leaflets will be\nassessed for dimensions, tensile mechanical properties, cellularity and phenotype via\nimmunohistochemistry, and matrix composition via biochemical assay and histology.\n An INTERACT meeting will also be conducted during the R33 phase to ascertain GMP\nmanufacturing and GLP testing expectations of the FDA for a transcatheter vein valve,\nextending prior FDA interaction regarding the decellularized tissue that we create in vitro to\ninclude stent and valve testing in light of ISO standards that exist for transcatheter heart valves.\nOur Office of Technology Commercialization will also be engaged regarding patent protection\nbeyond the PCT filed and commercialization opportunities.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThis proposal for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) focuses on the training of Dr. PingHsun\nHsieh to become an independent investigator of large-scale genomics and human population genetics. Dr.\nHsieh is a population geneticist by training, and the proposed studies will advance his training into long-read-\nbased sequencing technologies and novel machine-learning approaches to study the fitness consequences of\nnew mutations, with a focus on structural variants (SVs), in humans and nonhuman primates. Another\nessential piece will be the development of resources on which types of new SVs are most likely to be\npathogenic and hence most worth further effort by medical researchers. The methods developed in this work\nwill enable other researchers to do more hypothesis-free analysis of SVs in disease etiology.\nSpecifically, the training program will center on the study of the distribution of fitness effects of new SVs in\nhuman and nonhuman primates using high-quality SV calls and genotypes from several large-scale long- and\nshort-read sequencing projects. The mentored work will take place under the supervision of the primary\nmentor, Dr. Evan Eichler, and the co-mentor, Dr. Sharon Browning, both at the University of Washington (UW).\nThe mentor and co-mentor are well-established experts in the characterization of genomic variations using\nhigh-throughput technologies and the development of stochastic modeling methods for large-scale genetic\ndata, respectively. Dr. Hsieh will also gain advice from a formal advisory committee as well as through\nactivities arranged by the Department of Genome Sciences (GS), which is an optimal place for the mentored\ntraining providing the candidate with access to outstanding scientists in areas including genetics of model\norganisms, disease, population genetics, and the development of high-throughput genomic technologies.\nWhile found in nature and yet generally deemed to be deleterious given their size, SVs can be beneficial, and\nthus, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new SVs (i.e., the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and\ndeleterious SVs) remains elusive. In the proposed studies, we will infer the DFE of new SVs and other variants\nto assess their relative importance in nature, which in turn helps prioritize variants (e.g., SVs vs. single-\nnucleotide variants [SNVs]) in medical genetics. Specifically, in the K99/R00 phases we will (1) infer the DFE\nof new SVs and SNVs using a diverse panel of ~100 long-read and ~4,000 short-read high-coverage\nhuman and nonhuman primate genomes; (2) compare the DFE of new mutations among primates using\ncontemporary and ancient DNA genomes; and (3) study the fitness effects and selective constraints on\ndiseases in different mutation categories in large cohorts of >20,000 genomes. The skills learned in this\nproposal are on the cutting-edge and are tailored for the candidate to amass a great amount of knowledge in\nnew areas of genomics, which will be applicable to many organisms and diseases and critical to the\ncandidate\u2019s future independent laboratory.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nOur goal is to establish a novel MRI approach to acquire functional MRI (fMRI) data simultaneously from brain\nand spinal cord. Unlike standard MRI readouts, our approach does not require a dedicated shimming procedure,\nas it is based on the newly developed zero echo time MRI pulse sequence entitled Multi-Band SWeep Imaging\nwith Fourier Transformation (MB-SWIFT) which is inherently resilient to magnetic field inhomogeneities.\nComprehensive evaluations of the central nervous system (CNS) function will tremendously benefit from this\nimaging modality, particularly in areas of research such as spinal cord injury, neurodegenerative diseases, pain\nand aging. Thus far, functional neuroimaging of the CNS has been an untapped area of research due to several\ntechnical challenges, the biggest of which is the need to efficiently shim a field of view large enough to cover\nboth brain and spinal cord. Solutions of per-slice dynamic shimming approaches have been proposed. However,\nthey are limited by the settling-time of eddy currents, they considerably prolong the experimental session, and\nthey have been applied only to cover cervical (but not lower) spinal cord. Furthermore, dynamic shimming allows\nonly inefficient sequential rather than simultaneous acquisitions of brain and spinal cord, posing additional\nchallenges for CNS fMRI. As proven by our preliminary data, MB-SWIFT can instead image two fields of view\n(FOVs) at distant locations in brain and lumbar spinal cord in a true simultaneous fashion (i.e., within 1 ms of\neach other), thus allowing unprecedented functional imaging of the CNS that is unattainable with standard\nimaging modalities for fMRI. The current project is a proof-of-concept study conducted in rats, designed to first\noptimize the MB-SWIFT protocol including the dual RF coil and the dual FOV acquisition, then to demonstrate\nthat fMRI of CNS with MB-SWIFT provides robust fMRI outcomes in absence of dedicated shimming solutions.\nMoreover, we will optimize spoke order of MB-SWIFT and post-processing pipeline for handling physiological\nnoise, and demonstrate that MB-SWIFT provides surrogate markers of neuronal activity in spinal cord. Finally\nwe will establish inter-subject, intra-subject and inter-site reproducibility of task-based and resting-state fMRI\noutcomes extracted from the CNS with dual FOV MB-SWIFT. Once completed, the study will provide an\ninvaluable tool for pre-clinical research, and will set the stage for translation to humans.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast\ncancers accounting for 75% of cases. Endocrine therapies directed at blocking ER action are highly effective;\nhowever, 40% of women with ER+ tumors develop resistance and progress to metastatic disease. ER+ tumors\nrelapse late, and tumor cells can remain quiescent for years to decades. Progress in the treatment of metastatic\nbreast cancer is limited by strategies that primarily target rapidly proliferating tumor cells. Contributing factors to\nadvanced disease progression include breast cancer stem cells (CSC), which are poorly proliferative and exist\nas minority populations in therapy resistant tumors. We identified SRC-3 (steroid receptor [SR] co-activator 3)\nas a novel cytoplasmic binding partner of PELP1. Similar to SRC-3, PELP1 is an ER co-activator, and\ndynamically shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm to act as a nuclear co-activator and cytoplasmic\nscaffolding protein for growth factor and steroid receptors. PELP1 is primarily nuclear in normal breast, but\nincreased cytoplasmic localization of PELP1 is an oncogenic event that promotes disease progression by\nunknown mechanisms. We showed PELP1/SRC-3 cytoplasmic complexes drive breast CSC phenotypes and\ngenes associated with pro-survival in ER+ breast cancer models. SRC-3 inhibition disrupts complex formation\nand cytoplasmic PELP1-induced tumorspheres. Top candidates identified from RNA-seq analysis include\nPFKFB family members, which are bi-functional kinase/phosphatases that have roles in cancer metabolism and\nCSC biology. PFKFB3/-4 co-purified with PELP1/SRC-3 complexes; inhibition of PFKFB3/-4 blocked\nPELP1/SRC-3 complex formation and biology. Remarkably, PELP1/SRC-3 CSC biology is phenocopied in\ntamoxifen-resistant (TamR) and paclitaxel-resistant (TaxR) models. Herein, we hypothesize that PELP1/SRC-3\ncomplexes amplify signaling inputs to PFKFB family members that mediate altered metabolic pathways required\nfor resistant ER+ tumor cell populations. We will: 1) identify signaling pathways essential for PELP1/SRC-3\ndriven therapy resistance using mass cytometry, and 2) determine the therapeutic benefits of targeting\nPELP1/SRC-3/PFKFB complexes in vivo to block cancer progression and metastasis. Our long-term objectives\nare to identify non-ER therapeutic targets that can be developed as combination strategies to eliminate therapy\nresistant tumor cells in ER+ breast cancer. During the K22 award, we expect to define the molecular links\nbetween cancer cell metabolism and oncogenic events in breast cancer progression, metastasis, and examine\nthe benefits of targeting this pathway to impair late recurrence. This proposal will provide a solid foundation for\nthe candidate\u2019s goal of moving towards translational cancer research during her transition to independence.\nDelineating the key players will fundamentally redefine standard care options to target therapy-resistant\npopulations in ER+ breast cancer.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nDrosophila melanogaster is one of the leading animal models for biomedical research, with researchers\ngenerating new lines of Drosophila every year for studies in numerous cancers, genetic disorders, and other\nmaladies. Currently there are greater than 160,000 Drosophila stocks held at different stock centers around the\nworld. As reliable and cost-effective approaches for long-term preservation of Drosophila stocks are lacking,\nindividual labs and stock centers must maintain their lines as living populations, which is resource-intensive and\nputs the stocks at risk of loss. In 2021, our group developed an easily implemented and robust cryopreservation\nprotocol for Drosophila melanogaster embryos which can be applied in any lab without the need for specialized\ninstruments. This protocol is broadly applicable, and it has been successfully used to preserve 25 distinct strains\nfrom different sources. For most strains, >50% of the embryos hatch and >25% of the resulting larvae develop\ninto fully functioning adults after cryopreservation and rewarming (normalized survival to control embryos),\nproviding sufficient numbers of adults to revive the strain. To accelerate the cryopreservation and archival of\ncritical Drosophila stocks, we will develop, standardize, and disseminate resources to individual labs and stock\ncenters. Significant efforts will be devoted to developing reliable methods for cryogenic storage and shipping of\nDrosophila embryos as well as to study if any significant mutagenic changes occur due to cryopreservation. We\nwill be working with multiple groups within the cryobiology and fly community to gather feedback on and refine\nour approach. With the collaboration of the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (BDSC), we will identify and\nprioritize the stocks that need cryopreservation to prevent their total loss in the event of a disaster or genetic\ndrift. We will also demonstrate the efficacy of our cryopreservation protocol on a large scale with a selected\ngroup of stocks identified by BDSC. Finally, we will also estimate the costs for cryopreservation in comparison\nto the traditional method of Drosophila maintenance to inform future efforts to protect these precious genetic\nresources. This is a multi-PI project led by investigators with significant experience in Drosophila genetics and\ncryobiology.",

Genomic advances pioneered to probe the cellular and molecular biology of other human tissues\nprovide powerful strategies to understand biological systems, but are underutilized in milk research.. It is time\nfor a new era of human milk research focused on deep interrogation of maternal mammary cell genomics, in\ninteraction with maternal clinical and behavioral factors, in shaping milk composition. Furthermore, the scope of\nnormal variation in milk composition is yet to be established. Outlining the scope of normative variation in milk\nis key to next-generation human milk fortification techniques to support the nutritional needs of preterm infants\nand other clinical populations of interest. The primary objective of the proposed project is to generate a\nsystems-level view of human milk in the context of healthy mothers and their term infants. As such, the\nproposed work is directly responsive to NIH/NICHD RFA-022-020, \u201cHuman Milk as a Biological System\u201d. The\nstudy leverages existing data, milk, and fecal specimens from a richly phenotyped cohort of 400 mother-infant\ndyads, and is based on compelling preliminary data identifying novel genetic sequence variation shaping milk\ngene expression, and relationships of milk metabolomic, lipidomic, and microbiomic variation to infant growth\nand cognition. Specific Aim 1: to identify maternal genetic and clinical factors that shape human milk gene\nexpression. We will identify novel genetic determinants of the milk transcriptome and assess potential\nmodification of these genetic associations by gestational weight gain, diet, and other clinical factors. Single-cell\nRNA-sequencing will provide additional necessary information for characterization of the cell type composition\nwithin human milk. Specific Aim 2: to describe key features of the normative human milk biosystem and their\ninteractions with one another. The project expands on existing milk omics data from the cohort, including milk\nmicrobiomes, oligosaccharides, metabolomics, and lipidomics, to be integrated with the genomic data\nproduced under Aim 1. Established and novel machine learning techniques will be used to characterize\ninteraction networks and correlational structures among these key features of human milk. Specific Aim 3: to\nestablish how the milk biosystem is related to variation in infant gut microbiomes and health. Milk multi-\u2018omic\nnetworks will be aligned with infant growth, body composition, and gut microbiome variation from birth to 6\nmonths in the 400 infant offspring from the above cohort. Statistical and machine learning techniques will\ndefine the scope of milk system variation consistent with normal infant growth and gut microbiome\ndevelopment. For a subset of 150 infants, we will also incorporate innovative early life cognitive assessments\nfor exploratory analyses. Finally, we will develop an online portal for visualizing the resulting data, enabling\nother researchers to investigate specific features and relationships of interest.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nIn the 50 years since the genetic counseling profession began, a systematic study of genetic counseling (GC)\nprocesses and outcomes in real-life sessions across specialties has never been conducted. In order to\noptimize GC quality and improve efficiency of care, the field must first be able to accurately and\ncomprehensively measure GC processes and determine which processes are most critical to achieve positive\npatient experiences and outcomes. The overarching objective of this study is to characterize GC processes\nusing a novel and pragmatic measure and to link variations in processes and session time to patient-reported\noutcomes using a rigorous approach to define quality, efficient GC in practice. The central hypothesis is that\nGC processes impact patient outcomes in complex ways and that by evaluating and linking processes with\noutcomes we can identify ways to optimize GC quality and efficiency. To test the central hypothesis and attain\nthe overall objective, a reliable, pragmatic checklist will be used to measure GC processes in audio recorded\nsessions and to characterize the extent and types of variability in GC processes across genetic counselors and\nspecialties using actual patient sessions of varying lengths. Surveys will measure patient experience,\nempowerment, activation, decisional and informational needs and information overload. Coincidence analysis\nwill be conducted to identify patterns of GC processes that consistently make a difference for high scores on\neach patient-reported measure. Comparison of the extent to which characteristics of GC sessions (including\ntime) influence variability in the processes used and variability in patient outcomes will be accomplished\nthrough random effects multilevel models. We will then test the effectiveness of a GC efficiency intervention\nthat tailors counseling to a patients\u2019 informational preferences and values assessments and removes select\nprocesses found not to contribute to differences in patient outcomes using a stepped-wedge randomized\ncontrolled study. The study will integrate perspectives from four community advisory boards and a genetic\ncounselor advisory board to provide vital input throughout the study process. This participatory approach was\nchosen to leverage diverse perspectives to create research that is feasible, acceptable, and usable beyond the\nresearch environment. The results of this study will be useful in considering which GC processes are essential\nfor optimizing various patient outcomes in minimal time for a diversity of patients. This study is expected to\nimprove measurement of GC processes, more clearly delineate differences in genetic counseling processes\nand patient reported outcomes, and increase genetic counseling efficiency by reducing in person visit times\nwhile maintaining or improving quality patient outcomes.",

In\nrecognition that the field of genetic counseling would benefit from additional research funding and that our\nresearch team is well poised to meet this need, we have created the first ever research fellowship for genetic\ncounselors called the Genetic Counseling Fellowship in Research Training (GC-FIRST) at the University of\nMinnesota. Upon completion of this comprehensive 2-year, part-time research education experience, four\ngenetic counselors will be exceptionally well positioned to contribute to the growing need for genetic\ncounseling researchers. The overarching objective of GC-FIRST is to train genetic counselors in a range of\nresearch methodologies to promote research implementation by genetic counselors working in clinical,\nindustry, public and population health settings. Our central goal is to educate genetic counseling researchers to\nbe independent leaders who mentor future genetic counseling researchers. To reach this goal and attain the\noverall objective, we will: 1) Develop a rigorous qualitative and quantitative training in the fundamentals and\nadvances in genetic counseling research through a series of formal coursework and training modules; 2)\nProvide interdisciplinary research training using a practical, application based, and collaborative approach to\nproduce two manuscripts and a grant application; 3) Generate a diverse cohort of well-trained research\nclinicians that will have enthusiasm for lifelong learning to bolster the genetic counseling research workforce; 4)\nEvaluate the short term and long term summative and formative outcomes of the two-year fellowship. If\nsuccessful, this application would create the first research training fellowship program for genetic counselors\nand contribute to the workforce in academic, clinical, industry, public and population health settings. An added\nend-product of the fellowship will be the creating and distribution of a set of online modules that will be\npackaged to educate an even greater number of genetic counselors with advanced research training.",

    "abstract_text": "At present there are more than 25,000 patients waiting to receive liver transplants. The number is increasing due\nto an aging US population accompanied by an increasing incidence of chronic liver diseases associated with\nsuch disorders as alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis, MAFLD and NASH. In spite of efforts to persuade people to\nserve as organ donors, the demand increasingly outstrips the supply for organ transplantation. One solution to\nthis problem is the ability to generate human livers in animals for liver as well as hepatocyte transplantation.\nAlthough there are numerous protocols to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and inducible\npluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) ex vivo to a variety of cell types, they have encountered significant challenges in\ntranslation to the clinic. However, it is now possible to regenerate the replica of organs/cells from one species of\nanimal within the body of a second species. This involves the knockout (KO) of specific developmental genes in\nthe blastocyst of species two; and the intra-blastocyst injection of pluripotent stem cells from species one to\ngenerate offspring that carry organs/cell types derived from that donor. The translation of this approach requires\nan efficient gene-editing technology. In fact, novel TALEN/CRISPR/Cas9 technologies provide such a rapid, and\ncost-effective means to generate genetically modified animals. Accordingly, we propose to employ gene-editing\ntechnology to knockout specific genes associated with liver development in the mouse embryo. We hypothesize\nthat rat liver can be generated in the mouse by the injection of rat ESCs or PSCs into CRISPR-genetically\nengineered murine blastocysts and transplanted back into syngeneic rats. The studies represent a first step of\ninterspecies development of exogenic organs for transplantation without immunosuppression. We have\ndesigned three Specific Aims to test our central hypothesis. Specifically, we will characterize (1) intra- and\ninterspecies exogenic liver and endothelium derived from HHEX KO embryos; (2) the immunology and function\nof interspecies exogenic liver and endothelial development derived from HHEX KO embryos; and (3) several\napproaches to enhance the generation of interspecies chimeras that include humanization of morphogen ligand-\nreceptor interactions. The resulting exogenic rat liver and endothelium will be transplanted back into syngeneic\nrats to evaluate graft survival and functionality. The generation of whole livers that are comprised primarily of rat\nhepatic and endothelial cells derived from implanted rat ESCs or PSCs would represent a paradigm shift and\nprovide the necessary preclinical evidence for ultimately creating human livers in animals. If successful, the\nproposed research would be a game-changer that could conceivably pave the way for an alternate source of\nhuman livers for organ and/or hepatocyte transplantation that is tailored to specific patients. In addition, this\nnovel, albeit somewhat high-risk approach circumvents many of the problems associated with research on\nxenotransplantation. The potential impact on improved health care in the U.S. and worldwide for liver diseases\nis great and represents a major step towards the goal of individualized medicine.",

    "abstract_text": "Ethyl alcohol (henceforth ethanol) is a human carcinogen.1,2 Its consumption has been associated with cancers\nat various sites, including the oral cavity. Despite strong epidemiological evidence, the mechanisms of ethanol\ncarcinogenicity remain unclear, hampering the ability to develop efficacious preventive strategies, identify\nindividual susceptibility, and effectively face the challenges deriving from the projected increase in consumption.\nEthanol major metabolite, acetaldehyde (AA), is suggested to play a crucial role in head and neck cancers by\nreacting with DNA. These reactions generate chemical modifications (DNA adducts) that, if not repaired, may\nresult in mutations and ultimately lead to cancer. Individuals with genetic deficiencies in ALDH2, the enzyme\nresponsible for AA detoxification, were shown to have a 15% increased risk of developing oral cancer when\ndrinking.5 Additionally, Fanconi Anemia (FA) patients, who have impaired mechanisms to repair AA-related DNA\ndamage, have an average 500-fold higher chance of developing oral cancer.6 Previous studies have shown a\ndirect and dose-dependent connection between ethanol consumed and AA-derived DNA damage, in the oral\ncavity of healthy volunteers.7 This effect was not as evident in blood DNA from the same individuals, indicating\na distinct contribution of AA exposure coming from oral ethanol metabolism by the mucosa and oral microbiome.\nOur hypothesis is that AA resulting from oral metabolism of ethanol is playing a crucial role in oral cancer\nthrough the formation of DNA adducts, and that levels and persistence of driver adducts will increase in\nindividuals with increasing oral cancer risk. Using cutting-edge analytical approaches, our objective is to\ncharacterize ethanol's oral metabolism and its corresponding DNA damage and mutational profiles, to develop\na systematic assembly of biomarkers for identifying oral cancer risk and for developing strategies for early\ndetection and prevention. This will be done by completing 3 aims. The first one will characterize DNA damage\nprofiles in oral cells, collected after exposure to a controlled alcohol dose from participants from 3 groups at\nincreasing risk of AA-related oral cancer (active ALDH2*1/1* homozygotes, inactive ALDH2*1/2* heterozygotes\nand FA patients). Driver adducts will be identified as those increasing in the groups following the increased\ncancer risk and persisting over time in FA patients. The second aim will focus on investigating the role of the oral\nmicrobiome in ethanol metabolism, by characterizing the oral microflora and measuring the aldehyde profile\nresulting from the ethanol dose in the saliva of study participants. Additionally, the oral microbiome will be\ncharacterized in samples from non-drinkers, included to investigate if ethanol consumption results in a specific\nprofile. Finally, the third aim will analyze genome-scale mutational signatures in oral cell lines exposed to AA, for\nwhich DNA adducts will be profiled, and in oral tumor tissues from rats chronically exposed to AA or ethanol.\nThis will yield mechanistic evidence on ethanol-related oral mutagenesis and cancer formation and identify DNA\nadducts bearing mutagenic potential.",

These goals encompass major Specific Aims that have significant \nsynergy: 1) Characterize the harmful effects of tobacco chemicals and products and develop biomarkers for \ncancer risk stratification in clinical and epidemiological studies; 2) Understand the landscape of exposures and \nbiochemical pathways leading to cancer to identify tools for cancer susceptibility assessment, prevention, and \ntreatment; and 3) Identify food products, as well as natural and synthetic chemicals, that reduce cancer risk. \nThe CC Program is led by Lisa Peterson, PhD, and Frank Ondrey, MD, PhD, FACS, who have complementary \nexperience that provides strong and synergistic leadership, and has 22 members from 15 departments across \n8 colleges, schools, and institutes at the University of Minnesota. The CC Program is highly productive, as \nevidenced by the number (523) of intra- (21%) and interprogrammatic (28%) as well as interinstitutional (70%) \npublications and cancer-relevant grant funding ($7.2M). A crosscutting theme of the Program is biomarker \ndevelopment to generate tools to identify at-risk individuals and support targeted prevention or therapeutic \napproaches. Furthermore, the Program\u2019s research tackles all the cancers with elevated risk in Minnesota such \nas melanoma, breast, corpus uteri, blood (leukemia and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma), and bladder cancer as well \nas other cancers highly prevalent in the state. The Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) provides many benefits to \nthe CC Program including Shared Resources (particularly Analytical Biochemistry, Biostatistics, Cancer \nGenomics, and Comparative Pathology); pilot funding; and funds for retreats, seminars, conferences, and \nother meetings. Translation of our basic research findings has been facilitated by active involvement of \nProgram members in 8 Translational Working Groups. All of these activities have helped enhance the \ninteractions among Program members as well as with individuals from other Programs and institutions. The \nfuture directions and goals of the Program fit well within all 4 pillars of MCC\u2019s Strategic Plan. Recently obtained \nfunding engages the Minnesota community and care providers with the goal of accelerating the path to cancer \nprevention and cures, particularly for lung, head and neck, blood and prostate cancers. In addition, we will \nbuild on the success of the 10,000 Family Study by partnering with members of the SPECS Program and \nCommunity Outreach and Engagement to expand our work linking environmental exposures to cancers of \nconcern to Minnesotans.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an alarming impact on already unacceptably high childhood obesity rates,\nand emerging evidence shows that traditional approaches to pediatric weight management have been\nmarkedly less effective since the onset of the pandemic. As obesity during childhood is much more likely to be\nsustained during adulthood, and children with obesity and other chronic conditions are more likely to have\nsevere forms of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, this alarming increase in childhood obesity rates is poised\nto have a broad and long-term impact on population health unless effective interventions are implemented. Yet,\nwe know very little about the unique drivers of this dramatic increase in childhood obesity and whether BMI\nincreases will persist and become lifelong. We know even less about the protective factors that mitigate this\nrisk, as some youth will not develop obesity/worsening cardiometabolic health or may recover quickly despite\nrisk exposures. Our goals are to uncover the biobehavioral pathways through which pandemic-related\nstressors drive childhood obesity and cardiometabolic risk, and to identify protective factors and intervention\ntargets to mitigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on children\u2019s health. The proposed research offers a\nunique, time-sensitive opportunity to prospectively examine the impact of multilevel stressors brought on by the\npandemic to identify factors influencing BMI and cardiometabolic health trajectories. We will leverage an\nestablished longitudinal cohort of racially/ethnically diverse children (60% Latino) from predominantly low-\nincome households, who were enrolled at 2-4 years of age (U01HD068890) and followed annually through\nages 7-11 (R01HD090059). Underscoring the timeliness, uniqueness, and significance of this cohort, body\ncomposition, cardiovascular and metabolic functioning, neuroendocrine, oxidative stress, and inflammatory\nbiomarkers, and health behaviors were obtained just prior to the onset of the pandemic (n=338). Drawing on a\nrich history of longitudinal data over 5 previous timepoints including immediately prior to the pandemic, we\npropose to add two new waves of data collection (7- and 8-years after inception of the cohort, 2-3 years post-\nonset of the pandemic) when children will be 10-14 years of age, an important developmental window of\nobesity and cardiometabolic imprinting. Multiple levels of pandemic-related stressors will be measured,\nalongside gold standard biological measures of stress activation, adiposity and cardiometabolic health,\nobjective health behavior measures, and parent-child surveys. Our specific aims focus on identifying the\npathways, parent-child factors, and neighborhood/community contexts needed to guide effective childhood\nobesity interventions in the aftermath of the pandemic and reduce adverse health consequences among\nvulnerable and understudied populations.",

However, propagation of otopathology research has been\nhampered by barriers that affect every step of the research chain (procurement, processing, distribution, and\ndissemination). The major goals of this project are to propagate the use of human temporal bones for research\nand training through the establishment of our lab as national resource for temporal bone expertise and to become\npart of the collaborative network to be established by the NIDCD to serve the auditory and vestibular research\ncommunities. These goals will be achieved through 4 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will establish a core\nservice for processing and distribution of high-quality temporal bone tissue. We will leverage our high\nprocurement capacity, digitization of our collection, and technical experience to implement a structured approach\nfor prioritizing and processing human temporal bones that are of special scientific interest to meet research\nneeds of the scientific community. In Specific Aim 2, we will optimize human temporal bone preparation\ntechniques to reduce processing costs and time and improve the capacity to retain, preserve, and extract proteins\nand DNA/RNA. We will investigate technologies for improving the speed and quality achieved during fixation,\nembedding, decalcification, sectioning, and visualization. In Specific Aim 3, we will provide technical instruction\non the processing and use of human temporal bones for the scientific and clinical communities. Innovative hybrid\neducational modules will be employed, and all materials, training, and protocols will be freely disseminated to\nincrease the number of well-trained technicians and researchers. In Specific Aim 4, we will provide outreach to\nthe scientific and clinical communities to disseminate and promote the use of human temporal bones in research.\nThis will be achieved in-person at major scientific meetings and virtually using multiple multimedia resources.\nOur multidisciplinary team of experienced investigators has the necessary knowledge and skills aligned with\nample resources (large archival collection, high procurement capacity of high-quality temporal bones, highly\nskilled team of technicians, internal distribution services to send biological specimens), collaborations with\ncenters of excellence for imaging and tissue processing, and innovative educational and audiovisual services to\nprovide the necessary means to propagate and take temporal bone research to the next level.",

Implantable neural stimulators have many parameters, such as stimulation amplitude, frequency and pulse width, which could potentially be tuned to improve efficacy. However, there is no systematic process to guide epileptologists through optimization. Stimulation of ANT in animal models has shown almost immediate changes in excitability in the loop of Papez, which we hypothesize is a biomarker that could be used to optimize stimulation parameters. Medtronic\u2019s DBS Percept system allows for recording during stimulation and streaming the data to a computer for further analysis, which can be used in an optimization loop. Bayesian optimization (BayesOpt) is a machine learning algorithm that is widely used for efficient optimization over a bounded parameter range when acquiring data is expensive and computational time is relatively cheap. We have used BayesOpt for optimizing stimulation settings in animal models and clinical trials. Here we propose to develop an optimization platform where stimulation settings are programmed by a physician using recommended settings from a BayesOpt algorithm to minimize power measured from the patient\u2019s thalamus in the clinic using Percept. Three aims are proposed to develop, test, and validate this approach in an exploratory clinical trial. Aim 1: Develop and test BayesOpt clinical interface with hardware in the loop system. Aim 2: Apply BayesOpt to 20 epilepsy patients treated with the Percept system in a clinical setting to optimize stimulation settings to minimize thalamic activity. Aim 3: Validate optimized settings at home by programming patients with optimized setting and their physician selected setting to test if seizure frequency or power spectral density is significantly lower in the optimized setting. The outcome of this clinical trial will be to establish safety and feasibility of optimization and validation. If successful, this study will be used to power a phase II efficacy trial. The broader impact of this work is that this platform could be used to tune the Percept system, based on different biomarkers, in other diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, pain, and depression.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a sudden catastrophic loss of the pulse, continues to be a major public health\nissue. A proportion of SCA events occur in persons engaging in drug use and given that drug overdose\ndeaths are at unprecedented levels in the United States, the epidemiology of drug related SCA is changing\nrapidly. Recognition and characterization of drug related SCA events is critical for accurate estimates of\nmortality associated with drug use, and to inform public health measures, especially in the context of the\nongoing opioid epidemic. This proposed study will address several of the major knowledge gaps. This K01\nCareer Development Award leverages the existing infrastructure and clinical data archive of two ongoing\nprospective community-based studies of SCA. Dr. Norby will use this data to examine the epidemiology of\nSCA associated with drug use, with the overall goal of improving community-based approaches to SCA\nprevention. This proposal aims to 1) identify opportunities that will improve survival from SCA in the\nsetting of drug use, and 2) identify substrate-trigger factors that initiate SCA in the presence of drug use.\nTaken together, these aims will interface community-based surveillance and comprehensive investigative\nreports to fill in the epidemiology and research gaps in SCA events related to substance use. To address\nthese research aims, Dr. Norby will assemble records and reports in these two communities for SCA cases\nthat have previously been excluded due to evidence of drug use. The overall goal of this K01 is to inform\na sequence of R series grants to further investigate the prediction and prevention of SCA, and to improve\nsurvival after an SCA event related to drug use. With the support of this K01 award, Dr. Norby will be able\nto pursue this goal and transition to independent investigator status through essential training and\nmentorship. She will gain advanced training in 1) combining multimodal health records across systems\nand extracting pertinent information; 2) pharmacoepi drug use research and analysis of drug-drug\ncombination; and 3) SCA mechanisms, SCA response and care, and additionally gain familiarity with\ntoxicology and autopsy reports. Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute provides the ideal infrastructure to\ncomplete the research and training activities. Through the proposed research, training, and career\ndevelopment Dr. Norby will gain the scientific and professional skills necessary to become a successful\nindependent investigator and lead a research program that advances the field of SCA associated with drug\nuse.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nRecently, NCI called for research to effectively study small or rare populations relevant to cancer research.\nSexual and gender minorities (SGM) are small populations at disproportionate risk for cancer but who have\nbeen under-researched in cancer studies. The principal challenge common across lesbian, gay, bisexual, and\ntransgender populations is to develop effective methods to identify and recruit patients and survivors who are\nSGM into NCI cancer studies. Two technical advances have transformative potential to advance research on\nhealth disparities in SGM cancer patients. First, online recruitment has yielded large SGM samples in other\nareas of research (e.g., HIV primary prevention), but using online methods to recruit SGM cancer patients has\nnot been rigorously studied. Second, cancer clinics have begun to include sexual orientation and gender\nidentity (SOGI) data in the electronic medical record, but we need to test protocols on how to recruit SGM\ncancer patients using this data source. This application is based upon our recent success in overcoming\nchallenges to recruit over 400 gay and bisexual prostate cancer patients into an R01 intervention trial of\ntailored rehabilitation for this population. We will replicate and expand upon these clinic-based and online\nmethods to study how to recruit three small SGM populations \u2013 (1) sexual minority cisgender men, (2) sexual\nminority cisgender women, and (3) transgender and gender non-binary cancer patients - into cancer research\nstudies. We have three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will document, in depth, SGM\u2019s attitudes towards\nparticipating in NIH cancer research, identifying the facilitators and barriers that each group reports influences\ntheir willingness to participate. We will also investigate any impact poor cancer care and discrimination has on\nresearch participation. We will investigate these in cisgender SM men, cisgender SM women and gender\nminority cancer patients (n=15 per group) and compare experiences within these small populations and\nbetween SGM and a cisgender, heterosexual patient comparison group. In Aim 2, we will test the\neffectiveness, efficiency, cost, and workload in using two clinic SOGI-based strategies and three online\nstrategies to recruit SGM small populations (150 each) compared to recruiting a sample of cisgender,\nheterosexual cancer patients. We predict size of the small population will negatively correlate with work, cost,\nand time involved, but positively correlate with yield. In Aim 3, we will conduct an online quantitative survey of\nwillingness to participate in cancer research with 450 SGM cancer patients (150 per group) versus a cisgender\nheterosexual group (150 men and 150 women). Key measures assess facilitators and barriers to participation\nin NIH cancer research. To advance measures, we will assess performance of each group on five validated\ncancer scales to compare cancer care experience, discrimination in treatment, and outcomes. Finally, we will\nintegrate and triangulate findings and assess intersectionality with race/ethnicity. This study will establish what\nrecruitment strategies are effective across SGM populations, and which may be specific to each subgroup.",

This study is sited in Tanzania (Tz), a socially conservative, highly religious country where\n34% of the population are Muslim. There are 13 health universities in Tz: 5 secular, 6 Christian-affiliated and 2\nMuslim-affiliated. In our Training for Health Professionals RCT (N=412 students), the medical, nursing and\nmidwifery students who received our comprehensive sexual health curriculum had moderate-to-large increases\nin sexual health knowledge, improved attitudes, and improved clinical skills compared to controls. Reflecting\nnational statistics, 92% of students rated themselves \u201cmoderately\u201d to \u201cextremely\u201d religious. Effects did not differ\nby discipline or demographics, but in secondary analyses, two religious differences were noted. Students who\nwere Muslim showed a smaller increase in confidence in their sexual health knowledge scores than Christian\nstudents (\u03b2=-21.01, SE=6.53, p=.001). And while students agreed or strongly agreed that the curriculum was\nrespectful across several demographics (97%), and sexual values (85%), the lowest acceptability ratings were\nfor \u201creligion and religious background\u201d (70.3%). These analyses were exploratory as our study was not\npowered to detect religious differences and only 14.3% participants were Muslims. In our renewal award, in\nAim 2, we are developing a train-the-trainer curriculum then will pilot the training to faculty at two other health\nuniversities: University of Dodoma (UDOM) and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical College (KCMUC), both\nChristian majority student bodies. In Aim 3, we will conduct a Phase IV trial at both sites with 3-, 6-, and 12-\nmonth follow-up. This supplement is to bring in sexual health experts who are Muslim to advise our curriculum\nand to add a third site. After the State University of Zanzibar (SUZA) learned about our study, they expressed\ninterest in being involved. SUZA is a secular health university with majority Muslim students. Adding SUZA as\na site will increase the likelihood for our project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on science and health.\nEthically, highly religious students are likely to be the students most in need of sexual health education. Adding\na Muslim majority site will increase our power to study effects by religious affiliation and religiosity. Showing\nthis curriculum was acceptable to Muslim students and increased their knowledge, attitudes, and clinical skills\nwill inform generalizability and has high potential to decrease religious objections to the curriculum. This in turn\nwill increase the likelihood of wide adoption of this curriculum in Muslim countries and across LMICs where\nMuslim-affiliated universities provide significant health student training.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY:\nTraining of health professionals in sexual health care is critical to address a broad array of a nation\u2019s sexual\nand reproductive health concerns. Research evaluating the effects of sexual health curricula on provider\nbehavior is rare. In sub-Saharan Africa, an environment with the world\u2019s highest rates of HIV, STIs, and\nmultiple sexual and reproductive health challenges, training of health students in sexual health care is almost\nnon-existent. Consequently, a rigorous study of its effects is needed if such education is to be widely adopted.\nIn our \u201cTraining for Health Professionals\u201d (THP-1) study, at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences\n(MUHAS) in Tanzania, we conducted formative research to identify the most common sexual health concerns.\nWe then tailored a sexual health curriculum training for healthcare providers to the African context and\nconducted the world\u2019s first single-blind, randomized controlled trial of its effects. Participants were 412 nursing,\nmidwifery, and medical students at MUHAS. Post-test evaluations with the intervention arm showed the\ncurriculum to be highly acceptable, culturally appropriate, needed, and feasible. At 3-month follow-up, as\ncompared to controls, intervention arm students had moderate-to-large increases in sexual health knowledge,\nimproved attitudes, and improved clinical skills. As required in a renewal application (THP-2), our long-term\nobjective remains \u201cto improve the sexual health outcomes for individuals in Tanzania by building the sexual\nand reproductive healthcare delivery skills of the health workforce.\u201d We have three new specific aims. Aim 1\nwill assess the medium and long-term effectiveness of an African-centric, sexual health curriculum. We will\nconduct a single-blinded RCT of the curriculum against a waitlist control arm, to assess the effects on sexual\nhealth knowledge, attitudes, and counseling skills at 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up (n=155 students per arm;\n310 in total). In Aim 2, we will develop a train-the-trainer curriculum. We will conduct a training needs\nassessment of faculty at the ten other health universities in Tanzania, develop training materials, and pilot the\ntraining to faculty at two other health universities: University of Dodoma (UDOM) and Kilimanjaro Christian\nMedical College (KCMC).

In a highly diverse metropolitan area\nactively confronting racism and disparities, Minn-KPMP will engage a diverse patient population to evaluate and\naddress barriers to enrollment in KPMP and to elicit the perspectives of our local participants on ethical issues\nposed by the KPMP, such as return of results and biobank governance. This will add significantly to KPMP\ncommunity engagement and ethics.\nLeveraging the Biomedical Informatics and Data Access service of the University of Minnesota Clinical and\nTranslational Science Institute (CTSI) Best Practices Integrated Informatics Core (BPIC), we will interrogate the\nlarge MHealth Fairview (MHealth) database to identify, recruit, enroll, and obtain clinical data, biosamples, and\nkidney biopsies from patients with CKD-Diabetes and CKD-Hypertension and resilient-T1D. We will work closely\nwith KPMP and help to refine and follow common study protocols while following maximum safety precautions.\nThe long-standing successful track record of our group in recruiting patients into clinical trials of CKD, and our\nethically rigorous approach to consenting for kidney biopsy and strict adherence to KPMP safety measures will\nensure our meaningful contribution to the KPMP mission and goals.\nMinn-KPMP has assembled an outstanding team of investigators and consultants to recruit and follow\nparticipants with CKD and with resilient T1D (Res-T1D). Directly relevant to this application, the Minn-KPMP\nstudy team has a long-standing track record of successfully recruiting, following-up, and safely and ethically\nperforming research kidney biopsies, including sequential kidney biopsies, in a wide range of participants,\nincluding participants with diabetes and with no clinical manifestations of CKD, siblings with diabetes, kidney\ndonors, kidney transplant recipients, and pancreas transplant recipients. Obtaining high quality biosamples,\nincluding kidney biopsy samples, from well phenotyped study participants is key to KPMP success, so that these\ntissues can be used for transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses.

There are no robust chemoprevention drugs or other treatments for high\nrisk oral precancerous conditions or field carcinogenesis despite 40 years of clinical trial research. High\nrisk oral precancerous conditions (such as leukoplakia) represent a standard target for chemoprevention\ninterventions. Type II anti-diabetic agents, including pioglitazone and metformin, are promising cancer\nprevention drugs for oral cavity preneoplasia that we have used in NCI sponsored clinical trials. They\nhave adequate safety and moderate efficacy in human trials, however, individually are likely not sufficient\nto advance to large scale clinical trials. These agents have differing mechanisms of action which each\nattack different events in oral carcinogenesis. In this project, we propose to conduct a phase IIa 12 week\nclinical trial with combination BID pioglitazone-metformin (15mg-500mg) in oral preneoplasia patients.\nWe have assembled a consortium of clinics in Minneapolis/St. Paul MN for efficient accrual to this trial.\nWe will examine pharmacodynamic endpoints in specimens based on both the mechanisms of the\nagents and how they may affect T cell subsets before and after treatment. Further, we will also analyze\nleukoplakia specimens and adjacent normal mucosa specimens by RNA-Seq before and after treatment,\nwhich will shed light on effects of the drugs as well as any putative \u201coff target\u201d effects. At the completion\nof this project, we will have a better understanding of pioglitazone and metformin effects on oral\ncarcinogenesis, as well as, an early stage clinical trial which could be expanded to larger randomized\ntrials with a promising cancer prevention strategy for oral preneoplasia or other tobacco-associated\nmalignancies.",

Animal and human studies suggest that early\nexposure to adversity may negatively impact developing biological systems altering long term\nstructural and functional trajectories, and accelerating aging processes. The proposed research\nwill examine this neurotoxicity hypothesis in relation to brain neurobiology (structure, function,\nconnectivity) and related cognitive and epigenetic markers sensitive to adversity and aging. The\nresearch will also examine the role of protective social relationships (especially positive early\ncaregiving) in moderating the adversity-related effects.\n Based in the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation (Sroufe et al., 2005) and\ndrawing on methodology from the Human Connectome Project in Aging (HCP-A; Bookheimer et\nal., 2019), the study addresses significant gaps in both neurobiological and behavioral\ninvestigations of the origins of adult aging processes and the effects of adversity on\ndevelopment. Unlike concurrent and retrospective studies of risk and protective influences on\naging, the proposed study employs a prospective multilevel design with a sample of individuals\nassessed from birth to middle adulthood. The proposed assessments of neurobiological and\ncognitive functioning will contribute to an understanding of the impact of exposure to adversity\non adult brain health (structure, function, connectivity) and age-related cognition. Specifically,\nwe will examine the timing and chronicity (onset and trajectory) of adversity in relation to adult\noutcomes. Genetic data will permit analyses of associations between adversity, epigenetic\nvariation (i.e., telomere length, DNA methylation age), and concurrent neural and cognitive\nfunctioning. The proposed work will address critical research, policy, and practice questions\nregarding the effects of adverse experience on the human brain, the cognitive and\nbiological correlates of neurobiological change, and the potential moderating influence of\nearly caregiving experience on these relations, generating testable research hypotheses\nand contributing to the development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts.",

Their functional impairment leads\nto severe neurological and metabolic pathologies stemming from disrupted phospholipid and fatty acid\nmetabolism, including X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), both the most common leukodystrophy and most\ncommon peroxisomal disorder that is caused by mutations in ABCD1 and for which no cure exists, and bile acid\nsynthesis defects and liver disease stemming from impaired ABCD3 function. While additional roles for ABCD\ntransporters in a wider array of disease pathways continue to be uncovered, the underlying mechanisms\ngoverning their substrate recognition, transport, and transport regulation remain poorly understood. The long-\nterm objectives of this project are to gain insight into peroxisomal ABCD transporter function and regulation in\nmolecular detail. We will use a combination of biochemical and cell biological tools, high resolution structural\nanalysis by cryo-electron microscopy, and continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR)\nspectroscopy to reveal the functionally relevant structural features and conformational states used by ABCD\ntransporters in fatty acid translocation, how they may be altered by ABCD1 mutation in X-ALD, and how ABCD1\nis mechanistically distinct from ABCD2 and ABCD3 despite their functional overlap. Specific Aim 1 deals with\nthe development and utilization of in vitro assays for determining substrate specificity profiles and transport\nproperties of ABCD1, ABCD2, and ABCD3. Specific Aim 2 deals with obtaining high resolution structural\ninformation of ABCD1, ABCD2, and ABCD3 in functionally relevant states in a physiological lipid environment\nthrough cryo-EM analysis. Specific Aim 3 deals obtaining information on the structural dynamics of ABCD1\nthrough CW-EPR studies. Our results will provide fundamental insights into peroxisomal ABC transporter\nfunctioning that can be exploited for ABCD1 targeted diagnostic and therapeutic tools to improve X-ALD patient\noutcomes, provide a framework for the design and development of chemical probes to study ABCD family\nfunction, and generate reliable in vitro and in silico tools to accelerate drug development/discovery efforts\ntargeting them.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a well-established role in regulating blood pressure in the periphery.\nACE is also expressed in the brain, with high levels in the striatonigral pathway formed by medium spiny\nprojection neurons that express the Drd1 dopamine receptor (D1-MSNs). We have found that ACE degrades an\nunconventional enkephalin heptapeptide, Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (MERF), in the nucleus accumbens of mice.\nCaptopril, a prototypical ACE inhibitor used to manage hypertension, enhances extracellular levels of MERF in\nthe nucleus accumbens. The resulting enhancement of mu opioid receptor activation by MERF causes a cell\ntype-specific long-term depression of glutamate release onto D1-MSNs. This mechanism of action has great\ntherapeutic potential, as our preliminary data indicate the decrease in excitatory drive to D1-MSNs can diminish\nthe rewarding effects of fentanyl. However, neither captopril nor modern ACE inhibitors routinely used in the\nclinic have been optimized to regulate endogenous opioid signaling. For example, MERF may be specifically\ndegraded by the catalytic N-domain of ACE, whereas most clinically-approved ACE inhibitors have greater\nselectivity for the catalytic C-domain of ACE. There is thus a need to identify optimal chemical entities that inhibit\nMERF degradation by ACE in brain tissue. The goal of this project is to identify new compounds that inhibit ACE\nand regulate endogenous opioid signaling in the nucleus accumbens. In AIM 1, we will screen a selected\nlibrary of ~2,000 small molecules for domain-selective inhibition of recombinant ACE protein. This will\ninclude candidate molecules drawn from rationally selected libraries using a pharmacophore-based approach,\nas well as molecules with diverse chemical scaffolds identified through a virtual screen. In AIM 2, we will\nvalidate the domain selectivity and efficacy of lead compounds on MERF degradation in nucleus\naccumbens tissue. This will include direct measurement of extracellular MERF using liquid chromatography-\ntandem mass spectrometry, as well as whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to measure functional effects on\nexcitatory input to D1-MSNs. These experiments will include knockout mice to test the necessity of each catalytic\ndomain of ACE in MERF degradation, as well as the involvement of mu opioid receptor signaling in physiological\nchanges. In AIM 3, we will evaluate the ability of lead compounds to attenuate fentanyl reward and\nreinforcement. This will include measurement of fentanyl-conditioned place preference and intravenous self-\nadministration of fentanyl. At the conclusion of these experiments, we expect to identify chemical motifs that may\nserve as leads to generate novel ACE inhibitors that block MERF degradation in the nucleus accumbens. We\nmay observe a double-dissociation between catalytic domains of ACE that degrade angiotensin (C-domain) and\nMERF (N-domain), raising the exciting possibility of selectively manipulating endogenous opioid signaling in the\nbrain while avoiding cardiovascular side-effects in the periphery. Our results may also reveal that central ACE\ninhibition can boost endogenous opioid signaling for clinical benefit, while mitigating risk of abuse/addiction.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nFacioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), is one of the most prevalent neuromuscular genetic\ndisorders, and it is caused by a loss of epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 repeats at chromosome 4 that then\nleads to loss of silencing of DUX4. One of the most mysterious aspects of FSHD is the timing and the extent of\nthe DUX4 expression. Levels of DUX4 in the affected muscles are either extremely low and/or transient as\nattempts to date have failed to detect the protein in situ. Evidence of DUX4 expression is indirect, based on\nelevated DUX4 target genes in MRI-guided biopsies from FSHD patients. We developed an FSHD mouse model\n(iDUX4pA;HSA) that allows conditional expression of DUX4 in muscle fibers, and which upon low level long-term\nexpression shows hallmarks of FSHD disease pathology. Because it is inducible and reversible, the\niDUX4pA;HSA mouse model provides a unique opportunity for exploring the hypothesis that DUX4 is only\nrequired to prime muscle for later pathology. Our initial experiments indicate that transient DUX4 expression is\nsufficient to induce long-term abnormalities in muscle tissue including an increased frequency of FAPs, an\nexcess of the fibrotic extracellular matrix, and the inability of the muscle to completely recover after injury. The\nresearch proposed in this application aims to explore the long-lasting effect of transient DUX4 expression on\nmuscle physiology and histology, cellular alterations, and epigenetic state of the genome in the muscle of FSHD\nmouse models. They will test the hypothesis that the echo of DUX4 expression, independent of DUX4 expression\nitself, can contribute to muscle pathology.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nA social gradient in health and aging is well established in humans; the greater the social connectedness and\nsocioeconomic status (SES), the lower the burden of a plethora of diseases and mortality rate. Consistently, lack\nof social support and low SES are among the major negative determinants of health, increasing the prevalence\nand/or anticipating the onset of diseases. Unfortunately, diseases often only manifest at old age when\ntherapeutic options and biological flexibility are limited. Additionally, the causal role of social context on aging is\ndifficult to ascertain, requiring an experimental design in which social factors can be randomized to infer\ncausation, which is unethical and often not feasible in humans. The evolutionary conserved role of social\ndeterminants of health and aging (SDoHA) and the ability to conduct randomized experimental designs in social\nmammals, offer the opportunity to reverse-translate observations made in humans to other animals. In particular,\nthe use of laboratory mice has several advantages to study the effect of social factors on aging, including: their\ncomparatively short lifespan when compared to other mammals enabling the completion of longevity studies in\na reasonable timeframe; the ability to conduct intent-to-treat randomization designs of socio-behavioral variables;\nthey are amenable to sophisticated genetic manipulations. However, the role of SDoHA is often neglected in\nbiomedical aging research using mice, thus missing critical components of human aging. The objectives of this\nproject are to: (i) develop rigorous socio-behavioral models suitable for aging studies in male and female mice;\n(ii) develop innovative assessment tools and a \u201ccomprehensive aging index\u201d summarizing the global impairment\nin behavior, physical functions and physiology, and a that can predict functional impairment and longevity, (iii)\nidentify social factors affecting individual variability in aging processes, and finally (iv) identify socio-behavioral\nintervention strategies to increase resilience. The R61 \u2013 development, proof-of-concept phase has 2 Aims. Aim\n1 will identify social factors affecting the pace of aging by using a randomized design that manipulates social\nconnectedness, social stability and social stress. We will also develop quantitative assessment tools relevant for\naging research. Aim 2 will develop a \u201ccomprehensive aging index\u201d, an algorithm which is based on quantifiable\nbehavioral, physical and physiological changes over the lifecourse. The R33 \u2013 implementation phase has 2 Aims.\nAim 3 will determine whether social rank, social instability and/or social deprivation affect lifespan in male and\nfemale mice and will implement the algorithm to predict longevity based on data collected during the lifecourse.\nAim 4 will implement behavioral strategies designed to increase resilience, including social rank reversal, social\nintegration and cognitive stimulation/environmental enrichment. At its completion, this project will develop novel\nexperimental paradigms and assessment tools with far reaching impact to the field. It will also generate an\nunprecedented new knowledge on how social factors affect health trajectories and aging, and which aging\nprocess is amenable to intervention versus those that are not amenable to intervention.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nAs the population of the United States ages, the health burden imposed by diseases of aging is expected to\nincrease concomitantly. Social factors, including low socioeconomic status, social isolation, and low social\nsupport, are among the best predictors of susceptibility to diseases of aging, as well as lifespan itself.\nNevertheless, key questions about the causal relationship and the biological mechanisms that link social\nexperiences to health and aging remain unanswered. Animal models are a powerful tool to address these\nquestions. Like humans, other social mammals exhibit strong associations between social adversity, health, and\nmortality. Unlike humans, though, they experience less complex environments, have shorter generation times,\nand can be subjected to experimental manipulation in controlled environments. However, the use of animal\nmodels to identify mechanisms underlying social determinants of aging and aging-associated diseases is still\nlimited. To grow and support the relevant research community, in 2020 we founded an R24 High-Priority\nBehavioral and Social Research Network on Animal Models for the Social Dimensions of Health and Aging\n(SDoHA). In less than four years, we have successfully grown the Network by supporting career development\nfellowships, and pilot grants as well as organizing meetings and scientific publications. These successes\nhighlight three areas central to accelerating research on animal models for SDoHA, which together inform the\nAims for this renewal application. Specifically, we will: Aim 1. Grow the animal models for SDoHA Network and\nsupport members at crucial career stages. Aim 2. Diversify the animal taxa used in the study of SDoHA. Aim 3.\nSupport the development of animal models for translational geroscience and foster collaborations with\nresearchers studying social gradients in humans. The renewal of our Network will continue to transform a weakly\nconnected community into a self-sustaining field of researchers equipped to conduct impactful research on the\nsocial dimensions of aging. Together, this work will lay the foundation for establishing models and experimental\napproaches that directly inform our understanding the social determinants of health and lifespan in animals and\nhumans, and are expected to have direct translational application to human health and well-being during aging.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nA leading cause of death worldwide, heart failure is often linked to deficits in energy production in\nmitochondria. Mitochondrial uptake of cytosolic Ca2+ plays a critical role in matching energy production to\ndemand by stimulating ATP production. However, mitochondrial Ca2+ in excess can lead to permeability\ntransition pore opening and potentially cell death. Animal models of heart failure more closely akin to heart\nfailure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are linked to increased mitochondrial Ca2+ in some studies and\ndecreased mitochondrial Ca2+ in others; even less is known regarding the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in heart\nfailure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). With the long-term goal of helping to develop therapies to limit\nor restore mitochondrial Ca2+ when appropriate to improve clinical outcomes in HFrEF and HFpEF, this\napplication will map out the contribution of increased and decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ to cardiac dysfunction\nin homeostasis and in mouse models of pressure overload and high fat/high sucrose diet with L-NAME.\nTamoxifen-inducible cardiac-specific deletion of Micu1, the gene encoding the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d of mitochondrial\nCa2+ uniporter complex (mtCU), will be used to induce mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. In the same manner,\ndeletion of Emre, the gene encoding the essential regulator of the mtCU, will be used to eliminate mtCU\nactivity and lower mitochondrial Ca2+. The overall objective in this application is to systematically compare the\neffects of increased and decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ on measures of cardiac health \u2013 mitochondrial function,\ntissue histology, contractility before and after stimulation \u2013 in homeostasis and in two different types of induced\nheart failure. The central hypothesis is that elevated mtCa2+ impairs heart function in homeostasis and in\nHFrEF, whereas lowered mtCa2+ has negative effects in energetically demanding states and in HFpEF. The\nrationale is that based on the literature and our preliminary data, pressure overload forces the heart to work\nharder, elevating mitochondrial Ca2+, while some indications suggest that mice fed the high fat/high sucrose\ndiet with L-NAME have lower mitochondrial Ca2+. Hence, in the former conditions, increased mitochondrial\nCa2+ is detrimental, and in the latter, decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ is detrimental. The central hypothesis will\nbe tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Assess how elevated and reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ impact\ncardiac homeostasis; and 2) Assess how elevated and reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ impact HFrEF and HFpEF-\nMetS. This research is conceptually innovative in using genetic manipulation to modulate mitochondrial Ca2+,\nand in directly comparing elevated and reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ in models approximating HFrEF and\nHFpEF. The outcomes of this research are expected to be significant by establishing a new paradigm\nregarding mitochondrial Ca2+ in HFrEF and HFpEF, with the potential to inform future therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nVisual Snow Syndrome (VSS) is a serious but poorly understood visual disorder characterized by the persistent\nperception of specks flickering across the entire visual field, akin to television snow. VSS has an estimated\nprevalence of 1.4-3.3% and is often accompanied by additional symptoms such as prominent afterimages\n(palinopsia), poor night vision, entoptic phenomena, and photophobia (light sensitivity). These symptoms make\ntasks like reading and driving particularly difficult. While previous research has focused on identifying the\ncommon symptoms and comorbidities, effective treatments have not been identified, the mechanisms underlying\nthe disorder are still unknown, and quantitative assessments of visual perception remain sparse. The proposed\nresearch seeks to address these knowledge gaps by measuring differences in visual performance and\nassociated neural processing with a series of well-established psychophysical and imaging paradigms. To\nprovide quantitative measures of perception and visual processing in VSS, we will assess (1) contrast sensitivity,\n(2) spatial context, and (3) temporal context perception in people with VSS compared to normally sighted controls\nthrough a series of fundamental psychophysical and high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) experiments. These experiments will help us understand how people with VSS perceive and process\ncontrast, which is an important measure of visual function that is related to performance on every-day visual\ntasks. Additionally, the proposed research will address how both spatial and temporal context are altered in\nVSS\u2014previous but sparse research suggests that both spatial and temporal context may be altered in VSS, but\nfurther evidence with both larger numbers of participants and robust measures of neural activity are required to\ninvestigate potential differences in visual context processing. Critically, we will also provide high resolution 7T\nfMRI measures of cortical responses during visual tasks to investigate potential differences in gain control\nthroughout the visual system. The proposed assessment of visual perception and accompanying measurements\nof neural processing in VSS are necessary to better characterize this disorder, and will help formulate hypotheses\nabout mechanisms underlying VSS.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nAcute leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, and remains one of the leading causes of death in children\nunder 15 years of age. Prevention, therefore, remains the ultimate goal. An essential part of future preventive\nefforts will involve identifying children harboring preleukemic clones at birth. Several leukemia-initiating genetic\nlesions have been shown to arise prenatally; however, many other leukemia-initiating lesions have not been\nexamined at birth. Several critical questions remain to be answered: 1) What subtypes and what proportion of\nchildhood leukemia develops in utero? 2) What is the specific cell(s) of origin in which preleukemic clones arise?\nand 3) Are some newborns more prone to developing leukemia-initiating lesions than others? In this project, we\nwill answer these questions, with a focus on the ~70% of patients with known translocation or point mutation driver\nevents. This project has three main aims. Aim 1: To identify the presence and clonal frequency of prenatal\nleukemia-initiating lesions at birth. We will obtain matched cord blood (CB) and diagnostic leukemia samples from\n~250 childhood leukemia patients in the Children\u2019s Oncology Group Project:Every Child study. Backtracking will\nfocus on ~182 patients with translocation/mutation-driven subtypes. We derive patient-specific somatic mutations\nfrom tumor profiling, then use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in flow-sorted CB cells to confirm the presence and\nfrequency of leukemia-initiating lesions at birth, and at different hematopoietic stages. We will also use ddPCR to\nbacktrack lesions in available newborn dried bloodspots (N ~45). Aim 2: To determine the cell of origin of leukemia-\ninitiating lesions, the transcriptomic changes from preleukemia to overt leukemia, and whether secondary\nmutations arise prenatally, across childhood leukemia subtypes. In 50 childhood leukemia patients where CB\nddPCR is positive we will conduct single-cell TARGET-seq on flow-sorted cell populations to simultaneously detect\nthe presence of each patient-specific leukemia-initiating events, secondary mutations, and gene expression in\ngenotypically- and immunophenotypically-defined populations at a single cell level.

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nAcute leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, and remains one of the leading causes of death in children\nunder 15 years of age. Prevention, therefore, remains the ultimate goal. An essential part of future preventive\nefforts will involve identifying children harboring preleukemic clones at birth. Several leukemia-initiating genetic\nlesions have been shown to arise prenatally; however, many other leukemia-initiating lesions have not been\nexamined at birth. Several critical questions remain to be answered: 1) What subtypes and what proportion of\nchildhood leukemia develops in utero? 2) What is the specific cell(s) of origin in which preleukemic clones arise?\nand 3) Are some newborns more prone to developing leukemia-initiating lesions than others? In this project, we\nwill answer these questions, with a focus on the ~70% of patients with known translocation or point mutation driver\nevents. This project has three main aims. Aim 1: To identify the presence and clonal frequency of prenatal\nleukemia-initiating lesions at birth. We will obtain matched cord blood (CB) and diagnostic leukemia samples from\n~250 childhood leukemia patients in the Children\u2019s Oncology Group Project:Every Child study. Backtracking will\nfocus on ~182 patients with translocation/mutation-driven subtypes. We derive patient-specific somatic mutations\nfrom tumor profiling, then use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in flow-sorted CB cells to confirm the presence and\nfrequency of leukemia-initiating lesions at birth, and at different hematopoietic stages. We will also use ddPCR to\nbacktrack lesions in available newborn dried bloodspots (N ~45). Aim 2: To determine the cell of origin of leukemia-\ninitiating lesions, the transcriptomic changes from preleukemia to overt leukemia, and whether secondary\nmutations arise prenatally, across childhood leukemia subtypes. In 50 childhood leukemia patients where CB\nddPCR is positive we will conduct single-cell TARGET-seq on flow-sorted cell populations to simultaneously detect\nthe presence of each patient-specific leukemia-initiating events, secondary mutations, and gene expression in\ngenotypically- and immunophenotypically-defined populations at a single cell level. Aim 3: To determine whether\nthe presence and frequency of preleukemic clones correlate with known risk factors for leukemia. Demographic,\nperinatal, and genetic risk factors for childhood leukemia will be obtained through parental survey, birth records,\nand sequencing data. For overall ALL and AML, and for common subtypes, we will test for association between\nrisk factors and the presence and clonal frequency of preleukemic clones at birth, as measured in Aim 1.

    "abstract_text": "The University of Minnesota Department of Pediatrics and Masonic Cancer Center propose to continue a highly successful training program in translational and genomic pediatric cancer epidemiology research. Our program is sought nationally by scholars, and provides opportunities for 2 postdoctoral and 2 predoctoral trainees to enhance their research and experience across a spectrum of pediatric cancer research, with a goal of interdisciplinary cross-training. With 16 outstanding mentoring faculty, trainees work in a variety of research settings including classical epidemiology, genomic epidemiology, and clinical investigations; laboratory studies may complement trainee work in the other areas. Along with seminars specific to pediatric cancer, strong graduate school degree programs at the University of Minnesota in Epidemiology (PhD), Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (Ph.D., M.S.) and in Clinical Research (MS) offer opportunities for courses in epidemiology, cancer epidemiology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, cancer biology, genetic epidemiology, bioinformatics, computational biology, immunology, clinical trials/methods, and field research. Further, students have several unparalleled opportunities for supervised translational and genomic research projects in human, in vitro data, study design and development, statistical analysis, and individual and team grant writing. Predoctoral students are formally admitted to the graduate school PhD program in Epidemiology or Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. The postdoctoral trainees are drawn from the medical, basic and applied sciences through national advertising and our Masonic Cancer Center members, and from the cohort of medical fellows in the Department of Pediatrics who have completed advanced clinical training in pediatric oncology and are embarking on the research component of their training. We anticipate that two of our postdoctoral trainees will choose to obtain an MS in clinical research or bioinformatics and computational biology. Criteria for selection of both pre- and postdoctoral trainees include a strong academic performance and a career orientation toward independent research in an academic, clinical, or public health setting. Each trainee is guided by at least two senior mentors from complementary disciplines in their research projects. All trainees participate in courses in pediatric cancer topics and readings in pediatric cancer epidemiology, weekly pediatric cancer seminar meetings and pediatric tumor conferences, monthly seminars, annual retreats, and presenters of their own research at national meetings. Postdoctoral students receive additional training in grant writing/preparation. All receive instruction in the responsible conduct of research. Trainees who graduate from this program will have the capacity to undertake high impact pediatric cancer research across a spectrum of disciplines.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks the third in cancer-related mortality because of ineffective therapy.\nIntratumoral accumulation of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), which suppresses antitumor immunity, has been identified\nin HCC. Despite the extensive research of microRNAs in HCC, their roles in regulating immunosuppression are\npoorly described. Aberrant activation of AKT (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1) and Nras\n(neuroblastoma ras viral oncogene homolog) (Ras) was observed in Kupffer cells (KCs) and hepatocytes (HCs)\nin 74% of HCC patients. Hydrodynamic injection (HDI) of activated forms of AKT and Nras (AKT/Ras) into mice\ntriggered the development of lethal HCC within 6-8 weeks. MiRNA profiling revealed that miR-15a and miR-16-\n1 cluster (miR-15a/16) was reduced in KCs from HCC tumors of AKT/Ras mice and patients. KC-specific\nexpression of miR-15a/16 fully prevented growth of aggressive HCC in AKT/Ras mice, while 100% of AKT/Ras\nmice died from lethal tumor burden within 6-8 weeks post-injection. KC-specific expression of miR-15a/16 also\nled to a significant regression of HCC tumors in AKT/Ras mice bearing tumors. Mechanistically, AKT/Ras\nreprogrammed the transcriptome of KCs toward M2 polarization of KCs and drove a significant increase in serum\nC-C motif chemokine 22 (CCL22) and mRNA levels of Ccl22 in KCs of AKT/Ras mice. In contrast, miR-15a/16\nreversed this process and inhibited CCL22 overproduction by directly targeting NF-\u03baB that activates transcription\nof Ccl22. CCL22 recruits Tregs via CCR4 (C-C chemokine receptor type 4). Indeed, additional treatment of CCL22\nrecovered immunosuppression and growth of HCC that was fully prevented by miR-15a/16 in AKT/Ras mice.\nWe hypothesize that AKT/Ras-educated KCs initiate hepatic recruitment of Tregs by overproducing CCL22,\nthereby promoting HCC development; while KC-specific expression of miR-15a/16 suppresses hepatic recruitment\nof Tregs and HCC development by attenuating CCL22 production. The objective of this project is to elucidate the\nrole of AKT/Ras-educated KCs in promoting immune suppression that promotes growth of HCC, while miR-15a/16\nreverses this process by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling in KCs. The long-time goal is to develop KCs as a therapeutic\ntarget and miR-15a/16 as a novel immunotherapy against HCC. Three specific aims are designed to test our\nhypothesis. Specifically, we will (1) unravel the mechanism(s) by which AKT/Ras-educated KCs promote\nimmunosuppression and HCC development. (2) establish the mechanism(s) by which miR-15a/16 drives\nantitumor immunity; and (3) evaluate the therapeutic potential of miR-15a/16 against HCC with divergent\nbackgrounds. The combination of strong preliminary data and a logical and rationally based experimental design\nmake this project highly feasible. We expect that this study will provide a novel insight into the immunosuppression\nmechanisms in HCC and facilitate the design of KCs as a novel therapeutic target and miR-15a/16 as a rational\nimmunotherapy against HCC.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nRecent studies have demonstrated that the adaptive immune response plays an important role Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease (AD) progression by promoting a pro-inflammatory state in the brain. This inflammatory process involves\nT cell and microglial cell activation. Such inflammatory processes are typically suppressed by a subset of T cells\ncalled regulatory T cells (Tregs). Significantly, Treg dysfunction is associated with AD in humans and in mouse\nmodels of AD. In addition to decreased Tregs in AD cases, studies have demonstrated that systemic depletion\nof Tregs exacerbates early AD pathology, while an increase in Tregs attenuates early AD pathology in transgenic\nmouse models of AD. However, these previous studies come with important caveats. First, all studies involving\nTreg depletion focused on studies in young mice at early stages of AD pathology, which may not be a clinically\nrelevant time-point. Second, studies using FOXP3-DTR mice and diphtheria toxin to selectively deplete Tregs\ndeplete Tregs everywhere and induce body-wide inflammation. This makes it difficult to assess whether worse\noutcomes observed in AD upon \u201cTreg depletion\u201d are specific to an effect of Tregs in the brain or due to massive\nsystemic inflammation. Moreover, the types of Tregs that accumulate during AD progression, and their functional\nrole in disease progression, particularly in brain, are also unknown. Thus, major gaps in our knowledge are\n(i) what types of Tregs are found in the brain during steady-state and in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and, (ii)\nwhat role Tregs or distinct subsets of Tregs play in ameliorating AD. Our preliminary studies demonstrate\nthat Tregs in tissues are quite diverse and that distinct Treg subsets occupy inflamed tissues with different\nkinetics. Most notably, we identified a novel population of Tregs, called ISG-Tregs, that accumulate in tissues\nwith IFN-driven inflammation. Previous studies of AD demonstrate that type I IFN is a characteristic of AD, that\nit exacerbates neurological damage in AD models, and plays an important role in initiating neuroinflammation\nand promoting AD progression. Thus, ISG-Tregs may play a critical role in AD progression. The goal of this\nproposal is to identify the subsets of Tregs present in the brain, and identify where those subsets are\nlocated within the brain, during AD progression, and establish murine models to directly test the function\nof Tregs and Treg subsets in AD. We will use scRNA-Seq and spatial proteomic/transcriptomic approaches to\ncharacterize Tregs during AD progression. Using a novel Treg reporter/deleter mouse strain that we developed\nwe will also develop new mouse models that will allow us to study the function of brain Tregs, or select brain\nTreg subsets, on AD progression. We will also provide important information regarding the pathological role of\nTreg at different stages of AD in vivo. These studies will allow us to characterize the types of Tregs present in\nAD, establish their localization in the brain during disease progression, and develop models that will allow us to\nestablish their functional role in ameliorating or exacerbating Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the future. Such information\nwill prove critical for better implementation of Treg-based therapies to improve outcomes in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nEffective cell-based immunity depends on two major systems: (i) the ability to generate a diverse TCR\nrepertoire capable of recognizing antigens from previously unencountered pathogens, and (ii) the ability to\ndiscriminate between self- and non-self-antigens and prevent autoimmunity. Inappropriate balance between\nthese two systems causes a variety of disease states including ineffective tumor immune surveillance and poor\npathogen clearance due to gaps in the TCR repertoire, or the onset of autoimmunity and off target\nimmunopathology during infection. Autoimmunity can be curtailed by deleting autoreactive TCRs or diverting\nthem into the Treg lineage in the thymus. However, given the high degree of cross-reactivity of TCRs this\nprocess cannot be truly efficient at removing all self-reactive TCRs as this would remove much of the potential\ndiversity of the conventional TCR repertoire, thereby impairing immunity to pathogens. Thus, a key biological\nquestion is how thymic selection functions to balance protection against autoimmunity while providing\neffective immunity against pathogens. We hypothesize that a unique population of thymic recirculating\nTreg cells (RT-Treg) act as a rheostat to decrease the stringency of selection once peripheral Treg cell\ntolerance is established, thereby allowing for a more diverse and pathogen-reactive conventional\nimmune system. This will be examined in two specific aims: Aim 1: Define RT-Treg heterogeneity and\nfunctional consequences of RT-Treg accumulation. Aim 2: Identify the mechanisms by which RT-Treg cells affect\nimmune repertoires and mTEC numbers. The proposed experiments will elucidate the role that RT-Treg play in\ngoverning the stringency of central tolerance, both promoting effector cell diversity and ensuring maintenance\nof self-tolerance by Treg cells.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nProgramming of self-antigen specific CD4+ Tregs in the thymus is essential for suppression of aberrant\nimmune responses and prevention of autoimmunity. Tregs also control inflammation during viral infection and\nfollowing pathogen clearance. This is particularly relevant for some types of viral infections such as the 1918\ninfluenza pandemic strain, and more recently, specific strains of coronaviruses, where the immune response\nitself can be pathogenic. In addition to viral infections, high levels of type I IFN are a defining feature of some\nautoimmune diseases, such as SLE or Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome; Tregs reduce the symptoms of such autoimmune\ndiseases as well. However, we know relatively little about the Tregs involved in either of the above processes.\nFor example, what types of Tregs are involved in these responses? Do Tregs that dampen anti-viral immune\nresponses or suppress SLE-like disease develop in the thymus? If so, what is the thymic niche that controls\ndifferentiation of this Treg subset? What APCs/stromal cells are required for differentiation of this Treg subset?\nWhat specific functional roles does this Treg subset play during viral infections or SLE? Our preliminary data\ndemonstrate that a unique subset of Tregs develops in the thymus characterized by a strong\ninterferon-stimulated gene-signature (ISG-Tregs). We propose that this ISG-Treg subset plays a key\nrole in governing antiviral immune responses and suppressing immune responses to autoimmune\ndiseases characterized by high levels of IFN. We will explore this hypothesis in two specific aims. In aim 1,\nwe will determine how IFN signaling in the thymus affects thymic selection and the development of ISG-Tregs.\nIn aim 2, we will determine the functions of ISG-Tregs in response to viral infections and systemic lupus\nerythematosis. Successful completion of these aims will allow us to identify the mechanism by which ISG-\nTregs arise in the thymus, and determine the role of ISG-Tregs in immune responses to viruses, and in\nautoimmune diseases associated with high levels of IFN, such as SLE or Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome.",

While\nsubthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GP) DBS using standard clinical targets and stimulation\nparameters can be highly effective for the treatment of the cardinal motor symptoms of PD, both treatments often\nfail to control levodopa-resistant motor features of PD. Previous studies, and our ongoing research, have\nprovided evidence that the most effective site for alleviating akinesia and bradykinesia was the\nposterolaterodorsal region of the GPi, near the border between the internal and external (GPe) segments, dorsal\nto the region typically targeted for GPi DBS. Moreover, DBS in this region can be effective for levodopa-resistant\nmotor signs. Currently, the mechanisms mediating the prokinetic effects of stimulation near the GPi-GPe border\n(GPi/e-DBS) are poorly understood. The primary goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the\npathways mediating the benefits of GPi/e-DBS on levodopa-resistant motor signs. The project will leverage\ntechnical advances in DBS lead design that allow current steering and adjustment of electric field orientation, in\nconjunction with patient-specific computational models, to tune stimulation to preferentially activate prokinetic\naxonal pathways (Aims 1 and 3). In addition, we will wirelessly record local field potentials from leads chronically\nimplanted in people with GP DBS (Aim 2), and use wearable technology to monitor gait and mobility during\nchronic stimulation in the home environment (Aim 2). Aim 1 will examine the effects of altering the orientation of\nthe electric field induced by GPi/e-DBS to be either parallel or orthogonal (lowest or highest net axonal activation\nthresholds, repectively) to putative striato-GPi and GPe to GPi afferent pathways (prokinetic connections of the\nbasal ganglia). Aim 2 will use the Medtronic Percept\u2122 PC DBS system with active sensing to study: (i) pallidal\noscillations associated with the re-emergence (wash-out) and suppression (wash-in) of gait impairment with\nGPi/e-DBS, (2) the up- and down-stream effects of GP DBS on motor network activity using 3T fMRI, and (iii)\nthe relationship between fluctuations in gait and GP LFPs during activities of daily living (recorded over 4 weeks).\nAim 3 will examine the effects of stimulation in the associative/limbic region of the GPe on gait and postural\ncontrol with and without an increased cognitive load (dual-task). Together, these experiments will provide critical\ninsight into the mechanisms and effects of GPi/e-DBS on basal ganglia and cortical-subcortical circuitry and\nmeasures of gait and postural control. This could lead to a new approach to using GP DBS to treat levodopa-\nresistant motor signs of PD.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nGreat advances are underway in the field of dementia. Symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s\u2019 disease (AD) can be\ndiagnosed with a simple blood test. The number of new dementia patients per capita is shrinking in parallel to\npublic health campaigns to improve brain health. New drugs are emerging that promise to effectively prevent or\ntreat dementing illness. While these breakthroughs in dementia diagnostics, prevention and treatment are\ncause for celebration, hardly anything is known about whether these advances will translate to Native\nAmerican (NA) communities, where very little is known about dementia from a biomedical perspective. For\ninstance, only two NA at the time of this writing have available blood test data in the AD Neuroimaging\nInitiative, the largest AD biobank in the United States. Approximately 200 NA have been included in the largest\nAD consortium in the country out of over 40,000 participants. This lack of knowledge regarding dementia in NA\nis problematic and portends a widening of already severe health disparities. The current study\u2019s central\nhypothesis is that American Indians have unique dementia risk factors and a differential effect of APOE \u03b54 \u2013\nthe most significant genetic risk factor for AD. These factors will change the epidemiology of dementia and\npreclude a \u201cone size fits all\u201d AD blood test using APOE \u03b54, The first goal of the current project is to determine\nwhat types of dementia exist among NA Tribal Nations, which is currently unknown but is a first-step to\ndesigning and implementing effective brain health policy. The second goal involves measuring the ancestry-\ndependent effect of APOE on AD risk and AD biology in NA. AD blood tests utilize the APOE gene along with\ndirect quantification of the toxic proteins associated with AD to determine a positive or negative result. If\ninherited from a European ancestor, having an APOE \u03b54 allele increases the chances of AD and also\nincreases the probability of a positive AD blood test result. But if a patient inherits their APOE \u03b54 gene from an\nAfrican ancestor, there is an attenuated impact on accumulation of toxic proteins that define AD. The same\nneutral relationship between APOE \u03b54 and AD likely applies to NA \u2013 preliminary data from our group and\nothers suggest that inheriting an APOE \u03b54 gene from a NA ancestor similarly does not increase the risk of AD.\nIf an NA individual undergoes an AD blood test and carries an APOE \u03b54 allele, will they receive a life-changing\nbut false diagnosis for a devastating condition? Our study thus will measure the relationship between APOE\nand AD risk/biology in NA. As APOE is also a centerpiece of personalized medicine, risk/benefit discussions\nfor anti-amyloid therapy, trial eligibility, and the target of genetically guided therapies, this study will provide\ncritical knowledge about the applicability of APOE based medical advances to NA. This is the first study to our\nknowledge that attempts to bring American Indian dementia care into the 21st century and provide a\nfoundation for this understudied group to benefit from the latest advances in diagnosis, prevention treatment of\ndementia.",

However, few efforts have culturally adapted dementia care and caregiving\ninterventions for racial/ethnic minority populations. Existing adaptations have not been\nsystematically conducted or documented, and have not focused on Black immigrants. The\nobjective of this K01 award is to acquire targeted training in the cultural adaptation and\nfeasibility testing of behavioral interventions for racial/ethnic minority older adults. The\ncandidate\u2019s training goals are to: 1) Build expertise in dementia, cognitive impairment, and long-\nterm care for Black immigrant older adults; 2) Expand skills in the development, delivery, and\nimplementation of culturally relevant behavioral interventions for Black immigrants; 3) Design\nand conduct a feasibility study with community dwelling older adults; 4) Apply advanced\nstatistical methods to analyze paired, longitudinal, pre-and post-test, and clinical trial data; and\n5) Obtain the experience necessary to advance as a well-rounded successful independent\nscientist (e.g. grant writing expertise, increased first-author peer-reviewed publications,\nmentorship of junior scholars etc.). Mentored research training will occur in the context of a\ndedicated project with these specific aims:1) Explore the experiences and care strategies used\nby Black immigrant older adults with dementia and their informal caregivers. 2) Guided by the\nEcological Validity Model, use the knowledge gained from Aim 1 to culturally adapt the\nevidenced-based Active Caregiving: Empowering Skills (ACES) for Black immigrant older adults\nwith dementia and their informal caregivers. 3) Determine the feasibility and acceptability of the\nculturally adapted ACES intervention with Black immigrant older adults with dementia and their\ninformal caregivers. The candidate\u2019s mentoring team has extensive expertise in these areas and\nwill offer mentoring, consultation, hands-on training, networking/collaborations and resources to\nfacilitate the candidate\u2019s career development. The 2020 NIA Dementia Care Summit Gaps and\nOpportunities highlights the need for research that explores differences in the effects of social\nand cultural determinants of dementia care and caregiving. Completion of this research and\ntraining meets this research need and will enable the candidate to become a successful\nindependent scientist with substantive expertise in dementia care and cultural adaptation of\ninterventions for racial/ethnic minority community-dwelling older adults.

Very few treatments have been investigated despite the tremendous\npublic health burden posed by FASD. Cognition is a natural target for intervention because deficits\ncontribute to problems with adaptive functioning, social skills, and independent living. A decade of\nresearch suggests that cognitive training has beneficial effects on functional brain networks -\nmediating cognition in a variety of neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions. We believe it\ncan improve cognitive performance in individuals with FASD. The primary objective of our existing\nline of neuromodulation research and the proposed RCT is to leverage the ability of tDCS to enhance\ncortical excitability and neural plasticity in order to maximize the cognitive training benefits in children\nand adolescents with FASD.\n Recently we carried out a pilot randomized controlled trial of tDCS-augmented cognitive\ntraining to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of this approach in children with FASD (Boroda,\nKrueger, et al., 2020). We showed that the intervention was safe and well-tolerated in this population.\nFurther, despite applying a relatively low-dose of tDCS and cognitive training, we found that the group\nreceiving active-tDCS demonstrated greater improvements on an attention task than a group\nreceiving sham-tDCS. These promising pilot results merit replication in a larger clinical trial.\n We propose a fully-powered randomized controlled trial of 60 (at completion) children and\nadolescents with FASD who will receive cognitive training in combination with tDCS. We hypothesize\nthat, in conjunction with cognitive training, five initial sessions of active tDCS will produce a\nsignificantly greater improvement in sustained attention (CPT) than sham tDCS. We also\nhypothesize that, in conjunction with cognitive training, a total of ten sessions of active tDCS will\nproduce a significantly greater improvement in sustained attention (CPT) than five sessions of active\ntDCS. We also aim to establish the long-term durability of neurocognitive improvements and\nassociated behavioral changes resulting from tDCS and cognitive training. Finally, we plan to use\npre-intervention and post-intervention resting-state fMRI data to show functional network changes\nrelated to the intervention and to quantify the relationship between dose and functional network\nchanges. Results of the trial will directly inform future clinical implementation of cognitive training and\ntDCS as a potential neurodevelopmental intervention.",

Few treatments have been investigated despite FASD\u2019s\ntremendous public health burden. Cognitive deficits are a core feature of FASD, and cognition is a\nnatural target for intervention. One potential intervention for cognition in FASD is the essential\nnutrient choline - known to have effects on brain development and cognition. In the hippocampus,\ncholine contributes to increased dendritic arborization, larger cells, and functional changes. Choline\naffects the cholinergic system and alters brain structure and function in regions essential for memory\nfunctioning, including methylation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Only a handful of human\ncholine studies for FASD have been undertaken and our group has conducted most of them. Our\nearly double-blind, randomized, controlled trial established safety and tolerability. Our subsequent\ntrial revealed beneficial effects for sequential delayed memory in participants with FASD (greater in\nyounger [ages 2-3] rather than older [ages 3-5] children). Our third (ongoing) study included a long-\nterm follow-up that demonstrated long-term benefits for choline vs. placebo in non-verbal processing,\nworking memory, long-term verbal memory, and ADHD behavior. The proposed studies will include a\nnew clinical trial with a new cohort of 2-5 year old children with FASD. Rather than a placebo-\ncontrolled trial, it will be a two-arm block-randomized study with cumulative choline exposure\ndurations of 3 or 6 months. Results will directly inform future clinical implementation of choline as a\nneurodevelopmental intervention. The proposed studies will also capitalize on three existing cohorts\nfor additional longitudinal studies that will determine durability of effects from early treatment. A 4-\nyear and 8-year follow-up study will each examine cognitive effects as well as structural and\nfunctional brain effects using advanced MRI methods. Cognitive measures will include the Stanford-\nBinet Intelligence Scale, the Elicited Imitation memory test, the NIH Toolbox Flanker test and Picture\nSequence Memory Test, and the Minnesota Executive Function Scale. We will examine choline\neffects on behavior using parent-report (CBCL) and a structured diagnostic interview (KSADS).\nSelect hippocampal sub-fields will be examined for volumetric improvements following choline or\nplacebo. Functional connectivity will be examined and is expected to reflect changes from early\ncholine supplementation. We will also use cortical myelin mapping to evaluate choline\u2019s effect on\nlong-term myelin development. In addition, we will apply diffusion-weighted imaging to determine\ncholine\u2019s effect on white matter microstructure \u2013 which is known to be disrupted in FASD.",

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) target highly conserved sites on HIV-1 Envs and neutralize\na wide range of diverse strains from different clades. Nevertheless, bnAb immunotherapy aiming to suppress\nHIV-1 replication sometimes leads to development of bnAb-resistant HIV-1 strains, and HIV-1 strains with pre-\nexisting bnAb resistance can be identified by prescreening before treatment. Thus, understanding the underlying\nmechanisms of bnAb resistance are critical for the future application of bnAbs for immunotherapy and prevention.\nMechanisms that lead to multi-bnAbs resistance and indirect mechanisms that facilitate escape of bnAbs from\ndifferent groups are of particular public health concern.\nOur study is structured to provide important insights into bnAb resistance at different levels. In Specific Aim 1 we\nwill study direct resistance mechanisms of rebounded HIV-1 strains that are resistant to multiple bnAbs. We will\nscreen samples from clinical studies of bnAb therapy, identify Envs of HIV-1 strains that exhibit the highest\ndegree of resistance to several bnAbs, study Env sequence, function, glycosylation patterns and determine the\nstructures of resistant Envs at atomic level resolution. Our comprehensive approach will provide unique profiles\nof selected multi-bnAb resistant Envs that integrate all potential mechanisms contributing to bnAb resistance. In\na parallel direction, we will study the ability of rebounded HIV-1 strains to spread through cell-cell transmission,\nwhich allows efficient viral replication in the presence of different groups of bnAbs. We will test the hypothesis\nthat bnAb-sensitive HIV-1 strains that replicate despite high levels of bnAb in the serum of participants from the\nRV397 trial can efficiently spread by cell-cell transmission. Additionally, we will investigate the molecular\nmechanisms of strains that exhibit increased cell-cell transmission efficiency and bnAb resistance. In Specific\nAim 2 we will define optimal bnAb combinations to overcome bnAb resistance and use antibody yeast display\ntechnology to bioengineer recombinant bnAbs with improved affinity against bnAb-sensitive and resistant HIV-1\nstrains. This approach will allow us to confirm mechanisms of HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs and to test the\nhypothesis that specific changes in bnAbs can improve bnAb breadth and allow targeting of a subset of resistant\nHIV-1 strains.\nOverall, our study will provide high-resolution and comprehensive view on multi-bnAb resistant HIV-1 Envs, on\nalternative pathways of HIV-1 resistance in vivo, and on potential approaches to overcome bnAb resistance.

HIV-1 Envs of most primary HIV-1 strains typically exist in a closed conformation (State 1) and\noccasionally transit to downstream, more open conformations (State 2 and State 3). Thus, current knowledge\nguides immunogen design towards mimicking the Env closed conformation as the preferred target for eliciting\nbroadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to block HIV-1 entry. However, Env preferred conformations of more\nthan 37 million different circulating HIV-1 strains are unlikely to adopt exactly the same closed conformation. And\nwe still do not know how different State 1 conformations of diverse natural HIV-1 variants are.\nOur hypothesis: State 1 Envs form a heterogenous group of Envs that exist in similar but not identical\nconformations. Accordingly, improved ability of bnAbs to recognize multiple Env conformations will\nbroaden their neutralization activity.\nTo test our hypothesis, we will assess the conformational heterogeneity of Envs from different strains and build\nmechanistic models for 1) Envs transitions, 2) generation and transmission of Envs that exist in specific\nconformations, and 3) broad recognition of different Env states. In Specific Aim 1 we will study the conformational\ndiversity of transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 strains, which can establish HIV-1 in vivo and are the only target of\na preventive vaccine. We will study the mechanisms by which T/F Envs expose internal elements and how they\ntransit to downstream conformations. In Specific Aim 2 we will investigate the generation and evolution of\nincompletely closed Env conformation. We will reconstruct the evolution pathway of T/Fs in patients by using\navailable viral sequences to build evolved viruses at different time point followed by investigating changes in\ntheir conformational states over time. In parallel, we will study Env conformational diversity among HIV-1 strains\nthat are archived in the latent HIV-1 reservoir of people living with HIV-1 and identify potential targets for\ntherapeutic interventions. These approaches will allow us to build a mechanistic model for how incompletely\nclosed Envs are generated, evolved, and transmitted. In Specific Aim 3 we will define important parameters for\nbroad recognition of CD4-binding site (CD4-bs) on different Env conformations of diverse primary strains. We\nwill study how the exceptionally broad N6 (CD4-bs) bnAb recognizes different Env conformations, will identify\ncritical interactions with residues on open and closed Env conformations, and will solve cryo-EM structures of\nHIV-1 Envs in complex with N6 to define the mechanism of broad recognition.\nOverall, our study will provide high-resolution and comprehensive view on the biology of HIV-1 entry pathway,\nwill refine the knowledge on HIV-1 Env conformations, and will form a strong basis for the development of new\nstrategies for HIV-1 cure and vaccine design.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nAdrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a progressive X-linked neurological disorder with unpredictable variation in\nexpression. During childhood, about 1 in 3 boys develop rapidly progressing cerebral ALD with brain\ninflammation and myelin destruction. Although existing treatments stop progression of cerebral ALD when\ndetected at an early stage, no current assessments can identify which boys will develop cerebral ALD or when\nit will begin. Newborn screening programs that identify ALD at birth offer an opportunity to provide earlier\ntreatment that avoids irreversible neurocognitive decline while new treatments may present safer alternatives\nto standard stem cell therapy. This K23 Career Development Award aims to provide the PI with the necessary\ntraining to become an independent investigator proficient in cross-modal methodologies to measure subtle\nbrain changes in children with ALD and apply those methods in clinical research protocols. With mentorship\nfrom a team of experts at the University of Minnesota, the applicant proposes the following training objectives:\n(1) to obtain knowledge and experience in acquisition and analysis of neuroimaging data; (2) to learn statistical\nand computational methods for validation of novel neurocognitive tests; and (3) to acquire the expertise to\ndesign and execute clinical trials. The overall research objectives are designed to identify early neurocognitive\nand neuroimaging markers of cerebral demyelination and enhance the capacity of clinical trials of newer\ntherapies to define robust endpoints for boys who receive early treatment. The central hypothesis is that\ndeterioration in white matter fiber integrity and associated loss of interhemispheric function involving the corpus\ncallosum mark the onset of cerebral ALD, and begin prior to the appearance of a lesion on MRI. To test this\nhypothesis, the PI will test several methods designed to measure changes associated with demyelination. The\nspecific aims will use longitudinal neurocognitive testing (Aim 1) and longitudinal diffusion MRI studies (Aim 2)\nto identify functional and microstructural markers of cerebral ALD in boys with early stage disease, and test for\npresence of these markers during the critical pre-emergent stage in at-risk boys. The neurocognitive findings\nwill also be compared to MRI metrics of disease progression. The successful completion of these Aims will\nidentify reliable indicators of disease onset and early progression. The proposed research is significant\nbecause detection and quantification of subtle progressive brain changes in boys with ALD will allow earlier\nand more effective intervention to reduce the neurocognitive morbidity. The training objectives will support the\napplicant's career goals to lead a long-term program of research to identify sensitive markers of brain\ndysfunction in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, with the goal of informing timing and\nefficacy of interventions to achieve better patient outcomes.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\n Physiological and metabolic health relies on the circadian alignment of biological processes with the\nenvironment. Since the first documented study of circadian rhythms in the 18th century using a plant system,\nmodel organisms have been critical for defining the transcriptional mechanism of the oscillator and revealing the\nimportance of the clock on fitness. Most of this work is based on whole organism or organ level studies leaving\nmany mechanistic questions about how cell specific gene regulation leads to coordination of cellular clocks and\na concerted physiological response. We know that gene regulatory networks are effective at modeling gene\nexpression dynamics but resolving cell-type specific networks with time resolution remains a significant\nchallenge.\n To delineate regulatory connections across cell-types, a single cell view is needed to develop network\nmodels that reflect the true cell state rather than the variation among groups of cells or tissues. Only with these\ncell specific networks can we begin to develop testable hypotheses about what regulatory variation underlies\nphysiological responses. This proposal describes a research strategy that leverages the genetic and molecular\npower of the plant model system Arabidopsis thaliana and the latest single cell technologies to 1) Identify the\ncell-types with distinct oscillators and their underlying regulatory networks, 2) Dissect how cell-type specific\ncircadian regulatory networks maintain a synchronized physiological response, and 3) Perturb cell-type specific\ncircadian gene regulatory networks and evaluate their physiological consequences.\n Over the next five years, our goals are to delineate single cell circadian gene regulatory networks across\nan entire organ with spatial resolution. Our Arabidopsis model system will be used to dissect how distinct cell\ntype specific circadian regulation controls a physiological response. Through perturbations to tissue specific\ngene regulatory networks we will gain a better understanding of how cellular gene programming is coordinated.\nOur long-term goal is to develop Arabidopsis into a model for understanding how cell specific gene regulatory\nnetworks influence inter-tissue communication. This research will generate valuable insight into how we interpret\nthe influence of circadian gene regulatory variation on human health and the application of targeted therapies.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSenescent cells (SnCs) accumulate with age and contribute to morbidity and mortality in model systems. SnCs\nalso play a role in normal physiology, e.g., wound healing. Currently it is unclear when and where SnCs arise in\ntissues with age, how heterogenous SnCs are in vivo, and how to best identify them and their role in physiology\nvs. pathology, especially in humans. The goal of the Midwest Murine-Tissue Mapping Center (MM-TMC)\nBiological Analysis Core (BAC) is to leverage the utility of the mouse as a model organism to map SnCs, which\nwill help inform the human SnC atlases under development by SenNet. We propose to validate, optimize, and\napply state-of-the-art methodologies for bulk and single cell characterization and spatiotemporal analysis of\nSnCs in healthy mouse tissues over a range of ages in two genetic backgrounds. The MM-TMC BAC will focus\non adipose, skeletal muscle, liver, brain, and lung tissues from inbred C57BL/6J and f1 hybrid (C57BL/6J:FVB/n)\nmice. The data generated by the BAC will be delivered to the Data Analysis Core (DAC) for integration to develop\nSnC atlases for the five tissues. The BAC will be led by Nathan LeBrasseur, an expert in the identification and\ncharacterization of SnCs in skeletal muscle and lung in mice and humans, and in biomarker discovery; Paul\nRobbins, an expert in senolytic development; and Laura Niedernhofer, an expert in the study of SnCs in\ntransgenic mice. The three MPIs are part of a P01 led by Overall PI Sundeep Khosla, which develops,\ncharacterizes, and utilizes innovative transgenic mice that permit the induction of SnCs in a particular organ or\ncell type, report expression of the SnC-driving genes p16Ink4a or p21Cip1, or specifically kill cells expressing those\ngenes. These mice will be important tools in SenNet for mapping efforts and validating probes to detect SnCs.\nThe BAC analytical workflow will be based within existing cores at Mayo Clinic and University of Minnesota\n(UMN) to guarantee a stable infrastructure and high quality control standards: the UMN Imaging Centers, the\nUMN Genomics Center, Mayo CyTOF Core, the UMN Center for Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics (CMSP),\nthe UMN Cytokine Reference Laboratory, and Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. These cores contain state-\nof-the-art instrumentation available for mapping SnCs: Ionpath Multiplexed Ion Beam Mass Imaging, Visium\nSpatial Gene Expression, and NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling. In addition, the CMSP will use a\nproteogenomic approach to identify novel SnC-specific protein sequences as biomarkers. These unique\nresources, together with the MPIs\u2019 expertise, will be valuable for building the 4D tissue atlases. Broadly, the BAC\nproposes to: 1) Establish a pipeline of reproducible, validated, and quantitative assays to detect and characterize\nSnCs in whole tissues and single cell preparations; 2) Use primary mouse cells as a controlled model for\nvalidating analytical tools, studying the evolution of SnCs over time, and identifying novel SnC biomarkers; 3)\nScale-up the data generation pipeline and incorporate emerging technologies; and 4) Perform spatiotemporal\nanalysis of SnCs in the five tissues to enable the DAC to generate 4D SnC atlases.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\nThrombosis is the leading cause of mortality among patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). MPNs\nare characterized by excessive production of red blood cells, platelets, and/or leukocytes. Thrombosis risk in\nMPNs is thought to be primarily secondary to excess clonal MPN cells. However, at present, the interaction\nbetween the vascular endothelium and clonal MPN cells is poorly characterized. Clonal MPN growth is driven\nby dysregulated Janus kinase-signal transductor and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling. The\nJAK2V617F+ mutation occurs in up to 70% of MPN patients and increases the risk of thrombosis 6-fold.\nAdditionally, MPN patients have a higher risk of VTE in slow-flow splanchnic vasculature. Several in vitro and\nin vivo studies demonstrate that endothelial cells (EC) with the JAK2V617F+ mutation express pro-adhesive and\nthrombotic proteins, suggesting that EC signaling may contribute to increased thrombosis. My primary\nobjective is to define how EC activation contributes to MPN thrombosis. My central hypothesis is that within\nthe EC vascular, the JAK2V617F+ mutation evokes a pro-inflammatory and thrombotic cascade. In preliminary\nstudies, I evaluated blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) isolated from JAK2V617F+ patients. In JAK2V617F+\nBOECs and in TNF-\u03b1-activated JAK2WT ECs, ruxolitinib and fedratinib (JAK1/2 inhibitors approved for use in\nMPN) reduced tissue factor (TF) expression and activity. Additionally, Compared to JAK2WT ECs, JAK2V617F+\nBOECs express higher levels von Willebrand factor (VWF), and growth arrest specific 6 (Gas6) protein. Gas6\nis a vitamin-K dependent protein S homolog, which promotes both TF expression and triggers platelet and\nmonocyte activation after binding to receptors Axl, MERTK, and Tyro3. Interestingly, in preliminary studies,\nJAK2V617F+ individuals had significantly higher plasma levels of Gas6, Axl, and MERTK than controls.\nImportantly, recent work has shown that blockade of the Gas6-Axl pathway kills JAK2V617F+ hematopoietic stem\ncells in vitro and reduces spleen size and prolongs survival in JAK2V617F+ mice. However, these studies did\nnot evaluate whether the Gas6-Axl-MERTK axis contributes to MPN thrombosis. Phenotypic variability\nlimits use of JAK2V617F animal models to assess hemostasis and thrombosis. Therefore, I propose to use\nendothelialized microfluidics models to assess how JAK2V617F expression increases EC activation. Using an\nendothelialized microfluidics model, I will culture JAK2V617F+ EC under physiologic shear to assess for changes\nin pro-coagulant and adhesive function. Furthermore, I will assess pro-adhesive and thrombotic interactions\nbetween JAK2V617F+ EC and whole blood. I will also explore how Gas6-Axl-MERTK signaling in JAK2V617F+ ECs\nincreases the pro-coagulant and pro-adhesive environment. Collectively, the proposed research will establish\nthe contribution of shear to JAK2V617F+ EC activation and evaluate Gas6-Axl-MERTK signaling in JAK2V617F+\npro-thrombotic activation.",

However, prior research is limited by\nheavy reliance on cross-sectional analyses and a focus on immersion-type interventions (e.g., inpatient\ntreatment), which are not widely available. Identifying neurobehavioral predictors of response to clinically\napplicable treatments will stimulate needed progress in the emerging field of precision medicine. Building on a\nfunded, randomized comparative effectiveness trial (R01-DK123273), the current study will prospectively\nexamine neurobehavioral predictors of initial weight loss response and weight loss maintenance for\nadolescents with obesity participating in intensive lifestyle modification therapy (LMT) or low intensity LMT plus\nmedical management using the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA), semaglutide. In the\nproposed study we will: 1) identify baseline neurobehavioral predictors of weight loss response in adolescents\nwith obesity undergoing intervention; 2) for participants achieving >5% BMI reduction at 6 months (i.e. initial\nresponders), identify neurobehavioral predictors of weight loss maintenance at 12; and 3) evaluate differences\nin predictors of response between intensive LMT and GLP-1RA therapy. This prospective, observational study\nwill include 116 adolescents with obesity and will focus on the three main aspects of executive functions -\ninhibition, cognitive flexibility, and working memory \u2013 as well as reward responsivity using gold-standard\nmeasures. For each domain, a single factor (i.e., score) will be created from factor analysis and these latent\nfactors will be used as predictors in the statistical models. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to\nevaluate neurobehavioral predictors of weight loss response to GLP-1RA therapy in adolescents. Moreover,\nwe will be one of few who have prospectively evaluated neurobehavioral predictors of treatment response and\nweight loss maintenance for adolescents with obesity.

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\n This project aims to solve numerous challenges in aryne difunctionalization en route to highly decorated\narene rings, critical components of most pharmaceuticals. Currently, methods to functionalize arenes in multiple\npositions require iterative coupling reactions. Difunctionalization of arynes provides an attractive strategy to\nincorporate multiple functional groups into an arene ring. Unfortunately, these reactions are plagued with\nproblems with accessing starting materials due to multistep syntheses, limited reaction scope, and poor site\nselectivity for the two possible positions of the triple bond in an aryne.\n Our group aims to overcome all of these challenges by using transition metal catalysis to expand the\nscope and utility of aryne difunctionalization. We plan to use C1 symmetric ligands in order to control\nregioselectivity of the functional group addition to the aryne. Additionally, by the introduction of transition metal\ncatalysis with new aryne precursors that have previously never been used in catalysis, we will allow access to\naryne rings that were previously inaccessible due to ring strain. The transition metal catalyst will be able to bind\nto the aryne and relieve ring strain. Finally, a wide variety of new difunctionalization reactions are proposed.\nThese new reactions encompass additions of F, N, and CF3 groups due to their importance in medicinal\nchemistry.\n If the goals of this proposal are achieved, we anticipate that this chemistry will provide easy access to a\nwide variety of highly functionalized arene rings. These will provide important building blocks and opportunities\nfor late stage functionalization of medically relevant molecules.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nLimbal stem cell (LSC) deficiency is a blinding disease that accounts for an estimated 15-20% of corneal\nblindness worldwide. LSC deficiency is caused by excessive loss of LSC, a population of pluripotent cells that\nregenerate the transparent corneal epithelium. Loss of LSC due to chemical injuries and autoimmune disease\nresults in corneal conjunctivalization, erosions, and melting. Treatment options are limited; however, cultured\nlimbal epithelial cell transplantation (CLET) is a promising emerging therapy. In CLET ex vivo expanded limbal\nstem/progenitor cells (LSPC) are transplanted onto diseased eyes to replace the native LSC and regenerate the\ncorneal epithelium. Short-term success has been reported with CLET; however, long-term outcomes have been\nlimited by loss of transplanted LSPC and recurrence of LSC deficiency over time. One reason for this is the lack\nof a supportive niche. Under physiological conditions, the microenvironment of the limbus, known as the limbal\nniche, sustains the pluripotency and proliferative potential of native LSC. However, in LSC deficiency, the limbal\nniche is often damaged. Identification of synthetic and biological substrates that can function as niche substitutes\nto support transplanted LSPC remains an ongoing challenge and an unaddressed barrier to long-term success\nin regenerative therapies for the ocular surface. Although human amniotic membrane (HAM) is the primary\nsubstrate used for CLET, it is limited as a long-term niche substitute by its opacity, rapid degradation, and lack\nof limbus-specific proteins. In contrast Descemet\u2019s Membrane (DM), is a basement membrane on the posterior\nsurface of the cornea is clear and resistant to collagenase digestion. Furthermore, the anterior fetal banded layer\nof DM is rich in limbus-specific basement membrane proteins, including collagen IV \u03b11, \u03b12 subtypes, vitronectin,\nand BM40/SPARC. The goal of this study is to compare the stemness and survival of donor and iPSC-derived\nLSPC on DM vs HAM. In aim 1, we will perform in vitro phenotypic and functional comparisons of LSPC cultured\non DM vs HAM using biomarker expression and an organ culture model of LSC deficiency. In aim 2, we will\nperform an in vivo comparison of cultured LSPC on DM vs HAM using a mouse model of LSC deficiency. In aim\n3, we will compare biomarker expression and capacity to regenerate corneal epithelium in iPSC-derived LSPC\ncultured on DM vs HAM. This project has the potential to inform our choice of substrate in CLET and improve\nour therapies for LSC deficiency. The training plan will provide the applicant with technical competencies in the\ncharacterization of LSPC, use of animal models of LSC deficiency, and manipulation of iPSC; as well as\nprofessional skills in oral and written communication to facilitate development as an independent investigator.\nTraining will take place in University of Minnesota\u2019s (UMN) highly collaborative and well-resourced research\nenvironment. The applicant will be mentored by Dr. Deborah Ferrington, a leader in applications of iPSC\ntechnology in age-related macular degeneration, Dr. Ali Djalilian, a pioneer in therapeutic interventions for limbal\nstem cell deficiency, and Dr. James Dutton, director of the UMN Stem Cell Institute, Innovation Facilities.",

In methylotrophic bacteria, one-carbon metabolites such as\nmethanol can serve as growth substrates in pathways where formaldehyde is an obligate central intermediate.\nDue to its high chemical reactivity, formaldehyde balance in these organisms is critical; however, their\nformaldehyde stress response systems have remained elusive. EfgA and TtmR are central players of two distinct\nsystems that modulate formaldehyde resistance and disrupt formaldehyde homeostasis in the methylotroph\nMethylorubrum (formerly Methylobacterium) extorquens. EfgA is a newly identified conserved formaldehyde\nsensor that halts growth and translation in response to elevated formaldehyde levels. TtmR is a MarR-family\ntranscription factor that regulates many genes involved in regulation, signaling, and stress response, including\nefgA. Our work will characterize the EfgA and TtmR homeostasis systems to understand how cells sense and\nrespond to formaldehyde levels to prevent otherwise inevitable cellular damage. Specifically, we will employ\nunbiased sequencing-based approaches and experimental evolution to home in on the mechanisms of these\nsystems and define their regulation. Formaldehyde-mediated cellular damage is a readout of the status of\nformaldehyde homeostasis; however, the in vivo reactivity of formaldehyde is poorly understood. Our data\nsuggests that protein damage is the predominant cause of cytotoxicity in M. extorquens. We will use proteomics\napproaches to define the impact of formaldehyde on the proteome and identify cellular strategies for\ncounteracting formaldehyde-induced protein damage. Through this work, we will leverage a model bacterium\nthat is well adapted to maintain formaldehyde homeostasis to explore the burgeoning field of formaldehyde\nregulatory biology. The results from this work will define essential cellular processes and has implications for\nanalogous homeostasis systems for toxic metabolites. We envision this work will have substantial impacts on\nthe understanding of how cells sense and regulate formaldehyde levels, how cells navigate and avoid\naccumulation of toxic metabolites generally, and how metabolite-specific and global systems of stress response\nintersect to provide balanced cellular metabolism and growth.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary and Abstract\nParkinson's disease (PD) symptoms of postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) cause profound\ndisability and are inadequately treated by current therapies. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the\nsubthalamic nucleus (STN) and Globus Pallidus (GP) is effective for PIGD, but not nearly as much as\nfor other PD symptoms e.g. bradykinesia and rigidity. Standard DBS optimization relies on assessing\nchanges in symptoms each time stimulation changes, a very time consuming process. PIGD changes\nslowly in response to changes in stimulation. Hence, DBS is normally optimized to quicker-\nresponding symptoms, which may be why DBS works better for symptoms other than PIGD. The goal\nof DBS optimization is to affect neural target structures which best ameliorate symptoms. Different\ntarget structures may ameliorate different symptoms. While bradykinesia and rigidity are thought to\nrespond to stimulation of the subthalamopallidal projection, PIGD is thought to involve other\nstructures, especially pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). PPN afferents and efferents, passing through\nor near STN & GP may therefore be more effective stimulation targets for PIGD.\nNew directional DBS electrodes, coupled with high field strength MRI imaging and patient-specific\ncomputational models, now enable more selective targeting of these pathways. We hypothesize that\ntargeting the ascending PPN efferent pathway will increase the effectiveness of DBS on PIGD,\nwhereas targeting the descending pallidofugal pathway, by inhibiting PPN, will decrease its\neffectiveness for PIGD.\nWe will compare effects on gait, postural instability, bradykinesia, and rigidity, of DBS\ntargeting pedunculopallidal and pallidopeduncular pathways, directly, as well as subthalamopallidal\npathway directly, pallidosubthalamic pathway directly, and pallidopeduncular pathway\nindirectly (by targeting inhibitory afferents to GP pars interna GPi). Preoperative 7 Tesla\nstructural and diffusion-weighted MRI scans and postoperative high-resolution CT scans will\ndetermine electrode location and orientation, relative to nuclei and fiber tracts. Patient-specific\nmodels from these imaging datasets will estimate percent activation of each fiber tract, and a\nnovel particle swarm optimization will design stimulation settings maximizing the difference in\nactivation between pathways being compared. Aims 1 (STN) & 2 (GP) compare settings in a single-\nsession, within-subjects experimental design. Aim 3 compares settings with much longer wash- in/\nout intervals, and will also collect data between laboratory testing sessions using measures of\nfunctional status and quality of life. This project will comprehensively investigate how DBS can\nbe tailored on a patient-specific basis to treat disabling symptoms of PIGD.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nUnderstanding the biological basis of aging-related diseases is becoming paramount as the global population\nages and the burden of chronic disease weighs on healthcare systems. Cellular senescence has emerged as a\nunifying feature of multiple age-associated pathologies, having been identified as a significant player in\nnumerous cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, and age associated muscle\ndysfunction. Senescence is a state of cell cycle arrest that also features mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid\naccumulation, and a highly inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This SASP is\ncurrently thought to be one of the primary causes of senescence-associated tissue dysfunction. The SASP,\nconsisting of cytokines/chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and lipid-derived eicosanoids, promotes chronic\ninflammation and dysfunction in neighboring cells. To date, research in this area has mainly focused on\ndetrimental effects of secreted SASP proteins, leaving the lipid/eicosanoid contribution to SASP and\nsenescence largely unstudied.\nSenescent cells characteristically accumulate lipid droplets (LDs), which have recently been identified as central\nnodes in the inflammatory response and as sites for eicosanoid production. LD metabolism can either contribute\nto or protect against inflammation depending on the composition of proteins residing on the LD surface. One\nsuch protein, Perilipin 2 (PLIN2), has been shown to play pivotal roles in multiple inflammatory conditions and\ncan regulate the efflux of inflammatory lipids from the LD. My primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms\nby which LDs and LD proteins modulate senescence, which could allow for specific targeting of this inflammatory\nprocess. My central hypothesis is that PLIN2 plays a key role in the initiation and maintenance of SASP\nand senescence. We will test this hypothesis by establishing a mechanism by which PLIN2 interacts with\neicosanoid synthesizing enzymes in senescence and regulates eicosanoid release from the LD. Then we will\nshow that PLIN2 knockout in senescent cells in aged mice attenuates global inflammation, reduces the SASP in\nsenescent cells, and enhances healthspan of aged mice. No study to date has investigated a role for PLIN2 in\nsenescence. This proposal will lay the groundwork establishing PLIN2 and the LD as central to senescence and\nSASP, thus unveiling a novel mechanism by which senescence contributes to aging.",

Dr.\nLee will achieve this goal by conducting an innovative research project and career development activities that\nare aligned with her career goals. The proposed research will evaluate a summertime, community-based child\nnutrition assistance program, the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), funded by the United States\nDepartment of Agriculture. This program addresses the nutritional gap of increased food insecurity that low-\nincome children experience during the summer months by providing meals to children at program sites.\nHowever, nutritional guidelines of the program are not as comprehensive as other nutrition assistance\nprograms, which may contribute to weight gain among children from low-income households who are\ndisproportionately affected by childhood obesity. Additionally, the program sites vary in operation length and\nthe extent to which there is additional healthy programming beyond the provision of foods. Lastly,\ncharacteristics of program participants as well as the program\u2019s impact on child diet quality and weight are not\nwell documented. Without this knowledge, it is challenging to characterize what works and for whom and\nidentify targets for optimizing the SFSP and for future interventions. The proposed research will conduct a\nprospective observational study to describe program site and participant characteristics at baseline to evaluate\nthe current program implementation (Aim 1) and determine if the site and participant characteristics are\nassociated with child program attendance and changes in food insecurity, diet quality and weight gain (Aims 2\nand 3). Two cohorts of elementary school-aged children and their parents (n=210) recruited through SFSP\nsites in Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota will participate in data collection before and in the final\nweeks of the program (spring and end of summer, respectively). Data collection components include an online\npsychosocial survey, three 24-hour dietary recalls, and measurement of height, weight and percent body fat.\nAdditionally, parents will report program usage weekly during the program. A multi-disciplinary team of mentors\nat the University of Minnesota will guide the proposed project and career development activities. Training areas\ninclude: a) health equity approaches in reducing food insecurity and weight gain (Drs. Jayne Fulkerson and\nLisa Harnack), b) advanced statistical skills for use in evaluation of the long-term impacts of public health\nprograms (Dr. Weihua Guan), c) implementation science and intervention development (Dr. Nancy Sherwood)\nand d) collaborations with community partners (Drs. Jayne Fulkerson and Lisa Harnack). The project and\ntraining plan will position Dr. Lee to advance her career as an independent investigator while contributing to the\nmission of the NIH by reducing weight-related health disparities of children living in low-income households.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary \nHypoglycemia is a serious complication of diabetes resulting from insulin treatment which can lead to cognitive deficits, brain damage, loss of consciousness, and death. A primary response to hypoglycemia is an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF). We will test the novel hypothesis that astrocytes contribute to hypoglycemia-induced CBF increases by simultaneously monitoring astrocyte Ca2+ signaling and blood vessel diameter in the mouse cortex as blood glucose is lowered by insulin administration. We will also test whether activity-dependent increases in CBF (neurovascular coupling) is reduced during hypoglycemia and during the course of diabetes. \nAim 1. Test the hypothesis that astrocytes mediate hypoglycemia-induced vessel dilation. The relation between blood glucose, astrocyte Ca2+ signaling, and vessel diameter will be determined as blood glucose is lowered by insulin administration in wildtype mice and in IP3R2 KO mice, where astrocyte Ca2+ signaling is reduced. \nAim 2. Test the hypothesis that adenosine evokes Ca2+ increases in astrocytes and the release of vasodilating prostaglandins (PGs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) during hypoglycemia. We will test the hypothesis that adenosine dilation of vessels acts in part by stimulating astrocytes and evoking astrocyte Ca2+ increases. PGs and EETs are released from astrocytes and dilate cerebral vessels. We will test whether one or both of these astrocyte vasodilators contribute to hypoglycemia-induced vessel dilation.  \nAim 3. Determine whether neurovascular coupling is altered during hypoglycemia. Increases in neuronal activity evoke local increases in CBF. This response, termed neurovascular coupling, supplies active neurons with needed glucose and oxygen. We will test whether vessel dilation evoked by whisker stimulation is altered during hypoglycemia in healthy mice.  \nAim 4. Test the hypothesis that neurovascular coupling is altered during hypoglycemia in a mouse model of diabetes. Aim 3 experiments will be repeated in diabetic Akita mice. These mice have been subjected to chronic hyperglycemia and represent a more accurate model of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetic patients. \nAim 5. Test the hypothesis that neurovascular coupling is altered during the course of long-term hyperglycemia as experienced in the Akita mouse model of diabetes. Cognitive decline is a serious and widespread complication of diabetes and may be caused, in part, by altered CBF regulation. We will determine whether neurovascular coupling is compromised during the course of diabetes in a longitudinal study in the Akita mouse.",

    "abstract_text": "Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments. Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established based on a sufficiently large and demographically heterogeneous sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the Healthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Consortium has been formed to deploy a harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,200 mothers and infants enrolled at 27 sites across the United States (US). The HBCD Study will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD Consortium Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD Data Coordinating Center (HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD Study is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a varied cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant woman with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD Study will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-of-the-art methods. The HBCD Study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of children across the nation. This study is part of the NIH\u2019s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThis project combines the mutual expertise of Drs. Patrick Rothwell and Swati More (Principal Investigators) in\nnucleus accumbens opioid signaling and medicinal chemistry. As part of an ongoing collaboration supported by\nNIDA (R21 DA050120), we have found that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has a non-canonical function\nin the nucleus accumbens: it degrades Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (MERF) and thereby regulates endogenous\nopioid signaling. Conventional ACE inhibitors block the degradation of MERF, leading to an enhancement of\nendogenous opioid signaling in the nucleus accumbens. This causes a selective reduction of glutamate release\nonto medium spiny projection neurons that express the Drd1 dopamine receptor (D1-MSNs), which express ACE\nat a higher level than other neurons. This mechanism of action has great therapeutic potential, as our preliminary\ndata indicate the decrease in excitatory drive to D1-MSNs can diminish the rewarding effects of fentanyl.\nPreviously published enzymatic assays using recombinant protein suggest that MERF is efficiently degraded by\nthe catalytic N-domain of ACE, though this has not been examined in brain tissue. This raises the exciting\npossibility of a double-dissociation between catalytic domains of ACE that degrade angiotensin (C-domain) and\nMERF (N-domain). The goal of this project is to independently evaluate the contribution of each ACE catalytic\ndomain to MERF degradation and endogenous opioid signaling in the nucleus accumbens, in order to generate\nnew domain-specific ACE inhibitors with optimized properties for treatment of opioid use disorders. We will use\nmice as an experimental system to separately manipulate each catalytic domain of ACE, through a combination\nof complementary genetic and pharmacological manipulations. AIM 1 is to determine which catalytic domain\nof ACE degrades MERF in nucleus accumbens tissue. We will directly quantify extracellular levels of MERF\nusing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and measure excitatory synaptic transmission using\nwhole-cell patch-clamp recordings from nucleus accumbens neurons. AIM 2 is to determine the behavioral\nimpact of domain-specific ACE inhibition on fentanyl CPP and self-administration. This will build on our\npreliminary experiments using non-contingent fentanyl exposure (CPP), by incorporating parallel analysis of\nintravenous fentanyl self-administration on an intermittent access schedule. AIM 3 is to optimize the central\nactivity and drug-like properties of domain-specific ACE inhibitors. We will perform systematic chemical\niterations involving (but not limited to) prodrug and drug delivery systems, with the goal of improving permeability\nacross the blood-brain barrier. These experiments should result in the identification and early optimization of\ncompounds that inhibit degradation of MERF by ACE in the brain. This novel mechanism could form the basis\nof a viable new therapeutic strategy for treating opioid use disorders.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nCardiovascular tissue engineering with pluripotent stem cells has emerged as a means to generate human\ncardiac tissues that can be used to model myocardial function and disease or for clinical implantation. However,\nexisting tissue models are limited by low thickness and a lack of structural and functional maturity, due to the\npoor proliferative capacity, maturation, and embryonic-like phenotypes of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes\n(CMs). During mammalian development, the epicardium provides critical signals to the myocardium, enabling\nventricular compaction by secreting pro-mitogenic factors and contributing coronary vascular smooth muscle\ncells (CVSMCs) and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) to the heart. While these cells can be harnessed to improve\nproliferation and maturation of CMs in vitro, there is a limited understanding of the underlying cellular\nmechanisms that drive these effects in human cells. In this proposal, we seek to elucidate the intermediate\nsignals driving human epicardial-myocardial interactions by developing a 3D printed cardiac tissue model with a\nfunctional epicardial cell layer, utilizing CMs and epicardial progenitor cells (EPCs) derived from human induced\npluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). This laminated 3D-tissue model is designed to enable EPCs to undergo\nepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migrate into the tissue bulk, and also provides a unique\nenvironment to probe ECM remodeling by epicardial derived cells (EPDCs), a process we hypothesize is one of\nthe key mechanisms by which these cells drive maturation of cardiac tissue. Utilizing gene editing and high-\nthroughput proteomic analysis, we will identify EPC-secreted growth factors that promote hiPSC-CM proliferation\nas well as EPDC-secreted ECM proteins that are critical to structural and functional maturation of cardiac tissue.\nWe will then incorporate an epicardial layer onto a more geometrically complex model - a 3D printed, human\nchambered myocardial pump. We will investigate the impact of the epicardium with and without imposed\nvolumetric pressure on pump function and clinical parameters like stroke work and ejection fraction. Insights\ngained from this work will expand our knowledge of developmental processes and propel the next generation of\nengineered cardiac tissues. These studies will, for the first time, elucidate details of epicardial-myocardial\nsignaling in a human model and establish a link between EPDC ECM secretion and cardiac tissue maturation.\nAdditionally, these studies will advance the structure and function of a clinically relevant myocardial pump model\nthat has the potential to be used for drug testing, device testing, and modeling of diseases \u2013 especially those\nthat manifest in altered pressure-volume dynamics",

    "abstract_text": "Premise: The combination of selectivity and affinity afforded by biomolecules such as antibodies for their target\nligands make them ideal recognition elements for bioassays. While these affinity reagents have enabled the\ndevelopment of many important bioassays, these measurements are almost always performed as static analyses\nat an individual time point. The slow off rates of affinity reagents makes development of responsive assays that\ncan monitor changes in analyte concentration over time a challenge. Reagent degradation, non-specific surface\ninteractions, and biofouling present additional difficulties. Our goal is to develop an online, flow-through, affinity\nassay that can continuously monitor the efflux of biochemical messengers from dynamically changing biological\nsystems in real time. Our premise is that microfluidic integration of a perfusion chamber, online mixing of affinity\nreagents and continuous micro free flow electrophoresis (\u00b5FFE) separations will directly address limitations that\nhave restricted the development of time responsive affinity-based assays to date.\nInnovation: We will use a microfluidic, flow through approach to develop time responsive affinity assays. The\nbiological model (i.e., cell culture) will be housed in a perfusion chamber. Perfusate will be mixed online with a\nfluorescently labeled affinity reagent (i.e., antibody or aptamer) that selectively binds the target analyte. Online\n\u00b5FFE will then be used to continuously separate the analyte-affinity reagent complex from excess affinity reagent\nin real time. Online affinity \u00b5FFE offers several advantages. Continuous flow removes off rate as a limitation to\ntemporal response. Exposure to the biological matrix is minimal, mitigating reagent degradation. Signal is\nmeasured in solution, limiting the effect of non-specific surface interactions and biofouling. \u00b5FFE separation\nenables interference free measurement of the analyte-affinity reagent complex even when the affinity reagent is\napplied in large excess, improving the LOD of the assay.\nApproach: Affinity \u00b5FFE assays will be developed for representative analytes from three biochemical\nmessenger systems: neuropeptide Y (NPY, neurotransmission), leptin (energy regulation), and tumor necrosis\nfactor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1, immune response). Direct comparisons will be made between assays that use antibodies (Aim\n#1) or aptamers (Aim #2) as the affinity reagent. Figures of merit that will be used to assess assay performance\ninclude: LOD, temporal response, minimum detectable change, and long-term stability. Once fully optimized,\naffinity \u00b5FFE assays will be used to continuously monitor both baseline and stimulated efflux from cell models\nfor neurotransmission (neurons), energy regulation (adipocytes) and immune response (mast cells).\nBenchmarks: We anticipate that affinity \u00b5FFE will achieve the following performance metrics: LOD \u2264 1nM;\ntemporal response \u2264 1 s; minimum detectable change \u2264 5%; and long-term stability \u2264 10% over 4 h.\nImpact: Time responsive \u00b5FFE assays will allow researchers to study dynamic changes that occur on a \u22641 s\ntimescale in several critical biochemical messenger systems for the first time.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY\nDendritic cells (DC) are responsible for directing T cell responses and macrophages important for modulating\ntissue inflammation. A hallmark of these immune cells is their inherent plasticity to govern immunity vs. tolerance.\nHowever, much remains unknown regarding the complex molecular networks that collectively govern\nhematopoiesis, inflammation and antigen presentation. Incomplete understanding presents major obstacles to\ndelineating their underlying roles in health and disease, which has also hindered success in developing effective\nimmunotherapies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to determine how pivotal immunoregulatory\nproteins govern DC and macrophage differentiation and immune responses. Published findings by my laboratory\nhave begun to mechanistically define the functional roles of several important genes uniquely expressed in these\nmyeloid cells. These genes, which include Allograft Inflammatory Factor-1 (AIF1) and Phosphodiesterase 1b\n(Pde1b), among others, were identified using a combination of high throughput transcriptomic profiling coupled\nwith rigorous RNAi functional screening. My laboratory demonstrated that AIF1 is selectively expressed in\nconventional type 1 DC (cDC1), monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) and macrophages and serves as a scaffold to\nrecruit protein kinase C (PKC) in a calcium-responsive manner to promote inflammation and type 1 polarized\nimmune responses. Furthermore, AIF1 expression was required for successful generation of cDC1 from\nhematopoietic progenitors and both MoDC and macrophages from monocyte precursors. In the context of\ndisease, AIF1 expression in DC and macrophages is required for initiating and sustaining insulitis and in\nregulating effector responses to intracellular pathogens. In another line of studies, the phosphodiesterase protein\nPde1b was found to depress protein kinase A (PKA) activity in a calcium-dependent manner by regulating\ncyclonucleotide levels in cDC1, MoDC and macrophages to promote immune effector responses. Thus, my\nresearch group has begun to unravel how Pde1b works in concert with AIF1 to govern immunity by balancing\nPKC vs. PKA activities. As important as these initial findings are, there remains several gaps in understanding\nthe molecular mechanics of how these genes govern immunobiology. As such, our research builds on prior\nstudies by now employing conditional and global knockout mice and use of innovative experimental tools to\nrigorously study mechanistic roles in vivo. My laboratory will pursue the following major goals over the next five\nyears: (1) delineate how AIF1 and Pde1B govern differentiation of DC and macrophages in vivo; (2) describe the\nintracellular processes by which other key novel immunoregulatory genes orchestrate immune responses; (3)\ndetermine the contributing role of AIF1 in initiating inflammation and sustaining autoreactive T cell responses;\nand (4) identify how intracellular pathogens antagonize AIF1 and Pde1b through disruption of calcium signaling\nand cyclonucleotide levels to evade host immunity. Knowledge gained will fill key gaps in our understanding of\nDC and macrophage biology and provide important insights into the molecular networks governing immunity.",

The Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) pay MA plans a monthly capitated rate to cover nearly all health care\nexpenses for plan enrollees.

In addition, CMS grants MA plans greater freedom to manage enrollees\u2019 health care use, for example,\nthrough tools such as narrow provider networks and broader coverage of delivery innovations such as\ntelemedicine. Proponents argue that these financial incentives and effective tools for MA plans might enable\nthem to provide care more efficiently than TM.

Gi-signaling is used to perform process outgrowth, while Gs signaling is engaged during periods of\nneuronal hypoactivity (such as anesthesia). However, very little is known about microglial Gq calcium signaling.\nPartially, this is due to the fact that microglia rarely display calcium transients at rest. On the other hand, microglia\ngreatly elevate their calcium signaling in the period that follows status epilepticus\u2014a prolonged seizure state\npredictive of later epilepsy development. The purpose of microglial calcium signaling during epilepsy\ndevelopment is not known, but is hypothesized to be a component of microglial phagocytosis. Most microglial\ncalcium signaling in epilepsy development is attributable to P2Y6 receptor signaling\u2014a Gq-calcium receptor\nactivated by a key purine. P2Y6 is best described for its role in phagocytosis, but that has not been fully explored\nin epilepsy development. (Innovation) The current proposal will utilize a novel mouse line that allows for the\nsimultaneous examination of microglial calcium activity and process movement in the living animal (using two-\nphoton microscopy). (Aim 1) This line will be used to test the role of P2Y6 in microglial phagocytosis, after\nneurons are selectively killed through excitotoxicity using optogenetic techniques. In parallel, tissue studies will\nbe conducted across key time points in epilepsy development to determine if the loss of the P2Y6 pathway\nprevents proper clearance of dead/dying neurons after status epilepticus.

We will determine the long-term pro-inflammatory effects of P2Y6 signaling loss.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\nOver 100 million US adults have hypertension, the number one chronic disease risk factor in the world. The\nUnited States Preventive Services Task Force and the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart\nAssociation blood pressure (BP) guidelines recommends measuring BP outside of the clinic for the diagnosis\nand management of hypertension. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) involves self-measurement of BP\nby the patient and is the most common method for assessing out-of-office BP in the US. The guideline\nrecommendations are based on high-quality observational studies in which out-of-office BP was typically\nobtained at a single point and individuals with high out-of-office BP were observed to have higher rates of\ncardiovascular outcomes and increased rates of all-cause mortality, regardless of office BP levels. Additionally,\nclinical trials have demonstrated that HBPM reduces clinic BP over short 6-12 month time frames, especially\nwhen combined with disease management programs. There are no studies evaluating the effectiveness of\nHBPM in routine clinical practice in a diverse population from across the country. Additionally, there are a lack\nof data on: a) whether use of HBPM reduces risk for clinical outcomes; b) the impact of HBPM on both short-\nand long-term clinic BP, clinical inertia, and medication adherence in routine clinical practice; and c) how\nclinicians and patients utilize HBPM. Over the last ~10 years, approximately 400,000 Veterans have measured\nhome BPs as part of the VA\u2019s telehealth program. We propose to identify Veterans age 18-90 years with\nuncontrolled clinic BP enrolled in HBPM programs and a cohort of Veterans not enrolled in HBPM programs.\nWe will link telehealth data to clinical and outcome data. The proposal will make use of the large number of\npatients enrolled in the VA\u2019s HBPM program and the variation in how the HBPM program is implemented\nacross VA sites. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effect of HBPM on major adverse cardiovascular events, non-\ncancer mortality, and adverse events. In Aim 2, we will assess the impact of HBPM on clinic BP, BP\nmedication intensification, and medication adherence. In Aim 3, we will determine facility-, provider-, and\npatient-level factors associated with use of HBPM in routine practice. Results will establish a) the long-term\nbenefits of HBPM, b) the association between HBPM and clinical events, and c) the effects in important\nsubgroups. These findings will inform selection of patients for and the design of a much-needed randomized\ncontrolled trial evaluating the effect of HBPM on clinical outcomes compared to office-based hypertension\nmanagement. Additionally, identifying factors associated with greater reductions in BP and greater number of\nhome BP values transmitted, such as case management programs, may identify barriers to adherence that can\nbe addressed and inform implementation strategies and the use of HBPM in clinical practice. The proposed\nstudy will answer questions critically important to implementation of HBPM in routine clinical practice with the\nultimate goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension.",

Developmental science\nshows that variation in adult physical and cognitive health is reliably associated with individuals\u2019 early\nexperiences in their families of origin. Risky families, characterized by greater conflict and lower-quality\nparenting, tend to disrupt psychosocial and biological functioning, resulting in increased risk for diseases,\nincluding Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Children who receive less warmth, support, and\nresponsiveness from their parents typically have higher inflammation levels, blood pressure, and allostatic load,\nindicators that predict future cardiovascular problems. These pathways are also implicated in altered midlife\ncognitive functioning and confer risk for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). This project takes\nadvantage of an unparalleled opportunity to further this important line of work on the significance of family\nexperiences in adolescence for health outcomes in adulthood by conducting a follow-up into midlife of the Sibling\nInteraction and Behavior Study (SIBS). SIBS is a longitudinal study of 409 adoptive and 208 non-adoptive\nfamilies. The offspring in these families have already completed intake (in mid-adolescence), and three follow-\nup assessments. In the first assessment of SIBS, already coded direct observations of parent-child interactions,\nas well as parent-reports and child-reports of the quality of the parent-child relationship, were acquired. The\navailability of these relationship data at a key developmental phase in an adoption cohort provides a strong\nplatform for the addition of follow-up data on the target participants/younger generation (YG; M age = 38 years)\nand their parents/older generation (OG; M age = 71 years). Our overarching objective is to investigate the degree\nto which family experiences in adolescence predict key indicators of health in adulthood among adoptive and\nnon-adoptive adults and their aging parents.

Variation in late-life\nadult cognitive health is associated with adverse interpersonal experiences (AIEs, e.g.,\nloneliness), although documenting the full extent of this association requires further study of a\ngreater diversity of AIEs.

Although some disease-specific Tau modifications have\nbeen identified, many are conserved across the full range of tauopathies. We do not yet have a deep\nunderstanding of the molecular processes that generate these tau protein modifications, or of their functional\nconsequences in promoting pathogenic cascades. This knowledge gap is a major contributor to our current\ninability to generate effective therapeutic interventions for AD and other tauopathies. The central hypothesis we\nare testing here is that a range of pathogenic events induce phosphorylation of tau at specific residues, resulting\nin mislocalization of tau within the cell and subsequent synaptic dysfunctions, and that inhibition of these early\ntau phosphorylation events will in turn inhibit tau pathologies and associated signaling deficits. This hypothesis\nis based on our published work, primarily utilizing cultured cell experimental systems. The direct relevance of\nthis mechanism to human disease is further supported by the recent finding that phosphorylation of tau at these\nsame specific residues is an early event preceding tau fibril formation in AD disease progression. Our overall\nobjective here is to test and further refine this hypothesis in a novel mouse model we have developed (MAPT-\nGR) that expresses all isoforms of human tau at physiologic levels and ratios. We have found that mild traumatic\nbrain injury (mTBI) induces a rapid phosphorylation and somatodendritic mislocalization of the human tau in\nthese mice. Importantly, we can prevent this tau mislocalization by inhibiting phosphorylation. The specific aims\nare to: 1. Determine the dynamic changes in the subcellular distribution of phosphorylated tau. We will\nutilize our novel tauopathy model to test the working hypothesis that phosphorylation of tau at specific residues\nleads to somatodendritic accumulation of tau, tau mislocalization to dendritic spines, and alters micro-\ncomponents of dendritic spines. 2. Determine the synaptic and circuit dysfunctions associated with the\nphosphorylation of tau. We will test the working hypothesis that mislocalization of phosphorylated tau to\nsomatodendritic domains and dendritic spines results in synaptic and circuit dysfunction in our model. 3. Identify\nthe impact of inhibiting these early phosphorylation events on tau mislocalization and associated\nsignaling deficits. We will test our working hypothesis that mTBI activates GSK3\u03b2 and CDK5, which\nphosphorylate the B and C domain of the tau protein. Expected Outcomes: We expect to identify the early-stage\npathologies and dysfunctions caused by phosphorylation of tau and provide proof-of-concept demonstrations of\nthe extent to which these dysfunctions can be prevented by blocking tau phosphorylation at specific residues.\nOf equal importance, we expect to have optimized a model and experimental platform in which potential\ntherapeutic compounds that target this common disease mechanism can be tested and optimized.",

Thus, the\nelderly population usually has multiple chronic conditions at the same time, resulting in poor health and reduced\nquality of life (prolonged morbidity period) at the later stage of life. There is a big challenge to compress morbidity\nperiod and increase healthspan (lifespan with good health). In this project, we propose to examine the role of\np21high senescent cells in lifespan and healthspan. We have generated and validated a new p21-Cre transgenic\nmouse model containing a p21 promoter driving a bicistronic message consisting of Cre fused to a tamoxifen-\ninducible estrogen receptor (ER) element. This model enables us to monitor, sort, kill or modulate p21high cells\nwith aging in vivo. Our preliminary data shows that p21high and p16high cells are two distinct cell populations, and\nthe p21-Cre mouse model targets 1.5-10% of cells in various tissues in 23-month-old mice. Monthly clearance\nof p21high cells in mice starting at 20 months reduces frailty index, extends lifespan, and more importantly,\nimproves physical function at the end of life. In this proposal, we will further characterize the role and mechanisms\nof p21high cells in lifespan and healthspan. Our overarching hypothesis is that targeting p21high cells can extend\nlifespan and compress morbidity in old age. In aim 1.1, we will investigate whether clearance of p21high cells\ncould extend lifespan and healthspan using a larger group size. We will examine potential sex difference and\nperform postmortem pathological analysis to examine the cause of death and disease burden. Moreover, we will\nfollow physical function and frailty index of these mice every month from 20-month-old to the end of life to assess\nlate life health status. In aim 1.2, we will leverage p21-Cre mouse models to sort and enrich p21high cells from 6\ntissues of 23-month-old mice where we observed p21high cells (2-10%), and perform single cell RNA sequencing\non these cells along with non-p21high cells. In addition, we will perform single nucleus sequencing and imaging\nmass cytometry. In aim 2, we will investigate the role of NF-\u03baB pathway in p21high cells in lifespan and healthspan\nshortening. This project is likely to have a broad impact on aging research by gaining a comprehensive\nunderstanding of p21high cells at both functional and transcriptomic levels in vivo. Results from this project will\nalso enable future testing of pharmacological interventions that eliminate these cells to improve lifespan and\ncompress morbidity.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nMyelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a heterogenous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders, are an\nacquired bone marrow failure syndrome. MDS is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis resulting in\nperipheral blood cytopenia and progenitor expansion. Genes encoding for RNA splicing factors (U2AF1, SF3B1,\nSRSF2, and ZRSR2) are frequently mutated and occur in the founding clones of MDS, representing a unique\nclass of genetic vulnerability for targeted therapy. However, despite the prevalence of spliceosome mutations,\nhow such mutations impact different cellular mechanisms are largely unclear. Recent studies by us and others\nsuggest that R-loops, a group of transcription intermediates containing RNA:DNA hybrids and displaced single-\nstranded DNA, are a source of genomic instability induced by different spliceosome mutants. In the preliminary\nstudies leading to this application, we find that PARP1 is activated by R-loops and it plays a key role in\nsuppressing R-loop-associated DNA damage. Furthermore, we show that MDS-associated RNA splicing factor\nmutations promote R-loop accumulation and render cells sensitive to PARP inhibition. These exciting findings\nlead us to hypothesize that PARP1 is a key sensor of R-loops and a critical suppressor of R-loop-associated\nDNA damage. Furthermore, aberrant R-loop accumulation represents a new targetable vulnerability in MDS-\nassociated splicing factor mutant cells, making PARP inhibition an attractive way to target R-loop vulnerability in\nMDS. Finally, since PARP inhibitors achieved limited FDA approval in different diseases, repurposing PARP\ninhibitors to treat MDS patients harboring RNA splicing factor mutations may provide the fastest route to translate\nour findings to the clinics. To test these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will elucidate mechanisms by which PARP1 is\nactivated by R-loops. In Aim 2, we will identify global PARP1 substrates and R-loop distribution landscape in\nU2AF1-mutant cells, providing a proteomic and genomic view of how PARP1 regulates R-loops. In Aim 3, we\nwill evaluate whether PARP inhibitor, olaparib, can selectively eliminate MDS-associated splicing mutant cells in\nvitro and in vivo. Together, these studies will mechanistically explain how R-loops are sensed by PARP1 in\nsplicing mutant cells, reveal how PARP1 guards cells against R-loop-associated genomic instability, and address\nwhether R-loop-associated vulnerability in spliceosome-mutant MDS cells can be exploited by PARP inhibitors\nas targeted MDS therapy. The combined expertise in R-loops, PARP1, DNA damage response and spliceosome\nmutations in MDS (Nguyen laboratory), PARP regulation by proteomic approach (Leung laboratory, co-I), and\nMDS GEMM mouse models of U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations (Lee laboratory, co-I) provides us the unique\nopportunity to characterize PARP1 function in cells expressing MDS-associated mutations. These studies will\nnot only significantly advance our understanding of R-loop biology and PARP1 signaling, but also repurpose the\nuse of FDA-approved PARP inhibitors in targeted therapy for MDS patients harboring RNA splicing factor\nmutations by exploiting R-loop-associated vulnerability.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nReversible serine/threonine phosphorylation of proteins plays an essential regulatory function in numerous\ncellular processes. Type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) comprise a major class of Ser/Thr phosphatases\n(PPases), and defects in several human PP2Cs have been implicated in cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular\ndisease, neural disorders, and stress signaling. However, major gaps exist in understanding how PP2C\nenzyme activity is regulated and what specific proteins and processes are under PP2C control. In plants,\nPP2C.D PPases inhibit organ growth by repressing cell expansion. In part, this is accomplished by\ndephosphorylation of a key regulatory phosphosite of plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPases. The growth\nhormone auxin stimulates cell expansion by inducing expression of Small Auxin Up RNA (SAUR) genes, which\nencode novel proteins that bind to PP2C.D PPases to inhibit enzymatic activity. The long-term goal of this\nproject is to thoroughly understand the molecular mechanisms underlying auxin-mediated control of plant\ngrowth and development. More specifically, the work described in this proposal will identify regulators and\ndownstream effectors of SAUR-PP2C.D signaling hubs involved in auxin-mediated cell expansion and the\nintegration of volumetric changes with diverse cellular processes to yield a coordinated growth response.\n Phosphoproteomic studies have identified >140 proteins exhibiting altered phosphorylation in response to\nauxin. This dataset overlaps substantially with phosphoproteins affected by SAUR overexpression, implicating\nSAUR-PP2C.D modules as major regulators of the auxin phosphorylome during cell expansion. Using the\npowerful genetic system of the model plant Arabidopsis, the proposed studies will investigate the functional\nroles of select phosphoprotein candidates in auxin-induced growth and their regulatory interactions with SAUR-\nPP2C.D modules. Detailed analysis of auxin\u2019s regulation of PM H+-ATPase activity will also be conducted.\nAuxin both inhibits H+-ATPase dephosphorylation via SAUR repression of PP2C.D activity and stimulates\nactivation by promoting ATPase phosphorylation by TMK1 and additional kinases, including orthologs of WNK\nand SPAK/OSR kinases implicated in mammalian cell size control. All of these kinases interact with one\nanother and PP2C.D PPases, and research will address how kinase and phosphatase activities are\ncoordinated and mutually regulated. This work will elucidate PP2C functions and regulatory mechanisms,\nidentify PP2C.D effectors that modulate cell expansion, and illuminate how auxin coordinates diverse cellular\nprocesses to control cell size. Given the conservation of PP2C function across kingdoms and the universal\nprocess of cell size control, project findings will have broad impact, including implications into human\ndevelopment and disease. Further, as humans depend on plants for sources of food, fiber, and\npharmaceuticals, the proposed studies will elucidate plant growth control by SAUR-PP2C.D regulatory\nmodules and facilitate novel strategies for manipulating plant growth to benefit human health.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nSocial isolation (SI) during childhood increases the susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety\ndisorders, depression, and cognitive impairments. Limited treatment for these disorders highlights the\nimportance of identifying new therapeutic targets. Recent evidence has underscored the role of the cerebellum\nin early-life stress. For example, the neonatal cerebellum contains the highest level of glucocorticoid receptor\n(GR) in the entire brain, indicating that the cerebellum is enriched in the molecular machinery for processing the\nstress response. The cerebellum is extensively connected to brain networks that are sensitive to psychological\nstress. However, whether and how SI stress regulates gene expression in the cerebellum to result in cerebellar\ndysfunction and maladaptive behaviors remain elusive. To address the knowledge gap, we isolated experimental\nmice in singly housed cages. They displayed behavioral changes reminiscent of high anxiety, depression, and\nsocial memory loss. Moreover, we found that SI impaired intrinsic excitability of Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole\noutput neurons in the cerebellar cortex. And cerebellar gene expression was highly responsive to stress stimuli\nsuch as an elevation of corticosterone, a stress hormone, in rodents. These findings fuel our central hypothesis\nthat SI impairs the cerebellar output activity by specifically affecting the intrinsic excitability of PCs; and restoring\nPC excitability rectifies SI-caused behavioral deficits via the cerebello-cortical networks. To test the hypothesis,\nwe propose a multidisciplinary approach with three specific aims: (1) Determine the molecular basis of reduced\nPC intrinsic excitability by SI. We will employ two genome-wide RNA sequencing techniques to obtain an\nunbiased view of transcriptional signatures and epigenetic modifications of SI as well as to identify SI-responsive\nion channels in PCs, e.g., Kv1.5. PC-specific knockout of GR will uncover the GR-dependent genomic\nreprogramming by SI. (2) Define the significance of PC activity in systemic response to SI. Using viral gene\ntransfer, we will gain precise spatiotemporal control of PC excitability to test the necessity and sufficiency of\ncerebellar activity in mediating the system-wide response to SI. (3) Specify the cerebellum-cortex gateways\nunderlying maladaptive behaviors of SI. Our efforts will be focused on dissecting the neural circuits that connect\nthe cerebellum to the downstream sub/cortical areas and their contributions to the behavioral phenotypes of SI.\nCompletion of this work will advance our understanding of the molecular, cellular and circuitry mechanisms\nunderpinning the non-conventional role of the cerebellum in the stress response, and the results will ultimately\nhelp develop novel therapeutic strategies to improve mental health.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nLocal sources of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) contribute significantly to disease risk;\nhowever, inability to differentiate local from non-local cases has precluded full characterization of local\ntransmission systems. The long-term goal of this research is to develop targeted public health interventions\nusing systems epidemiology to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms of STEC maintenance and\ntransmission. In pursuit of this goal, the overall objective of the current study is to identify characteristics of\npathogen, host, and environment associated with local STEC transmission. The central hypothesis is that\nSTEC cases infected from local sources are significantly different than those infected by strains from outside\nthe case\u2019s local area. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) differentiate and\ncharacterize locally transmitted STEC strains, both O157 and non-O157, 2) identify host characteristics\nassociated with acquiring local vs. non-local STEC strains, and 3) identify environmental characteristics\nassociated with local transmission. In aim 1, a structured coalescent phylodynamic model will be used to\ngenerate a phylogeny of STEC strains isolated from cases reported to the Minnesota Department of Health\n(MDH) since 2016 compared to strains isolated outside MN and available on NCBI. The inferred location of\ntree nodes will be used to classify STEC strains as local or non-local. A generalized linear model will be used to\nintegrate strain characteristics into the tree and determine their influence on the local MN STEC effective\npopulation size and migration rates. The second aim will assess the association of host characteristics,\nincluding age, sex, and potential exposures, with local vs. non-local STEC. In aim 3, the association between\ncharacteristics of the physical and social environment and local STEC transmission will be estimated\naccounting for spatial correlation. To accomplish these aims, PI Dr. Gillian Tarr will obtain advanced\ntraining in bioinformatics and phylodynamic modeling. Dr. Tarr will also enhance her knowledge of\nfood production and distribution systems and further develop her research management skills. With a long\nhistory of food safety research and collaboration with MDH, the University of Minnesota provides the optimal\nenvironment for this research. The mentorship team has expertise in bioinformatics and applied\nphylogenetic modeling and includes STEC and food systems subject matter experts. The proposed research is\ninnovative, in the applicants\u2019 opinions, because it will 1) characterize local transmission systems without\nrestriction to isolated outbreaks or use of proxies such as recent travel, and 2) employ a structured coalescent\nmodel that has not been applied for this purpose in any comparable disease system. Differentiating local\ntransmission from imported cases and identifying the host, pathogen, and environment characteristics of local\ntransmission is a significant contribution, because it enables specific hypotheses to be developed and tested\nfor local reservoirs and transmission pathways, which can then be targeted by tailored interventions.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nProstate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer related death in American men. Typically,\ntreatment for PCa involves blocking androgen synthesis or androgen receptor (AR) signaling known as\nandrogen deprivation therapy (ADT). Although initial response rates are promising, all men eventually progress\non ADT and develop castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) concomitant with metastatic burden.\nMetastatic CRPC is incurable and an increasing number of men are developing a highly lethal variant of CRPC\nknown as aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC). AR signaling is lost in AVPC rendering the existing\nhormone targeting treatments ineffective. About a third of AVPC tumors also express neuroendocrine (NE)\ngenes and are classified as neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), which is the focus of our studies. Very\nfew therapies exist and only offer minimal survival benefits in this setting. Hence, functional assessment of\nother protein drug targets is needed to effectively treat NEPC. We have previously shown that kinase signaling\npathways may be promising therapeutic alternatives in CRPC. The goal of our research is to understand the\nmechanisms regulating increased kinase gene expression, leading to kinase pathway activation, and how to\neffectively target these kinases in NEPC. Our hypothesis is that RET mRNA and protein up-regulation is driven\nby ASCL1, a master neural transcriptional regulator, and that RET kinase-mediated activity serves as a\ntherapeutic vulnerability in NEPC. It is known that RET mutations are key drivers and therapeutic targets in\nother cancers with NE features such as papillary thyroid carcinoma and small cell lung cancer. Importantly, the\ncontribution of RET kinase signaling in NEPC viability is not entirely elucidated. Our preliminary data shows\nthat RET kinase is overexpressed via activation of a neuronal differentiation transcription factor, ASCL1, and\nenzymatically activated in mouse models and organoids of NEPC, in human cell lines, and clinical NEPC\ntumors. Our work also shows that RET kinase inhibition reduces in vivo xenograft tumor growth and in in vitro\nmouse organoid models of NEPC. The goals of this project are to: 1) confirm ASCL1 as a direct transcriptional\nregulator of RET, 2) define a RET activity signature and assess the association of this signature to treatment\nresistance and NEPC in clinical samples, and 3) optimize co-targeting strategies with novel RET inhibitors in\nNEPC model systems. These goals are collectively designed to investigate the mechanism of RET kinase as a\nkey therapeutic target in NEPC, an incurable variant of PCa. While kinase inhibitors are approved for treatment\nof several epithelial cancers, clinical trials of kinase inhibitors in PCa have been disappointing. Our data\nindicate this is likely due to lack of appropriate patient stratification, administered in the wrong clinical context,\nand improper combination therapies. Hence, the outcomes of the proposed work will provide new insights into\nselect combination therapies for treating NEPC, using re-purposed kinase inhibitors that may be implemented\nquickly in clinical trials of patients with this subset of lethal PCa.",

    "abstract_text": "Alphaviruses, a group of enveloped RNA viruses, cause persistent arthritis and encephalitis among horses and humans. Currently, no licensed vaccine or antiviral therapy is available to prevent or cure the disease. A critical step in enveloped virus infection is membrane fusion between the viral and the host cellular membranes, a process leading to cytoplasmic delivery of the viral genome. Alphaviruses enter the host cell via receptor- mediated endocytosis. The viral E1 protein mediates membrane fusion through conformational changes upon acidification in the early endosomes. The other viral envelope protein, E2, functions as a molecular chaperon for the E1 protein during virus assembly and plays a role in virus capsid core uptake at the budding site and release after membrane fusion. We have obtained exciting, unprecedented images that captured robust alphavirus membrane fusion events with target liposomes by cryo-electron microscopy. Using coordinated biochemical, biophysical, cryo-electron microscopy, and cryo-electron tomography methods, we will investigate the molecular structures of the E1 and E2 proteins in a prototype alphavirus, Sindbis virus, at specific fusion stages. We will test specific predictions about the alphavirus membrane fusion mechanism based on our structural results by generating and characterizing mutants of the glycoproteins. We will test the fusion function of key mutations in the context of recombinant viruses. Completing this research will advance our understanding about how alphavirus glycoproteins promote membrane fusion.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nSystemic and structural racism is a public health crisis. However, little is known about the impact of\nstructural racism and discrimination (SRD) on the health and emotional well-being of individuals across the life\ncourse. While prior studies have shown associations between discrimination and negative health outcomes in\nadults (e.g., cardiometabolic disease, depression), these studies have been cross-sectional and primarily\nexamined individual-level sources of racism and discrimination. Much more research is needed to fill gaps\nin our understanding about the relationship between SRD and health disparities before interventions\ncan be developed. To significantly advance the field regarding SRD and health equity, studies need to\ninclude: (1) multi-level measures of SRD including individual (both intrapersonal and interpersonal),\nneighborhood, institutional, and societal/policy levels; (2) rigorous mixed-methods designs (e.g., ecological\nmomentary assessment (EMA), biological measures, geographic information system (GIS) data, surveys); (3)\nmulti-site samples with urban and rural participants; (4) a life course approach; (5) whole-person outcome\nmeasures (i.e., mental, physical, behavioral health); and (6) longitudinal study designs. Including these study\nelements will allow for comprehensively examining the relationships between SRD and health and emotional\nwell-being to identify mechanisms to target in interventions to mitigate SRD. The main objective of the\nproposed study is to examine multiple levels (i.e., individual, neighborhood, institutional,\nsocietal/policy) of SRD and associations with mental, physical, and behavioral health outcomes across\nthe life course to identify intervention targets to promote health equity. The proposed study is built on a\nprospective longitudinal cohort study of 627 racially/ethnically diverse families (i.e., African American, Hispanic,\nNative American, Immigrant/Refugee, White) across the life course (childhood, adolescence,\nadulthood/parenthood) from urban settings (i.e., Minneapolis, St. Paul). The parent R01 already has three\ntime-points of mixed-methods data (i.e., EMA, GIS, survey) that includes discrimination and neighborhood\nsegregation measures and physical and behavioral health outcomes carried out using a community-based\nparticipatory approach. For the proposed study, a sample of 300 racially/ethnically diverse families from rural\nGeorgia (i.e., Athens) will be added to compare SRD experiences in urban versus rural settings. In addition,\ncardiometabolic and stress biomarker data (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure, waist circumference, lipids, HbA1C,\ncytokines) and multi-level measures of structural racism (i.e., individual, neighborhood, institutional,\nsocietal/policy) will be added at two time points, 18 months apart. The proposed study will be one of the first to\nprospectively measure multiple levels of SRD using mixed-methods across two sites and associations with\nmental, physical, and behavioral health disparities across the life course in diverse families. Results of the\nstudy will inform the development of an intervention targeting multi-level SRDs to promote health equity.",

Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID)\u2014a primary type of\nADRD\u2014is a major research focus for the NIH, which has called for the need for studies of prevention across\nthe lifespan and in diverse populations (ADRD summit 2019). Underrecognized but relevant to VCID, prior\nresearch indicates that arrhythmias are associated with lower cognitive function and greater risk of AD/ADRD.\nHowever, current knowledge of arrhythmias\u2019 neurocognitive impact is lacking in the fastest growing ethnic\ngroup in the USA\u2014Hispanics/Latinos\u2014who are anticipated to contribute disproportionately to the projected\nincrease in prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ADRD. Thus, robust and comprehensive data\non prevalence and neurocognitive impact of arrhythmias in Hispanics/Latinos are critically needed.\nFurthermore, from a prevention standpoint, although prior research shows that modifiable lifestyle and\ncardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are related to ADRD risk and arrhythmia risk and burden, it is\nunknown whether optimizing lifestyle/CVD risk factors can mitigate the arrhythmia-ADRD relationship. To\naddress the foregoing knowledge gaps, we will apply the Zio\uf6daXT Patch\u2014a non-invasive ambulatory continuous\nECG monitor\u2014to ~5,000 participants (age \u226545 years) in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of\nLatinos (HCHS/SOL) in 2022-24 (concurrent with Visit 3) and leverage the rich data in HCHS/SOL and related\nancillary studies: neurocognitive assessment, adjudicated MCI and ADRD, brain MRI, cardiac MRI,\nlifestyle/CVD risk factors including 7-day accelerometer-based physical activity, adiposity measures, and blood\npressure. We hypothesize that in Hispanic/Latino adults, higher arrhythmia frequency will be associated with\nhigher incidence of MCI or ADRD, greater cognitive decline, more brain infarcts and small vessel ischemic\ndisease, and lower brain volumes. These associations will be independent of CVD and cardiac\nstructure/function and will be more evident in those with less optimal (vs. more optimal) lifestyle/CVD risk factor\ntrajectories. We will evaluate these aims: Aim 1: Define the prevalence and frequency of arrhythmias in\nHispanic/Latino adults using ambulatory heart rhythm monitoring, Aim 2: Evaluate the association of\narrhythmias with change in cognitive function and incident MCI or ADRD, Aim 3: Assess the association of\narrhythmias with markers of vascular brain injury based on brain MRI. Importantly, for each Aim, we will\nexamine the consistency of associations by antecedent 10-year lifestyle/CVD risk factor trajectories. This\nproject will combine exceptional and complementary scientific expertise, wearable and imaging technology,\nrigorous epidemiological and analytical methods, and leverage an existing NIH cohort to refine the VCID\nparadigm and overcome critical barriers in AD/ADRD and minority health research, thus achieving a sustained\nand powerful impact on public health and clinical practice.",

Of paramount importance is unraveling the regulatory roles\nof genetic variants on genes and gene-to-gene regulatory relationships. On this ground, biomedical researchers\ncan identify causal Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes for complex traits and neurodegenerative\ndiseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) to develop treatment strategies. Given the urgent need to under-\nstand the progression and etiology of these diseases, particularly AD, the PIs propose to develop statistical and\ncomputational tools for accurate estimation and inference of gene regulatory networks, with a focus on AD and\nother complex traits.\n The project consists of two major components: estimation and inference of gene regulatory networks with\nSNPs as instrumental variables (IVs). The main thrust will be on causal network reconstruction and inference\nwith IVs as interventions in the possible presence of invalid IVs and hidden confounders, with particular effort\non high-dimensional data, in which the number of variables may exceed the sample size. Concerning causal\nnetwork reconstruction, the project will develop novel methods of reconstructing gene regulatory networks as\ndirected acyclic graphs describing casual relationships among the SNPs (interventions), genes, and traits such\nas AD. The project will develop high-dimensional inferential tools based on modi\ufb01ed likelihood ratio tests and a\ndata perturbation scheme to account for the uncertainty involved in a discovery process. Moreover, it will focus\non hypothesis testing on (1) the directionality and strength of multiple (linear/nonlinear) causal relations and (2)\nthe presence of a pathway of causal relations. Computationally, the project will develop innovative methods and\nalgorithms for large-scale problems. For application, based on the reconstructed gene regulatory networks, we\nwill \ufb01rst identify causal genes for AD and AD's risk factors, such as lipids, then infer which of the risk factors are\n(putatively) causal to AD.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\nExecutive function is a multifaceted construct that includes higher-order cognitive processes such as response\ninhibition, working memory, and goal selection. Executive abilities improve throughout adolescence, and\ndeficits of executive function, or executive dysfunction, are a transdiagnostic feature of many psychiatric\ndisorders that emerge during this period of development. Understanding the underlying neurodevelopmental\nmechanisms that contribute to executive dysfunction is a critical prerequisite for targeted interventions. Iron\ndeficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency in the world and is a known source of executive dysfunction\nduring the vulnerable windows of early childhood and adolescence. However, despite its prevalence and\nimpact, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood. This proposal focuses on a\npotentially critical but under-explored mechanism linking iron deficiency to transdiagnostic executive\ndysfunction: brain iron deficiency. Aim 1 will define how brain iron deficiency during adolescence mediates the\neffect of peripheral iron deficiency on executive dysfunction. We will first investigate this relationship in a large\ncommunity-based sample (n=9,500 with peripheral iron and cognitive assessment, n=1,601 with neuroimaging)\nand then replicate and extend the model to a sample that is enriched for individuals with psychiatric disorders.\nAim 2 will use a prospectively collected sample of adolescents with and without a history of iron deficiency in\nroutine screenings at 9-18monts of age to determine how iron deficiency across childhood and adolescence\nimpacts brain iron deficiency and executive dysfunction in adolescence. Critically, this aim will inform a multi-hit\nmodel whereby iron deficiency across childhood and adolescence will be associated with greater brain iron\ndeficiency and thus more severe executive function than having iron deficiency in only one of the two time\nperiods. Finally, Aim 3 will examine how sex differences in peripheral iron deficiency impact sex differences in\nbrain iron after the onset of puberty. Together, these aims will identify both the timing of vulnerability and the\nneurobiological mechanisms underlying executive dysfunction, thus informing translational models for targeted\ntreatments and interventions. The support of this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence award will provide the\napplicant with the training necessary to achieve these aims, including training in developmental\nneuropsychiatry, cognitive assessment, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, and advanced biostatistics.\nThese training objectives will be accomplished with the support of an outstanding mentorship team, Drs.\nSatterthwaite, Gur, Witschey, Shinohara, Wehrli, and Georgieff, and the world class technical and intellectual\nresources of the University of Pennsylvania. Together, the proposed scientific aims and training objectives will\nform the foundation for an independent research program aimed at uncovering the neurodevelopmental\nmechanisms for executive dysfunction in youth with mental illness.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT\nMany neurological and psychiatric disorders are essentially connectionist disorders: certain sets of neurons\nhave abnormally increased or decreased connectivity with other sets of neurons. Deep brain stimulation\n(DBS) therapies target small, unique populations of axons and/or cell bodies in order to treat brain disorders\nand normalize connectivity. Thus, mapping the wiring diagram of the brain is an important goal. Macroscale\nconnectivity has been studied indirectly in humans using noninvasive neuroimaging. In order to develop a\nmuch higher resolution connectivity map of the brain, this project will develop depth-resolved polarized light\nimaging to visualize axons and fiber tracts. Since brain imaging and mapping at microscopic resolution is\nfeasible with intrinsic optical contrasts (e.g. polarization-based) and depth-resolved block-face imaging is\ndesired before histological processing, we have developed the serial optical coherence scanner (SOCS) for\nlarge-scale or whole brain imaging with microscopic resolution. SOCS combines a polarization-maintaining\nfiber based polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography and a tissue slicer. This project will create a\nnovel SOCS system that can image axonal tracts at the micron scale spatial resolution using unbiased optical\ncontrasts (Aim 1). The approach will be evaluated, refined, and compared in the same brain tissue to neural\ntract-tracer labeling of tracts associated with DBS targets for brain disorders, in nonhuman animal models\n(Aim 2). The approach will then be applied to DBS targets in the human brain (Aim 3). The physical scales at\nwhich this project investigates the brain microstructure are unique (1-10 \u03bcm resolution across centimeters of\ntissue). This project will pave the way for the foundation of a future human connectome at the micron scale,\nwhich is the highest resolution achievable with current optical technology for imaging an entire human brain.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nOverview: Reproduction relies on a complex series of cell fate decisions, cell cycle transitions, \nand differentiation events, which coordinate the formation and function of gametes with \nthe process of meiosis. A century of research using many experimental organisms, \nincluding the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, defined key intercellular signals regulating \ngermline development, delineated central players in meiosis, and revealed the importance of \npost-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms. Yet, important mechanistic questions remain about \nhow intercellular communication integrates the underlying molecular mechanisms into a coherent \ngermline developmental program. This research proposal addresses several central questions:\n\u2022How do soma-germline gap junctions orchestrate germline development, coordinate \ngermline developmental subroutines, and integrate nutritional signals to optimize reproduction?\n\u2022How do intercellular signals and gametic interactions regulate protein translation to enable \nfertilization and ensure the vitality of the embryo?\n\u2022Can we exploit the dynamic nature of germline development in which germ cell nuclei move within \nthe gonadal tube to provide broad insights into the cell biology of diseases affecting the nuclear \nenvelope?\nGoals: The chief goal of our work is to delineate the regulatory networks governing conserved and \nessential steps in germline development. Our focus will be on three areas: (1) The role of gap \njunctions in controlling soma-germline interactions; (2) The regulation of protein \ntranslation by intercellular signaling during oocyte meiotic maturation and the \noocyte-to-embryo transition; and (3) Studies in the C. elegans germline system that provide \ninsights into the cell biology of a class of human diseases affecting the nuclear envelope. In \npursuing these goals, we will fill three key gaps in understanding: (i) the nature of the active \nbiomolecules that transit through gap junctions to mediate their many essential reproductive \nfunctions; (ii) the function and regulation of a large translational regulatory machine that lies \nat the heart of the oocyte meiotic maturation decision and the oocyte-to-embryo transition; and \n(iii) the involvement of nuclear mechanotransduction and endogenous mechanical forces in the \norigin of diseases affecting the nuclear envelope.\nVision: Using the powerful combination of genetic and modern molecular technologies available in C. \nelegans, we will advance our understanding of germline development, germline stem cell behavior, \nand oogenesis. In the course of these investigations, we will discover new molecular principles \nvital to human health and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat disease. \nThis fundamental research in a genetic model system will generate foundational knowledge for \nunderstanding reproduction and the origin of birth defects.",

To achieve this goal, we have designed and implemented an interdisciplinary\ntraining program to transform graduate education in genetics and genomics at the University of Minnesota. Our\nSpecific Aims are: (i) to provide students with rigorous and quantitative training in the fundamentals and state-\nof-the-art advances in genetics, genomics, and computational biology; (ii) to leverage the many collaborative\nresearch and educational strengths of our institution to provide new interdisciplinary student-centered graduate\ntraining opportunities that transcend departmental and collegiate boundaries; and (iii) to generate a diverse\ncohort of well-trained scientists able to integrate their broad skillset and their hunger for lifelong learning into\ntheir work across a multitude of careers in the biomedical workforce. This program will enable trainees to\npursue many impactful career opportunities in academia, biotechnology, government, health care, or education\ncreated by recent advancements in genetics and genomics, including careers in fields that are undergoing\nrapid change, as well as careers in areas that do not presently exist or that are nascent. In recognition of the\nfact that the geneticists of tomorrow must possess quantitative acumen, we have not only developed new\ncourses emphasizing bioinformatics and computational approaches, but we have also integrated these into our\ntraining program through a major redesign of the graduate curriculum pursuant to evaluation by internal and\nexternal review panels. In a sense, genetics and genomics are foundational fields that transcend and unify\nmultiple disciplines within the biological sciences because what sets living things apart from inanimate objects\nis that all living things possess within them molecular blueprints for their construction, genomes. An impactful\naspect of this academic and research training program is that it seeks to transcend traditional departmental\nboundaries by bringing together researchers from multiple disciplines within the biomedical sciences who\nutilize genetic and genomic analyses in their research. In so doing, this training program seeks to promote\ninterdisciplinary research, foster collaborative team science, and implement individualized student-centered\neducational and career development programs. Our training program includes 50 highly productive and\ncollaborative faculty from ten departments across five colleges at the University of Minnesota. We are seeking\nsupport for six PhD trainees for two years each beginning in year two of their academic program, with funding\nfor year one provided by institutional funds. In addition to their thesis research, trainees will participate in\nprofessional development programs aimed at promoting their transition into and long-term success in\nbiomedical science-related careers.",

To address this\ndisparity in the state of Minnesota and more broadly, the University of Minnesota formulated and implemented\nthe Minnesota IRACDA Program. The Minnesota IRACDA Program is a collaboration between the University of\nMinnesota and the nearby community colleges of Normandale Community College and North Hennepin\nCommunity College, which predominantly serve students from minority and low-income urban populations. The\nMinnesota IRACDA Program provides a diverse cohort of recent PhD scholars with rigorous scientific research\ntraining, instruction, mentoring, experience in teaching, and career development guidance. The long-term goal\nof the Minnesota IRACDA Program is to develop and implement successful and creative strategies to promote\nand facilitate the transition of talented postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds into independent\nfaculty careers in biomedical research and education. The overall objectives of the Minnesota IRACDA Program\nare to: (1) Recruit postdoctoral scholars from backgrounds that have been historically excluded from STEM\nresearch and education and provide them with strong multitiered mentoring in cutting-edge biomedical research.\n(2) Provide the postdoctoral scholars with pedagogical training in modern teaching techniques that incorporate\ndiverse populations, and mentored practice in evidence-based teaching at the undergraduate level at two\nteaching-intensive institutions that predominantly serve students from minority and low-income urban\npopulations\u2014Normandale Community College and North Hennepin Community College. (3) Equip postdoctoral\nscholars with a multitude of career and professional development opportunities and programs including,\nparticipation in workshops that address scientific communication, publication, job searches, grant writing,\nprofessional advancement, and diversity, equity, and inclusion in biomedical research. (4) Provide URM\nundergraduates from the teaching-intensive partner institutions with paid authentic research opportunities at the\nUniversity of Minnesota in which they are mentored by the postdoctoral scholars. In the first funding period, the\nMinnesota IRACDA Program met or exceeded all key benchmarks: (i) Nearly 40% of the IRACDA scholars\nrecruited to the program were from URM backgrounds. (ii) IRACDA scholars were successful in career\nprogression. Of the six scholars who completed training, four moved on to tenure-track Assistant Professor or\nLecturer positions. (iii) URM undergraduate students participated in authentic research under the mentorship of\nIRACDA scholars and most successfully transferred to four-year degree programs. We are seeking funding to\nsupport six IRACDA postdoctoral scholars per year when the program is fully populated.",

Unfortunately, the broad\ntropism of AAV is detrimental when gene delivery to specific cells (e.g., cancer) is paramount and ectopic\nexpression in healthy cells or tissues poses a risk to the patient\u2019s safety.\nWe recently reported a working prototype of a novel configurable viral gene delivery technology. This technology\nconsists of a capsid that we genetically engineer to express an adapter domain to which we covalently attach\nmonoclonal antibodies to form antibody-AAV composites. AAV tropism is redirected toward the antibody\u2019s\ncognate receptor, which is expressed on a targeted cell type, but not off-target cell populations.\nHere, we will take the next critical steps to build on this prototype and broaden the impact of our technology. We\nwill improve composite-AAV formation efficiency and infectivity (Aim 1), comprehensively map additional\nengineerable capacity across AAV serotypes identify new capsid engineering strategies and enable machine-\nlearning guided AAV design (Aim 2) and, as a proof of concept, determine target specificity and spread of AAV\ncomposites in vivo (Aim 3).\nThe outcome of this work will be a validated viral vector platform technology that uses antibodies to target gene\ndelivery to rationally identified cell types. This technology will enable fundamentally new gene therapy paradigms\nand, in the longer term, lead to new therapeutic approaches for inherited disorders and cancer.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Abstract\n Opioid addiction is a public health crisis, characterized by compulsive drug seeking and a pervasive\nvulnerability to relapse, with few therapeutic options available. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a central hub\nwithin reward circuitry and plays a critical role in the motivational value of drugs and drug-associated cues. Within\nthe heterogeneous neuronal subtypes of the NAc exist the sparsely distributed fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs).\nThe NAc FSIs receive strong excitatory inputs from cortical, thalamic and limbic regions and exert powerful\ninhibition over the local projection neurons, making them a prime candidate for translational therapeutic\nstrategies to reduce the burden of the opioid abuse epidemic. The overall objectives of this application are to\nelucidate how NAc FSI circuitry responds to, and mediates, opioid self-administration.\n Under the primary mentorship of Dr. Patrick Rothwell at the University of Minnesota, Dr. Lefevre has\nutilized graduate training in molecular and behavioral pharmacology techniques, and post-doctoral training in ex-\nvivo electrophysiology to study adaptations in NAc circuitry in non-contingent opioid addiction models. This\nPathway to Independence Award will provide the opportunity to broaden the candidate\u2019s expertise to include in\nvivo fiber photometry calcium imaging, and chemogenetics, under the continued mentorship of Dr. Rothwell. To\nexpand career development in addiction research, Dr. Lefevre will receive additional support from co-mentor Dr.\nMark Thomas in the implementation of contingent opioid self-administration models in female and male mice.\n During the mentored (K99) phase of the award, fiber photometry calcium imaging will be used to monitor\nin vivo activity patterns of NAc FSIs in an Intermittent Access (IntA) fentanyl self-administration protocol to identify\nhow this neural population responds to contingent fentanyl and fentanyl-associated cues. Subsequently, a\nchemogenetic approach, which will involve targeted expression of Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by\nDesigner Drugs (DREADDs) by NAc FSIs, will be used to test the hypothesis that these neurons play a functional\nrole in addiction-related behavior. Following fentanyl self-administration, DREADDs will be used to excite or\ninhibit NAc FSIs prior to progressive ratio and cue-induced reinstatement tests. This innovative combination of\ntools will be used to test the relationship between NAc FSIs and the manifestation of fentanyl self-administration.\n The R00 phase of the award will distinguish Dr. Lefevre\u2019s independent research from her mentors and\nbroaden to identifying the role of excitatory synaptic inputs to NAc FSIs. Ex-vivo electrophysiology will be utilized\nto define input-specific excitatory synaptic plasticity adaptations in NAc FSIs induced by fentanyl self-\nadministration. Additionally, the R00 aims will incorporate electrophysiology, optogenetic and calcium imaging\nexpertise to develop stimulation protocols that restore opioid induced shifts in FSI circuitry and addiction-like\nbehavior. Overall, the aims proposed in this award will identify key FSI circuits in opioid self-administration and\nprovide the foundation for Dr. Lefevre\u2019s independent research program studying the neural circuitry of addiction.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nMetastatic relapse may occur in patients with ER+ breast cancer decades after original diagnosis. Most breast\ncancer related deaths are caused by metastasis and thus identifying at-risk patients and developing therapies to\nprevent reactivation are a crucial challenge. These efforts have been impeded by a lack of understanding of\ncancer cell dormancy in the bone marrow, believed to be the cellular source of metastatic relapse. It is not well\nunderstood how tumor cells interact with the bone marrow microenvironment and how these interactions regulate\ntumor cell dormancy and escape. My proposed research seeks to develop a mouse model of dormancy and\ninvestigate the spatial organization of the bone marrow niche in patient samples in the mentored K99 phase and\ndevelop a biomaterial model of dormancy in the independent R00 phase. I hypothesize (i) cancer stem cells are\na subset of disseminated tumor cells responsible for metastatic relapse and (ii) the bone marrow niche, including\nthe healthy stem cell niche, facilitates dormancy and reactivation of these cells. In Aim 1, I will develop a novel\nmouse model of hormone responsive breast cancer dormancy in bone marrow and evaluate the presence,\nphenotype, and microenvironmental regulation of disseminated tumor cells using optical tissue clearing/3D\nimaging of whole bone. In Aim 2, I will investigate the hypothesis that tumor cell interactions with the bone marrow\nniche control tumor cell phenotype via high dimensional spatial analysis of bone marrow biopsies from patients\nwith breast cancer including imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and spatial single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq).\nIn Aim 3, I will develop a biomaterial model of the dormant bone marrow niche via creating mechanical mimics\nof the three distinct compartments of bone marrow and evaluate the role of mechanosensing in induction and\nmaintenance of dormancy. In the K99 phase of the award, Prof Max Wicha will serve as my main mentor. Dr.\nWicha is a pioneer in the cancer stem cell field and is an expert in breast cancer biology and metastasis. I will\nwork with and consult my collaborators and mentoring team, including Prof Fei Wen (imaging mass cytometry),\nEvan Keller (single cell spatial analysis program), Dr. Dafydd Thomas (pathology core), Prof Gary Luker\n(microscopy), Prof Monika Burness (breast cancer clinical oncology) and Prof Sofia Merjaver (breast cancer\nmolecular biology). My K99 training will consist of developing a novel mouse model of bone marrow dormancy\nand learning bioinformatics approaches to analyze spatial contributions to cellular phenotype in IMC and\nscRNAseq data to propel me toward developing a synthetic dormant bone marrow niche mimic using\nbiomaterials during the independent R00 phase. In sum, the proposed research will address an urgent, unmet\nneed to identify the role of the bone marrow niche in breast cancer dormancy and reactivation, which may provide\na path forward for identifying patients at higher risk of metastasis and developing therapies against reactivation.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\n Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes localized and disseminated\ndisease, cryptococcosis, in immunocompromised individuals, such as in people living with HIV. A life-\nthreatening manifestation of cryptococcosis is cryptococcal meningitis (CM); a central nervous system infection\nwith acute inflammation of the meninges and the most common cause of meningitis in those with HIV. Sub-\nSaharan Africa carries the majority of the global CM disease burden and mortality. Because the host immune\nresponse is crucial to clearance of the infection and resolution of symptoms, a solid understanding of the host\nimmune response in the state of cryptococcal infection is essential in order to reduce morbidity and mortality.\n Natural killer (NK) cells are an innate lymphoid immune cell that has been understudied in CM. NK cells\nhave antigen independent cytotoxic ability that render them ideal for targeting both intracellular and\nextracellular pathogens. This key feature of NK cells could make them an important aspect in the immune\nresponse to C. neoformans, which is both an intracellular and extracellular pathogen. Standard antifungal\ntherapy targets the pathogen, yet mortality still occurs, including among persons with sterile CSF cultures. My\npreliminary data has shown that low CSF concentrations of NK cell cytotoxicity associated soluble molecules\nare associated with increased risk of acute 14-day mortality in persons with CM. Therefore, improving NK\ncytotoxic activity may be an innovative therapeutic pathway toward reducing cryptococcal mortality.\nAdditionally, the identification of genes and pathways implicated in impaired NK cell function that could be\nmodulated to improve cytotoxicity could be targets for future therapeutics.\n My central hypothesis is that NK cells contribute to fungal clearance of C. neoformans, but that a\ncombination of NK cell exhaustion, impaired cytokine production, increased inhibitory receptors, and\ndecreased activating receptor expression due to the underlying HIV infection disrupts their cytotoxic abilities.\nTo test the central hypothesis, I am proposing the following Aims: Aim 1 seeks to compare NK cell natural\ncytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity between HIV-infected persons with CM who die\nwithin 14-days of diagnosis and those who survive >14 day. Aim 2 seeks to determine if persons with CM who\ndie within 14-days have high levels of differentially expressed genes involved in exhaustion and inhibition of\ncytotoxicity pathways when compared to persons who survive CM. Collectively, these findings will provide the\nfirst quantification of NK cell cytotoxicity against clinical isolates of C. neoformans and the identification of\ndifferentially expressed genes associated with acute CM mortality. This information will provide us with specific\ngenes that are involved in exhaustion, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity that could be modulated in the\nfuture with host targeted immunotherapy.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nNerve damage is a common affliction that causes sensory and/or motor deficits. Recovery involves a\nregenerative process in which damaged axons within a nerve fiber must re-extend to the appropriate target\ntissues, in a process known as target-specific regeneration. This process often fails in humans, leaving patients\nwith chronic health problems. Improving clinical outcomes requires a better understanding of how target-specific\nregeneration is regulated. We know that components of the nerve support scaffold can guide axon re-extension\nalong simple paths. However, when axons reach nerve branch points, they require more specific guidance\nmechanisms to differentiate between multiple paths and select the correct one. We have little understanding of\nwhat environmental cues guide these decisions, and how they are appropriately interpreted by regrowing axons.\nThe objective of this proposal is to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate axon targeting\ndecisions to promote target-specific regeneration.\nI have established the zebrafish vagus nerve as a model to elucidate mechanisms of target-specific axon\nregeneration. Regenerating vagus axons select between five nerve branches to robustly re-innervate the correct\ntarget tissue, although how they do so is not known. I hypothesize that two non-mutually-exclusive mechanisms\nregulate target-specific regeneration: 1) chemosensation, in which a regenerating axon can interpret spatially\npatterned chemical guidance cues in the environment that direct its growth; 2) fasciculation, in which a\nregenerating axon can recognize undamaged axons that are innervating its intended target and use them as a\nsubstrate for directed growth. The three aims of this proposal will comprehensively identify how growing axons\ninteract with their environment at the cell biological and molecular levels during target-specific regeneration. In\nAim 1, I will combine a novel single-cell chimera regeneration assay with live imaging and genetic and\npharmacological manipulations to establish a conceptual understanding of how in vivo axon-environment\ninteractions guide targeting decisions. In Aim 2, I will combine a novel method to label and isolate live neurons\nbased on their innervation target with in vivo and in vitro techniques to precisely measure how axons of each of\nthe five innervation target groups interact with other axons, and with chemical signals, in the environment. In Aim\n3, I will combine innervation target-specific neuron isolation with RNAseq and mutant analysis for unbiased\nidentification of molecules that regulate target selection in each of the five innervation target groups. This study\nwill greatly enhance our fundamental understanding of how axons reinnervate their target tissues during\nregeneration, and provide an important knowledge base to develop improved treatments for nerve damage.",

The community surveillance aimed to monitor trends in hospitalized myocardial infarction (MI), fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) in four U.S. communities: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; suburbs of Minneapolis, MN; and Washington County, MD. Surveillance for hospitalized heart failure (HF) events was added in 2005. The communities were selected to provide data across four (4) geographic locations with a range of mortality rates, in urban, suburban, and rural settings. The cohort study aimed to investigate the risk factors for and natural history of atherosclerosis and development of clinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged white or African American adults from the same communities. The study recruited in 15,792 white or African American participants initially aged 45-64 years and selected participants received triennial clinical exams over the first ten years of the study (1987-1989, 1990-1992, 1993-1995, and 1996-1998). The clinical exam in 2011-13 was conducted on over 6,500 participants 69-89 years with a focus on characterizing heart failure stages in community-dwelling participants and enabling identification of genetic and environmental factors leading to ventricular dysfunction and vascular stiffness. These data provided the basis for several ancillary studies covering a breadth of topics. The clinical exam in 2018-19 on almost 3,600 participants 75 years and older supported exam components from 12 NIH grant-funded ancillary studies on topics including progression of Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF), coronary artery calcification, atrial fibrillation burden detected by novel continuous ECG monitoring technology, diabetes, dementia, brain amyloid deposition, and changes in arterial stiffness and cognition. Participation of the surviving cohort was 91, 82, 74, 65, and 50% at each of the respective follow-up examinations. Blood samples have been assayed for putative biochemical risk factors and stored for case-control studies. DNA has been extracted and lymphocytes cryopreserved (for possible immortalization) for study of candidate genes, genome-wide scanning, expression, and other \u2013omics investigations. Since baseline, cohort members have also been contacted every 12 months (and every 6 months since 2012) to obtain information on vital status, current residence, major illness or injury, and hospitalizations occurring between contacts to identify clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Cohort contact was 78% at the last completed follow-up period. Findings have been presented in over 2,600 publications as of 2021.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\n Cryptococcal meningitis (CM), caused by the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans\n(Cn), is a leading cause of HIV-related mortality worldwide. In healthy individuals, exposure to Cn in early\nchildhood results in a pulmonary latent infection that is asymptomatic, but leads to the formation of lung\ngranulomas. Following HIV-associated compromise of the immune system, control of latent Cn infection within\npulmonary granulomas is lost and the fungal pathogen disseminates to cause meningitis. The host immune\ncells and effector functions critical for establishing and maintaining control of latent Cn infections have not been\nidentified. Clearance of latent infections is warranted in the context of advanced HIV care. Understanding how\nthe healthy immune response controls latent Cn infection is needed to: 1) define critical immune functions that\nprevent disease, 2) determine why a healthy immune system is unable to eradicate latent infections, and 3)\ndevelop targeted therapies that mitigate disease progression in HIV patients with CM. Using a novel mouse\ninhalation model of latent cryptococcosis developed in our lab, I will test my central hypothesis that a Th1\nCD4 T-cell response is necessary and sufficient to control the latent pulmonary Cn infection, but is unable to\nclear the infection due to intrinsic deficiencies in interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) signaling caused by persistent Cn survival\nwithin granulomas. In Aim 1, I will combine laser capture microdissection with RNA sequencing to determine\nthe cellular and effector functions responsible for containing Cn within granulomas. In Aim 2, I will use a\nmouse model that mimics HIV-induced CD4 depletion and post-mortem granulomatous lung tissue biopsies\nfrom HIV patients with CM to investigate how HIV-induced loss of CD4 T-cells disrupts control of latent Cn\ninfection within granulomas. In Aim 3, I will use adoptive T-cell transfers and exogenous IFN\u03b3 supplementation\nto elucidate the CD4 T-cell subset and effector functions responsible for controlling latent Cn infection. The\nlong-term goal of these studies is the development of immune-regulated therapeutic strategies for HIV-\nassociated CM. These strategies include clearing latent Cn infection prior to HIV-immunosuppression in at-risk\nindividuals and mitigating disease progression in HIV/AIDS patients by replacing the essential Cn-specific CD4\nT-cell subset required for control of Cn infections. This proposal will lay the necessary groundwork for\ndeveloping therapies that specifically target Cn infection, but avoids eliciting immune reconstitution\ninflammatory syndrome in HIV/AIDS patients with CM.\n The proposed research and training plans provide a rigorous program for successful completion of MD-\nPhD degrees, and will further my development into a successful academic infectious disease physician\nscientist who drives cutting-edge translational research in HIV/AIDS and HIV-associated opportunistic\npathogens.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCurrent treatments for addiction remain limited by a gap in the fundamental knowledge of how different regions\nof prefrontal cortex interact in decision-making. Here, we examine the direct neural correlates in prefrontal\ncortex of the control and costs of effortful decision making in humans at high spatiotemporal resolution, laying\nthe groundwork for the development of new treatments to improve decision making in addiction.\nThis K23 Career Development Award aims to provide me with the necessary training to become an\nindependent investigator translating intracranial studies of decision making into non-invasive biomarkers and\ntargets for neuromodulation in addiction. Toward this end, I propose the following training objectives: (1)\nDevelop advanced skills in neural decoding from intracranial electrophysiology data; (2) gain expertise in\ndesigning neuroeconomic and computational psychiatry experiments; and (3) gain expertise in utilizing brain\nstimulation in human behavioral experiments. The overall research objective of the proposed project is to\nresolve the roles played by prefrontal regions during effortful decision making by combining a neural decoding\nwith functional connectivity analysis and with cortical stimulation to perturb network function.\nThe central hypothesis is that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) allocates cognitive resources for control, based\non the cost of control assessed in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), in turn determined by the efficiency evidence\naccumulation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The specific aims of this research are to (1)\nDissociate the roles of three prefrontal regions in the regulation of cognitive control. (2) Map the\nprefrontal network allocating cognitive effort, and (3) Causally dissect the cognitive effort network.\nInnovation: (1) Method: Use of neural decoding, information theory with intracranial electrophysiology and\nstimulation to characterize prefrontal networks in humans; (2) Design: Integration of experimental paradigms\nfrom neuroeconomics with computational models of neural processing and neurophysiology; (3) Concept:\nMeasuring and modulating cognitive effort through simultaneous recording and stimulation of prefrontal regions\nduring effortful decision-making. The proposed research is significant because it resolves a controversy over\nthe functional roles of key regions of prefrontal cortex in effortful decision making that are putative targets for\nneuromodulation in addiction. The new fundamental knowledge generated by this proposal will lay the\nfoundation for the development of novel biomarkers and targets for improving cognitive control and decision\nmaking in addiction with mechanism-based computationally guided neuromodulation.",

In the next cycle, we will implement our theoretically and community framed program, including a high school engagement year (HS Scholars), a high school summer internship and service-learning component (HS Interns), an undergraduate summer internship (Undergrad Interns), and teacher professional development. In our inaugural cycle, we successfully met our recruitment goals to train and mentor 300 high school and undergraduate students, and 20 high school science teachers. We engaged in continuous quality improvement resulting in high program satisfaction, and evidence of impact on targeted student outcomes (science self-efficacy, identity, and intrinsic utility) and on student persistence in sciences. Notable areas of innovation moving forward include: for HS Interns, a scaffolded research lab experience and service-learning with community mentors to maximize outreach opportunities and support science identity development; for Undergrad Interns, a longitudinal community based participatory research experience that complements their mentored lab training, and for teachers an intensive lab experience aligned to their priorities for building science curricula. We will integrate these innovations to support the academic persistence of 250 high school students attending ten high schools, 50 undergraduate students from across Minnesota, and the professional development of 20 teachers through a multicomponent program combining research mentorship, academic and professional development, and support for science-oriented identity development. Five cohorts of 50 high school students will be recruited to the HS Scholars program comprised of exciting hands-on experiences in Science Saturdays, virtual near-peer mentorship activities and parent programs. Ten students per cohort will be selected to continue to an intensive eight-week summer HS Internship including a mentored research component scaffolded for high school students, and a service learning experience. Ten undergraduate students per year will participate in a nine-week summer internship combining academic and professional development and hands on individual research mentorships. Finally, we will deepen the science-focused skills of 4 high school science teachers per year from collaborating schools through a hands-on research lab experience paired with support to develop curricula responsive to the needs of all learners.

Disparities in cancer incidence, prevalence, screening, treatment\nand survivorship are persistent, with persons from socioeconomically under-resourced and disadvantaged\npopulations and racial/ethnic minorities disproportionately burdened. This program meets the essential need to\ntrain a diverse cadre of investigators to address cancer health disparities through innovative, multi-level and\nmulti-domain interventions and community-engaged research. The primary goal of our T32 Program is to\nprepare predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees with the knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary to\nconduct cancer related intervention research with populations experiencing health disparities. Our 3 Training\nAims are to: 1) to increase the number of predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees committed to intervention and\ntranslational research addressing cancer disparities by leveraging the strengths of the current training program,\nincluding curricular, mentored research, and career development components; 2) each year, prepare three\npredoctoral and three postdoctoral trainees to reduce cancer related health disparities; and 3) enhance the\ndiversity of the research workforce in cancer related health disparities by committing to recruiting at least 50%\nof trainees from backgrounds underrepresented in research. We seek to educate researchers who are well\nprepared to design, implement, and disseminate innovative community-engaged interventions to reduce\ncancer related disparities. With this renewal, we also will pursue three initiatives that are responsive to trainee\nfeedback and innovations in health equity research. First, our leadership, mentorship, and curriculum have\nbeen aligned with scientific approaches to health disparities research focused on multiple levels and domains\nof influence along the cancer continuum. Second, the role of our Community Mentors has been transformed to\nfacilitate increased opportunities for trainees to acquire skills and experiences in community-engaged\nresearch. Finally, we will expand the focus on intervention development to address trainee recommendations\nfor education in intervention implementation. Our training program is designed to prepare investigators skilled\nin intervention and translational research to reduce cancer health disparities with a focus on community\nengaged research. We will achieve our goals through an enriching mentored experience, didactic training, and\ncollaborative research training and projects. Overall, our proposal is highly aligned with the NCI priorities for\nAdvancing Public Health in Cancer.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT \u2013 Community Engagement Core\nCommunity engagement is essential for developing, conducting and disseminating research on the prevention,\ntreatment and management of chronic condition disparities in BIPOC communities. Despite the 130 billion\ndollars invested annually in health research in the U.S., health disparities for racial/ethnic minorities are real,\npersistent, and significant in Minnesota and nationally. A portion of this discrepancy may be because of limited\ncommunity engagement in designing and conducting research, and limited dissemination of research results to\ncommunity, practice, and policy settings. The Center for Chronic Disease Reduction and Equity Promotion\nAcross Minnesota (C2DREAM) seeks to reduce disparities in cardiovascular disease and the related chronic\nconditions of hypertension and obesity experienced by Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC)\ncommunities in Minnesota. C2DREAM will focus on the pressing need to identify ways that racism and\ndiscrimination at interpersonal, structural, and intervention implementation levels function as a driver of\ndisparities in chronic disease risk and outcomes across BIPOC communities in Minnesota. To support the\nsuccess of the goals of C2DREAM a proactive community-engagement infrastructure is needed, co-led by a\ncoalition of expert regional stakeholders, to develop critical and anti-racist community engagement processes\nand disseminate relevant and actionable information and findings to stakeholders across the region.\n The Community Engagement (CE) Core\u2019s overarching goal is to support the activities of C2DREAM by\nbuilding the strong foundation of critical and anti-racist community engagement practices needed to\nmeaningfully address the drivers of disparities in chronic disease risk and outcomes across BIPOC\ncommunities in Minnesota. The CE Core will support the activities of C2DREAM by building a regional\ncommunity and academic Coalition to offer guidance and input on engagement and dissemination (Aim 1). We\nwill then build a strong foundation of critical and anti-racist community engagement practices academic and\ncommunity stakeholders (Aim 2). We will guide community engaged informed dissemination throughout\nC2DREAM (Aim 3) and finally, using RE-AIM we will evaluate CE Core activities. (Aim 4). Our engagement\nand dissemination processes are based on evidence of best practices in knowledge transfer and\ncommunication: that evidence is most likely to be used by the end-users when they are engaged early in the\nprocess, when the evidence is communicated by a credible messenger, and when the evidence is presented in\nformats that enhance the likelihood of impact. The CE Core will generate sustained impact by creating an\ninnovative infrastructure for community engagement and dissemination on research on the prevention,\ntreatment and management of cardiovascular disease and the related chronic conditions of hypertension and\nobesity, particularly in relation to health disparities impacting BIPOC communities.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Project 1\nAcross many measures, immigrant populations arrive to the US healthier than the general population, but the\nlonger they reside in the US, the more their cardiovascular risk rises, mediated in part by systemic factors that\npromote the adoption of unhealthy behaviors. Given the complex sociocultural forces that influence these\nbehaviors, a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach is needed to address them. Rochester\nHealthy Community Partnership (RHCP) is a CBPR partnership experienced at collectively deploying\ninterventions with immigrant groups. RHCP tested an intervention of 12 face-to-face modules to promote healthy\nbehaviors within immigrant populations. At 12 months, there were significant improvements in the primary\noutcome of dietary quality compared with controls, suggesting this program could meet the unique needs of\nimmigrant communities. However, the intervention intensity limits its dissemination potential, and the intervention\ndid not explicitly address healthful weight loss, nor target overweight or obese participants. Subsequently, a\nsocial network (SN) analysis of 1,301 Hispanic and Somali adults found that obesity and behaviors clustered by\nascertainable SNs. RHCP partners then re-designed existing intervention materials for overweight and obese\nadults from immigrant communities to be delivered by peer interventionists within their social networks. The\nresultant social network intervention was pilot tested with 4 groups (2 Somali, 2 Hispanic; total N=39); participants\ndemonstrated significant reduction in weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol as well as improvements in their\ndietary quality and physical activity at 3 months (100% retention rate). Building on this, our overall objective is to\nfoster sustainable health promotion for Southeast Minnesota immigrant communities. The aims of this program\nare to 1) assess the efficacy of a social network-informed CBPR-derived health promotion intervention on obesity\nand other measures of cardiovascular risk in two immigrant communities; and, 2) assess the impact on\nsustainability and uptake outcomes of embedding the intervention within a regional health promotion resource\nhub. Using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design, 46 social network sub-groups of adults (23 Hispanic, 23\nSomali) with approximately 322 participants (7 per group) will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention\neither immediately or after a delay of one year. The intervention will consist of 12 community-based mentoring\nand education sessions, followed by 12 maintenance sessions delivered by trained Somali and Hispanic\ninterventionists to members of their groups in a face-to-face or virtual format. Outcomes measured through 24\nmonths, will be derived from the American Heart Association\u2019s \u201cLife\u2019s Simple 7\u201d: BMI and waist circumference,\nblood pressure, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, physical activity level, and dietary quality. This program\nwill mobilize the power of SNs for scalable and sustainable solutions to obesity-related behaviors among difficult\nto reach populations. CBPR enhances the relevance of this program by targeting sociocultural determinants of\nthese behaviors.",

This\nstudy implements two multi-level evidence-based interventions (EBIs) Minnesota NET-Works and Stanford\nGOALS in partnership with six American Indian after school programs and community-serving organizations in\nthe Minneapolis, St Paul and Duluth Minnesota. Adoption and maintenance of these programs can be\nenhanced and effectiveness strengthened through a structured, evidence-based participatory approach that\ntailors the interventions to meet the cultural, organizational contextual, and broader socioeconomic context and\nincorporates local innovations. This proposal is poised to achieve these goals through a community-based\nparticipatory research (CBPR).Coalition including the healthcare provider Minneapolis Native American\nCommunity Clinic (NACC, primary care system), Minneapolis and St Paul and Duluth Minnesota School\nDistricts' Indian Education after school programs (school system), the social service provider Division of Indian\nWork's Family Spirit Home Visitation program (social service provider system), departments of public health\nand University of Minnesota researchers. The Coalition will use the evidence-based 10-step Getting to\nOutcomes (GTO) tailoring and implementation approach to enhance implementation fidelity, reach and\nacceptance, and sustainability among the after school programs and community-serving organizations. Native\nAmerican organization leadership and program delivery staff will receive mentoring and training in the tailored\nEBI curricula and in effective implementation strategies. Implementation strategy effectiveness will be\nassessed using a stepped wedge study design. The study uses the Social Ecological Model as its multilevel\nintervention framework, and RE-AIM as its implementation process evaluation measurement framework.\nImplementation outcomes include organizational leadership support, staff implementation capacity, and\nintervention fidelity (program reach, intervention content, delivery, receipt and dose). An important innovative\naspect of the proposed research is its use of evidence-based implementation strategies to strengthen the\ncapacity of the programs and staff to implement the interventions with broad reach, high participation, and\nstrong fidelity by aligning with local culture and context. The proposed project will use proven effective\nimplementation strategies to build program organizational leadership and program delivery staff\nimplementation capacity to successfully engage urban Native American families in strengths-based, culturally-\ngrounded programs to promote youth physical activity and healthy eating. Sustained program engagement\namong urban Native American families will promote healthy eating and physical activity behaviors that will\nreduce future cardiovascular disease risk in this highly burdened community.",

    "abstract_text": "Neighborhood parks hold great potential as attractive and accessible settings to promote and enhance physical\nactivity (PA) among racially/ethnically diverse low-income youth. However, little park-based intervention\nresearch has been conducted to explore how this potential might be realized. No previous park-level\nintervention has experimentally evaluated youth sports program fee waivers or intensive park outreach\nstrategies to increase child enrollment and participation in park-based youth sports programs. The proposed\nresearch combines these promising intervention strategies into a single intervention and uses a gold-standard\nrandomized controlled study design, and focuses on a low-income, racially/ethnically diverse sample at highest\nrisk for developmental declines in physical activity. The proposed study evaluates the effects of a park-level\nintervention to increase moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and decrease sedentary time among low-\nincome racially/ethnically diverse children ages 6-12 yrs. Neighborhood parks (n=24) will be randomized for a\n2-year period to one of two experimental conditions: 1) Intensive Outreach and Youth Sports Program Fee\nWaiver; or 2) Comparison Condition: Current Outreach and Youth Sports Program Fee Structure. The\nintervention outreach and fee waiver components are expected to support parents to enroll their child in park-\nbased youth sports programs by decreasing social/cultural and economic barriers to child enrollment and\nparticipation. The evaluation cohort will consist of 432 children ages 6-12 yrs who reside in one of the 24 park\nneighborhoods randomized to the experimental conditions. Measurements from individual children will be\ncollected at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months. Specific Aims of this research are: Specific Aim 1: To evaluate\nthe effects of a park-level intervention on changes in child MVPA over 6, 12 and 24 months; Specific Aim 2:\nTo evaluate the effects of a park-level interventions on changes in child sedentary behavior over 6, 12 and 24\nmonths; Exploratory Aim 3: To evaluate the effects of a park-level interventions on changes in parent light\nactivity and sedentary behavior over 6, 12 and 24 months. Hypothesis 1: Children who live in a neighborhood\nwhere the park is randomized to intensive park outreach and fee waiver will have larger increases in MVPA\nand decreases in sedentary behavior at 6, 12 and 24 months relative to children who live in a comparison\nneighborhood. Hypothesis 2: Parents of children who live in a neighborhood where the park is randomized to\nintensive park outreach and fee waiver will have larger increases in light PA and decreases in sedentary\nbehavior at 6, 12 and 24 months relative to parents of children who live in a comparison neighborhood.\nIMPACT: The proposed research will provide evidence about the effectiveness of a park-based intervention\nthat includes intensive park outreach and youth sports program fee waivers on changes in child physical\nactivity in low-income, diverse urban communities. It will provide critical information needed to support policies\nand programs that reduce disparities in physical activity among high risk youth.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT \u2013 Project 2\nTobacco use is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and related chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension;\nCVD & RCC). According to the 2014 Surgeon General\u2019s Report on smoking and health, cigarette smoking\ncauses about 1 in 4 deaths from CVD. BIPOC communities experience higher prevalence of CVD & RCC\ncompared to White communities due, in part, to disparities in tobacco exposure. Smoking can be effectively\ntreated with guideline-recommended cessation counseling and medication, but such treatments are rarely used\nand are particularly unlikely to be offered to or used by BIPOC patients. Project 2 of C2DREAM tests the effect\nof adding an intervention to promote health equity among BIPOC patients: Longitudinal Proactive Outreach\n(LPO; 4 culturally tailored outreach call cycles over one year by a counselor trained in motivational interviewing\nto help connect patients to cessation counseling and medication) to the current standard of care, Ask-Advise-\nConnect (AAC; primary care providers asking all patients if they smoke, advising smokers to quit, and\nconnecting smokers to the state quit line through an electronic referral). The proposed Project has 3 aims: A1:\nConduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the direct effect of AAC+LPO (a multilevel health system\nintervention) vs. AAC on population-level smoking abstinence at 18 months and treatment utilization among\n2000 BIPOC adults. A2: Examine the moderating effects of structural racism and daily interpersonal\ndiscrimination on intervention effectiveness. A3: Use a mixed methods approach to evaluate implementation\noutcomes of appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of AAC and LPO for BIPOC patients. To test these\naims, we will conduct a hybrid type 1 implementation-effectiveness trial where 2000 BIPOC patients who\nsmoke across two urban and rural healthcare systems in Minnesota will be randomly assigned to BIPOC\ntailored LPO + AAC or AAC alone. Participants will be surveyed at 6, 12, and 18 months post-enrollment to\nassess outcomes. The primary outcome is biochemically confirmed tobacco abstinence at 18 months.\nPotential treatment mechanisms include increased treatment utilization, perceived behavioral control and\nintention to quit. Potential moderators include structural racism in communities and personal experiences of\nracism. LPO promotes health equity by addressing barriers caused by structural racism, including access to\ncare, care fragmentation, and provider racism, by systematically reaching out to all BIPOC patients who\nsmoke. LPO improves health equity by ensuring that those most at risk for CVD & RCC are offered preventive\ncare. LPO integrates individual-level treatment with public health approaches to increase treatment\nengagement. Further, LPO will be culturally tailored in collaboration with BIPOC communities in Minnesota to\neffectively reach and engage the target population.",

    "abstract_text": "Despite the prevalence of prostate cancer, the current tools available to manage the disease continues to\nleave physicians and their patients in a position to overdiagnose and overtreat. The confidence to pursue more\nconservative approaches like active surveillance are limited, as biopsy is known to underestimate the grade\nand extent of disease, both of which are important for risk stratification. Targeted biopsies, by means of MRI-\nguidance, are becoming the preferred way to ensure the most aggressive appearing lesions are sampled in the\nhopes of avoiding some of the issues with standard biopsy approaches. These targeted biopsies make use of\nmulti-parametric MRI (mpMRI) which includes both anatomical and functional information that are\ncomplimentary and together increase the sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection. However, the ability to\neffectively use mpMRI requires specialized training while the standards for properly using the multiple MRI\ndatasets are still being developed. To address this issue, we have developed an alternative method that would\nprovide a quantitative, user-independent, summary of the mpMRI data (qMRI) to visually \u201cmap\u201d disease and\nassess its aggressiveness. Using quantitative MRI, a Composite Biomarker Score (CBS) map is generated,\nwith a demonstrated increase in sensitivity and specificity for tumor detection compared to any single qMRI\nparameter. Our primary goal is to integrate this predictive qMRI model into a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD)\nsystem (referred to as CBS-CAD) to improve the use of mpMRI in PCa management. Employing quantitative\nMRI (qMRI) can address the issues of a qualitative image analysis if the major roadblocks to its adoption can\nbe overcome. To address the roadblocks and implement the CBS-CAD system we will pursue the following\nspecific aims: 1) develop an analysis pipeline to evaluate qMRI performance and translate CBS-CAD methods,\n2) perform a multi-vendor, multi-site quantitative imaging technical performance evaluation and 3) perform a\nmulti-center clinical validation study assessing CBS-CAD performance. Our expected outcome of this\nacademic-industry partnership will be the integration of several novel technologies into a comprehensive CAD\nsystem consisting of a phantom and automated software for 1) qMRI system validation and 2) clinical\ntranslation of novel models for detecting cancer and assessing aggressiveness.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT \u2013 TRD2\nMagnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy are valuable modalities providing unique information for the\nmolecular and physiological characterization of tissue. The breadth of both endogenous and exogenous\nmolecular imaging contrasts in combination with high resolution functional and anatomic imaging motivate the\ncontinued development of the methods, their biomedical applications and clinical translation. The potential to\nimprove MRI sensitivity to markers of molecular dynamics, metabolism, energetics, and critical processes\ncontinue to drive the development of MRI methods to higher and higher magnetic fields. The 10.5T whole-body\nMRI systems in our lab offers a comprehensive imaging platform to provide unprecedented access to molecular\nand functional information non-invasively. It has been shown that sensitivity, as measured by the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), scales supralinearly with the static field strength which can be leveraged to increase spatial and/or\ntemporal resolution. To realize these potential gains the need remains for continued innovation with respect to\nacquisition methods, MRI contrasts, RF management strategies, novel RF hardware, and state of the art\nreconstruction and quantification approaches. To address this need, the overall goal of this project is to develop\nnovel technologies for ultra-high field applications, with a specific focus on selected methods that will have the\ngreatest impact on the field and advance developments made in the first phase of this NCBIB. To accomplish\nthis goal, we will focus on four areas. First, we will integrate dual-tuned RF coils in a parallel transmit (pTx)\nenabled multinuclear platform and exploit its functionality through introducing novel RF optimization and\nacquisition strategies. Second, we will introduce novel rotating frame relaxation (RFR) relaxation metrics and the\nstrategies that allow us to conduct these experiments at UHF. Third, we will develop strategies for obtaining high\nresolution arterial spin labeling as a biomarker of angiogenesis and an important parameter towards deciphering\nthe neurovascular coupling occurring during brain activation. Fourth, we will explore new post processing\nmethods that work synergistically with UHF to provide minimally biased estimates of quantitative parameters for\ndomain specific applications in the presence of increasing amounts of noise as we push temporal and spatial\nresolutions. Achieving these aims will advance access to molecular and physiological parameters to characterize\ntissue, support biomedical research and impact our understanding of the living system in health and disease.\nThe challenges addressed in this project are relevant for all UHF systems including 7T which recently received\nclinical approval. As such, the impact of the proposed technologies extends well beyond 10.5T.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT (OVERALL)\nThe long-term goal of this NCBIB is to establish a national resource for enabling UHF (7T and above) magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) technologies to advance biomedical research and discovery. We propose to build on\nour successes in this renewal with four new closely linked technical research and development (TRD) projects.\nThese projects will work synergistically to realize the potential of our unique imaging resources which include\nour 10.5 Tesla (currently the highest magnetic field available for human and large non-human primate (NHP)\nimagining above 10T), and 16.4 Tesla for small to medium size animal models (one of two such high fields\nsystems in the world). TRD1 will undertake the development of a multimodal imaging with simultaneous MR and\nnovel electrodes and augment its current effort on large NHPs with a small NHP model, namely the marmosets,\nfor use in 16.4T MR and multiphoton optical imaging studies. The combination of non-invasive MR and an\ninvasive technology will provide access to neuronal activity from single neuron and synapse level over the entire\nbrain but at a coarser spatiotemporal resolution. This platform will provide opportunities for detailed studies of\nbrain function in NHP models and inform future human studies using MRI alone. TRD2 will develop new MR\ncontrasts and novel technologies for ultrahigh field applications, with a specific focus on selected technologies\nthat will have the greatest impact on associated collaborative and service projects. The effort will provide\nunparalleled sensitivity to probe molecular and physiological parameters to characterize tissue, support\nbiomedical research and impact our understanding of the living system in health and disease. TRD3 has been\nat the forefront of image reconstruction technologies, introducing multiple new methods for improved Deep\nLearning (DL) reconstruction and training, interpretable image denoising, and fast iterative algorithms. TRD3 will\ncontinue to tackle inverse problems through the lens of intelligent physics-driven technologies that synergistically\nutilize imaging physics and advances in DL methods targeting target higher resolutions and acceleration rates\nat lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), as well as to combine information across multiple nuclei or even modalities.\nTRD4 provides critical engineering solutions addressing both radiofrequency (RF) coil (i.e. antennae) designs\nand safety, towards capturing the significantly higher ultimate intrinsic SNR (uiSNR) provided by UHF. The effort\nwill employ novel RF electronics concepts including miniaturized integrated circuit low noise amplifiers and coil\nclusters and explore new receiver concepts both for multinuclear and 1H imaging and spectroscopy studies at\nthe high magnetic fields of 10.5T, 7T and 16.4T. While the focus is on uniquely high magnetic fields, the impact\nof this Center on biomedical research will extend to lower magnetic fields, as it has done so already, as well as\nto fields beyond MRI (cognitive science, neuroscience, senescence, musculoskeletal disorders, neurological\ndisorder, cancer among others).",

The optimal use of these techniques, however,\nrequires access to new methods that enable new measurement capabilities (such as new MR pulse sequences)\nand require extensive training. The general aim of this Training and Dissemination component of this P41\nNational Center for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NCBIB) is to educate scientists in the technologies\nwe develop in the NCBIB and disseminate the many products and information that will result from the activities\nof the Technology Research and Development projects. The training activities will focus on continuing education\nand advanced training in high and ultrahigh field MR imaging and spectroscopy methods, UHF instrumentation,\nand multimodal imaging for biomedical research and clinical use. The goal is to catalyze broad application of\nNCBIB tools and skill sets by a national community of basic, translational, and clinical investigators thereby\nincreasing the Center\u2019s impact. This goal will be accomplished through workshops, hands-on training courses,\npublications and conference presentations, and a comprehensive web site providing information and access.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nChemical toxicants and carcinogens present in the polluted air are the likely causative agents in the associated\ncancers of aerodigestive tract in exposed individuals. Understanding the relationship between the level of\nexposure to these pollutants and the risk of cancer is key to identifying individuals or populations at risk and\ninforming the development of preventive measures. The overarching goal of this study is to advance such\nunderstanding through a collaborative research between the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota\nand Centre for Cancer Epidemiology (CCE) in Mumbai, India. We will employ a panel of established and novel\nair pollution-related biomarkers to test our overall hypothesis that the uptake of air pollution-related chemical\ncarcinogens is associated with the risk for LC and HNC in Indian nonsmokers. In Aims 1 and 2, we will conduct\ncase-control studies to assess the association of air pollution-related biomarkers in plasma with LC and HNC,\nrespectively, in Indian nonsmokers. To achieve the goals of these Aims, we will use available biological\nsamples and questionnaire data from the corresponding epidemiological cohorts conducted by the CCE. We\nwill develop capacity for biomarker measurements at CCE by transferring the U.S. team's expertise in this\narea. In Aim 3, we will recruit healthy nonsmokers with various levels of usual exposures to air pollution, based\non their occupation or lifestyle. We will compare a panel of biomarkers of exposure and effect across the\ngroups and correlate to pollutant levels collected through personal air sampling devices worn by a subset of\nparticipants. We will use specially designed air samplers to characterize the chemical profile of various air\npollution scenarios. This aim will aid in the interpretation of biomarker data generated in Aims 1 and 2, and will\ninform future biomarker-based studies of air pollution in India. An important outcome of this study is the\ndevelopment of capacity for future biomarker research of cancer risk in India using CCE cohorts. Such\nresearch can be further expanded to other population subgroups (e.g., smokers or occupationally exposed\nindividuals) and additional environmental and dietary exposures in India.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nMany diseases are complex, heterogeneous, conditions that affect multiple organs in the body and depend on the\ninterplay between several factors that include genetic, cellular, molecular, and environmental factors. It is therefore\nnot surprising that the pathogenesis of many complex diseases remain elusive, and therapeutic targets are lacking.\nThe traditional approach that focus on a small number of molecules (e.g., genes or metabolites) or a single type of\ndata (e.g., clinical or genetic) cannot address this complexity and heterogeneity. Integrative or systems biology\napproaches and network analysis can be used to leverage the strengths of data from multiple sources (e.g.,\ngenomics, metabolomics, epidemiology, clinical data) to achieve new insights into the pathobiology of complex\ndiseases. Recent technological advances have enabled the production of vast amounts of diverse but related data\nwith rich information that offer remarkable opportunities to understand biological processes involved in complex\ndiseases and to transform medicine, yet at the same time present signi\ufb01cant analytical challenges including how\nto effectively synthesize information from the tens of thousands of data points to identify important biomarkers\nwith potential to serve as therapeutic targets. To alleviate this, we will develop and apply a suite of novel, robust,\nand powerful statistical and machine learning methods for the integration and interpretation of cross-sectional and\nlongitudinal data from multiple sources. These models will also be used to de\ufb01ne subpopulations of patients who\nhave different prognoses or require different therapeutic approaches based on data from different sources. Further,\nwe will make use of recent advances in network theory to model the complex multilateral relationships in molecular\ndata from multiple sources. The proposed methods will be applied to several publicly available datasets and cohorts\nto ensure that we can generalize our work to other datasets and cohorts and thus increase the long-term impact\nof our research. The proposed research will also contribute valuable statistical and machine learning algorithms\nthat will be broadly applicable to data from multiple sources and multiple cohorts and will be made available to the\npublic free of charge.",

IPUMS CPS streamlines access and\nreduces technical barriers to analyzing data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), the nation's most\ncomprehensive source of data on the economic and social well-being of U.S. individuals and families, including\nwomen of reproductive age and children. IPUMS CPS enables rigorous and reproducible research on population\ndynamics and the social and economic contexts in which health inequities are created and reinforced, enabling\npublic policy based on sound scientific evidence.\nBuilding on an impressive record of accomplishments since 2016, the project will undertake new initiatives to\nensure broad access, timely delivery, and innovative use of CPS data for population dynamics and population\nhealth research. The project has five specific aims: (1) Database expansion to add more than eight million person\nrecords by incorporating 65 new files that will be released between 2021 and 2026, including all CPS monthly\nand supplement data; (2) Data and metadata improvement to enhance research opportunities, reproducibility,\nand rigor; (3) Data access improvements to allow users to specify the combinations of CPS data they want\nlinked and the formats in which they will receive the data; (4) Data processing tool enhancement to reduce the\ntime to deliver new data to the research community and reduce the costs of maintaining the infrastructure over\nthe long run; (5) Expand and support the research community through targeted, thoughtful outreach, and active\nuser support and training.\nCPS data are indispensable for analyzing demographic topics identified in the core mission of the NICHD\nPopulation Dynamics Branch, including fertility, migration, population distribution, nuptiality, family demography,\npopulation growth and decline, and the causes and consequences of demographic change. They also contain\nrich measures of the most important non-clinical determinants of health and health inequities. The CPS is vital\nfor evaluating the consequences of social safety net policies for children, individuals, and families; the impact of\nlabor market disruption on marital transitions; and the implications of marital dissolution for economic well-being.\nWith data on entire households, analyses of individual-, couple-, family-, and household-level dynamics are\npossible.

LCC research addresses four research themes. (1) Later life population trends in context: the impact of both persistent and shifting macrosocial contexts for explaining changes across historical time and place in aging processes and outcomes, including physical and cognitive functioning, disability, morbidity, mortality, general health, and well-being. (2) Life course dynamics as disparity mechanisms: the processes by which social change and contexts\u2014especially the impacts of early and cumulative life experiences\u2014play out in the lives of population groups to reduce or exacerbate disparities in health outcomes. (3) Interrelationships among work, family, community participation, and health: the consequences of changing economic, familial, social, and institutional environments on life course engagement in paid work, family responsibilities (e.g., caregiving, living arrangements, engagement), and volunteering, as well as the implications for life chances, health, and life quality in the mid- and later-life course. (4) Health care services and supports for an aging population: the health and financial implications of the care infrastructure for older adults, which includes healthcare organizations, the healthcare workforce, payment models for care, and other policies for the care and support of aging populations. LCC research addressing these research themes focuses on four health disparity priority populations: (1) socioeconomically disadvantaged populations; (2) racial minority populations; (3) rural populations; and (4) sexual minority populations. The central goal of LCC is to provide an unparalleled environment for researchers to conduct impactful research to improve the health and well-being of older adults. This will be accomplished through four infrastructure Cores. Core A: Administrative and Research Support Core. This Core will provide leadership and vision, as well as logistical support and oversight for the activities of the other three Cores. This Core will also be responsible for meeting all reporting requirements to the Coordinating Center. Core B: Program Development (Pilot) Core.

This Core seeds new and innovative lines of interdisciplinary research on aging and health by providing pilot funds and unparalleled research support. Research funded by the Pilot Core addresses the Center\u2019s four research themes and health disparity priority populations and aligns with NIA priorities. This Core funds research via two new pilot grant programs: an Emerging Scholars Program (ESP) and a Highly Innovative Time-Sensitive (HITS) Pilot Program. The ESP is a two-year program with two phases: a pilot grant phase and a mentored proposal writing phase. This program is geared towards early-career scholars who are launching independent grant-funded research careers and who enhance the population aging and health research workforce. The ESP supports investigators from population-based social science disciplines at the University of Minnesota and from institutions across the nation who are members of LCC\u2019s External Network. The HITS program is a one-year program that supports investigators whose pilot projects test a new method or technique or propose innovative primary data collection. The HITS program is geared towards University of Minnesota LCC members across disciplines and career stages. Both programs leverage assets across Cores for administrative and research support, including fiscal management, grants management, human resources, reporting, human subjects, and dissemination of research findings.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the co-occurring period of racial trauma has upended family environments and\nexacted a toll on parents (mothers in particular), racial and ethnic minorities, and sexual minorities.\nUnderstanding how parents functioned during this time is crucial to identifying mechanisms linking race, gender,\nand sexual identity marginalization to disparities in parental well-being with critical implications for child health.\nLeveraging novel population-based survey and time diary data collected this past year from the National Couples\u2019\nHealth and Time Study (NCHAT), we will identify mechanisms underlying gender, racial and ethnic minority, and\nsexual minority disparities in parenting stress and parental well-being during COVID and this period of intense\nracial trauma. NCHAT (N = 3,642) is a population-representative study of individuals between 20 and 60 living\nin same and different-gender couples in the U.S. with oversamples of Black, Latinx, and Asian families and\nsexual minorities. The study includes 41% of partners as well. The analytic sample for this study focuses on the\n35% of the sample that had children under 18 (n = 1,274 main respondents; n = 567 partners). This project has\nfour specific aims: Aim 1. Determine gender, racial and ethnic minority, and sexual minority disparities in\nparenting stress and well-being and parent-child relationship quality and test marginalization, socioeconomic\nstatus, and adverse childhood experiences as mediators; Aim 2. Evaluate COVID and racial trauma stress,\npsychological distress, and couple relationship functioning as moderators of parenting stress and well-being and\nparent-child relationship quality disparities; Aim 3. Identify dyadic stress processes in the associations between\nCOVID and racial trauma stress, psychological distress, and relationship functioning and parenting; Aim 4.\nExamine community disruptions and context as moderators of parenting stress and well-being and parent-child\nrelationship quality disparities. Further, the NCHAT data, the contextual data produced for this project on\nstructural racism, sexism, and heterosexism, and NCHAT survey items for harmonization will be shared with the\nSocial, Behavioral, and Economic Research on COVID-19 Consortium Coordination Center (SBECCC) and the\nwider health research community, leveraging the exceptional resources of the Institute for Social Research and\nData Innovation (ISRDI), home to the IPUMS data projects. Forty percent of NCHAT main respondents identify\nracial and ethnic minorities, and 45% identify as sexual minorities. Data such as these are crucial to the success\nand inclusiveness of the SBECCC. This study aligns with the U01\u2019s intention to fund \u201cresearch to understand the\nhealth impacts of coronavirus mitigation strategies and the mechanisms that may convey risk and resilience,\nparticularly in underserved and vulnerable populations, [that] will help improve long-term responses to the\npandemic and prepare more effectively for the next public health emergency.\u201d Importantly, understanding family\nexperiences and strategies at this historical moment can inform interventions to address health detriments and\nbuild resiliency for the future of families.",

NCHAT is the only population-representative study (N = 3,642 ages 20-\n60) with large subsamples of sexual and gender diverse (SGD; 45%) and racially and ethnically diverse (RED;\n38%) coupled adults fielded during the pandemic with comprehensive measurement including groundbreaking\nstate and county structural racism, sexism, and cis heterosexism measures. The COVID-19 pandemic and the\nco-occurring period of intense racial trauma exacerbated and laid bare the health inequities experienced by RED\nand SGD populations in the US. Attacks on the SGD and RED populations are ongoing with alarming numbers\nof targeted harmful policies. Health disparities for RED and SGD populations are preventable, and identifying\ntheir social determinants and underlying mechanisms is urgent. Aim 1. Reinterview and refresh the NCHAT\nsample. We propose to collect four additional waves of survey data and two waves of time diary and experience\nsampling method data. These short and frequent surveys allow flexibility with the inclusion of new content\ntracking the impacts of period shocks, such as COVID-19 or the aftermath of racial trauma, and the factors that\nexacerbate or mitigate these impacts during an era of growing mental health crises. As nearly 30% of individuals\nin their twenties identify as SGD, a refresher and oversample to include 300 new respondents will be added.\nAim 2. Open the NCHAT panel so a diverse body of health equity scholars drive question content. Current\npopulation data infrastructure on health disparities is outmoded because 1) only select researchers decide on\nsurvey content and 2) a focus on repeated measurement can stymie innovation. Working with our inclusive\nadvisory board, we seek to upend this system and ignite cutting-edge research with the inclusion of items\ncontributed by health equity scholars across disciplines and institutions. These data will be rapidly released. Aim\n3. Assess SGD trajectories of mental health in an era of escalating threats to SGD families. We will test\nvulnerabilities (structural and interpersonal discrimination and SES); strengths (social support, SGD\nsocialization, identity centrality); and family functioning as mechanistic predictors during a period of growing anti-\nLGBTQ+ bills. Aim 4. Examine RED trajectories of mental health with a focus on recovery and\ndeterioration. We will evaluate how couple stability and relationship functioning, social and community support,\nand structural and interpersonal experiences of discrimination act as mediators and moderators of trajectories\nof mental health in the wake of the pandemic and continuing racial trauma. Without longitudinal data and flexible\nmeasurement, scientific knowledge about the mechanisms underlying RED and SGD disparities will be stymied.\nThis multi-disciplinary team is deeply invested and committed to ameliorating health disparities for RED and\nSGD populations. It is crucial that we expeditiously follow-up on these vulnerable populations and give voice to\na broad range of scholars seeking health equity for all.",

    "abstract_text": "Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is a devastating, frequently disfiguring, and often\nfatal disease, expected to affect more than 53,000 people in the U.S. in 2020 and kill more than 10,000.\nPrevention of this terrible disease is critical. Cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and human papilloma\nvirus (HPV) are well established major causes of HNSCC; only smoking and alcohol consumption are\nconsidered here. Cigarette smoking and alcoholic drinks are sources of multiple DNA adducts that are critical\nin the carcinogenic process. This proposal will establish a liquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray ionization-\nhigh resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-NSI-HRMS/MS) profile analysis of 12 oral cell DNA adducts\nthat are likely causes of HNSCC. This was inspired by our recent analysis of DNA adducts in oral cells, in\nwhich we found levels more than 20 times higher in cigarette smokers than in non-smokers. These exciting\nresults encouraged us to propose a profile analysis of important carcinogen-derived DNA adducts in oral cells\naccording to the following specific aims:\n1. Develop an LC-NSI-HRMS/MS profile analysis method for quantitation of 12 important and representative\n carcinogen and toxicant \u2013 DNA adducts in human oral cells and tissue. The adducts are derived from\n various carcinogens and DNA reactive compounds in cigarette smoke and alcoholic beverages.\n2. Apply the profile analysis to oral cells from currently healthy individuals: a) 100 non-smokers who are non-\n drinkers or light drinkers; b) 100 cigarette smokers who are non-drinkers or light drinkers; and c) 100\n cigarette smokers who are moderate or heavy drinkers. Comparisons of adduct levels in groups a and b\n will identify adducts enhanced by cigarette smoking while comparisons of groups b and c will identify\n adducts that are enhanced by the combination of smoking and moderate or heavy drinking.\n3. Test the longitudinal stability of the oral cell DNA adduct profile analysis over a 6 month period in 50\n smokers who are non-drinkers or light drinkers.\n4. A) Determine the DNA adduct profile in oral cells collected from 75 smokers with HNSCC and compare to\n that in 200 smokers without HNSCC recruited in Specific Aim 2 with the goal of identifying an adduct profile\n that is characteristic of HNSCC incidence.\n B) Compare the oral cell DNA adduct profile from part A of this aim to that in tissue, both normal and\n tumor, in a subset of 60 patients from part A who undergo surgery, to determine whether oral cell DNA\n adduct patterns are consistent with those in tissue.\nOur results will potentially identify individuals who are susceptible to HNSCC but are unable to quit smoking.\nOnce identified, aggressive lifestyle and monitoring interventions in these subjects such as oral examinations\n2-4 times per year can be initiated for prevention or early detection of this disfiguring and often fatal cancer.",

More lung cancer cases in the U.S. (50.8%) now\noccur in former smokers than in current smokers (36.7%), yet we know little about the relevant biochemical\nmechanisms and related potential biomarkers that could ultimately be used to identify those at high risk. This\nproject proposes to investigate chemical and metabolic biomarkers in former smokers.\nThe Specific Aims are to:\n 1) Perform a clinical study of inhaled [D10]phenanthrene ([D10]Phe) to determine the ratio of urinary\n [D10]phenanthrene tetraol ([D10]PheT) to [D9]phenanthrene phenols ([D9]PhOH) as an indicator of\n increased metabolic activation of PAH in the lungs of former smokers compared to never smokers,\n possibly due to pleural anthracosis (the accumulation of black particles in the lungs of smokers which\n persist in former smokers;\n 2) Perform a clinical study of inhaled [13C18]linoleic acid to determine levels of [13C]mercapturic acids of\n acrolein, 4-hydroxynonenal and related \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds in the urine of former\n smokers compared to never smokers to investigate the hypothesis that pulmonary inflammation leads to\n production of these urinary metabolites;\n 3) Quantify the inflammation and oxidative damage-related adducts 1,N6-etheno-dA, 3,N4-etheno-dC, \u0263-OH-\n propano-dG, and 8-oxo-dG in DNA from oral cells and leukocytes of former smokers compared to never\n smokers; and\n 4) Working together with Core B, quantify biomarkers of potential harm - myeloperoxidase activity in\n plasma, IL-6, IL-8, and C-reactive protein levels in serum, and urinary levels of 8-epi-PGF2\u03b1 and\n prostaglandin E metabolite (PGEM) in former and never smokers. Serum levels of \u03b1-tocopherol,\n protective against lung cancer, will also be quantified.\nCollaborative studies with Projects 1 and 3 are also proposed.

Project 2, \u201cCYP2A6 genetic score, nicotine metabolism, and lung\ncancer\u201d will focus on the primary catalyst of nicotine metabolism which is critical because people with low\nactivity of this enzyme smoke fewer cigarettes and smoke those less intensely because they need less\nnicotine, which is proposed to lead to lower lung cancer risk. Project 3, \u201cUntargeted adductomics to\ncharacterize ethnic differences in the exposome of smokers\u201d hypothesizes that biological responses towards\ncigarette smoke exposure differ among individuals and ethnic groups due to genetic and/or epigenetic factors\nthat lead to differences in metabolic and inflammatory responses to smoking. Project 4, \u201cCarcinogenesis\nbiomarkers in former smokers of the Multiethnic Cohort Study\u201d will use a unique approach to determine the\nmetabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as lipid peroxidation in the lungs of former\nsmokers compared to never smokers. These 4 projects will be supported by 3 outstanding Cores:\nAdministrative Core, Clinical and Biomarkers Core, and Biostatistics Core. Thus, our experienced investigators\npropose to continue their superb and unique teamwork to make significant progress in understanding lung\ncancer mechanisms among present and former cigarette smokers leading to new insights for prevention of\nfatal lung cancer.",

    "abstract_text": "Neurostimulation, including invasive methods like deep brain stimulation (DBS), is an increasingly important approach to treating mental illness. It offers the possibility of directly targeting the circuit dysfunctions that produce mental disorders. The clinical use of brain stimulation, and DBS in particular, has been limited by a lack of mechanistic understanding. We do not know why/how stimulating a specific region or pathway leads to symptom improvement. This limits our ability to correctly \u201cdose\u201d stimulation, or to verify biological target engagement. Further, mechanisms are difficult to dissect in humans, because (A) we cannot easily capture stimulation\u2019s effects on brain circuits and (B) human patients cannot tolerate the many repeated experiments needed to map stimulation parameter space. Detailed network/mechanism mapping is possible in animals, but common animal models of psychiatric illness are not strong mirrors of human disease. This project attempts to overcome those barriers by modeling psychiatric DBS\u2019 mechanisms through the lens of cognitive function \u2013 behaviors that can be more rigorously measured in both humans and animals. Specifically, we recently showed that DBS of the ventral internal capsule/ventral striatum (VCVS), acts in part by improving patients\u2019 executive function. In two human studies, we showed that VCVS DBS augments cognitive control \u2013 the ability to withhold a habitual/default response in favor of a more goal-aligned option. Further, this augmentation translates across species. We applied DBS-like stimulation to a rat homologue of VCVS, during a cognitive control task similar to our human paradigm. We saw improvements that very closely tracked our human results. We now propose to use that reverse-translational model to identify which cellular/circuit elements and neural activity variables mediate this behavioral improvement. A dominant theory argues that DBS in psychiatry works through white matter, e.g. by retrograde modulation of PFC through cortico-thalamic axons in VCVS. Our data suggest, however, that changes in local striatal activity are also important. We will replace electrical DBS with population-restricted optogenetic stimulation, mapping the contributions of individual cortico-thalamic circuits (Aim 1) and striatal sub-regions (Aim 2). During those manipulations, we will record spikes and LFP, at multiple sites within the cortico-striatal cognitive control circuitry. We will identify which variables are most strongly changed by DBS-like stimulation and correlate with behavior change (Aim 3). Success would identify putative mechanisms of a promising neurostimulation therapy, with near-term clinical implications. Technologies already exist to steer the DBS electric field to target specific axons/nuclei, and to titrate stimulation based on physiologic measures. The PI is a DBS psychiatrist, and could use those approaches in his own clinical program to target the mechanisms we identify.",

The overall theme of the UMN Udall\nCenter is to develop novel, circuit based deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).\nAs a foundation for all three proposed projects, the Catalyst project and in collaboration with the other cores in\nsupport of this theme, the overall goal of the Imaging Core is to use advanced imaging capabilities for direct\nvisualization of anatomical targets for DBS surgery as well as provide the precise location and orientation of\nindividual stimulating electrode contacts within the target post-implantation.\nThe Imaging Core will combine several cutting-edge MRI techniques, including high resolution T1/T2s and\nsusceptibility weighted images (SWI). Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) will also be acquired for white-matter\ntractography to create patient-specific anatomical models of the target region and associated networks. To\ncomplement the static anatomical connectivity information, we will create functional connectivity maps using\nresting-state and task based functional MRI (fMRI) data of circuit-based cognitive function/non-motor regions.\nFor Projects 1, 2 and the Catalyst, PD patients will be scanned on a 7 T MRI system using tools developed by\nour team at the CMRR. In addition, in a subset of PD patients that will be implanted with the Medtronic Percept\nsystem, functional maps of DBS-fMRI stimulation will be collected on a 3T MRI system. For Project 3, non-human\nprimates (NHPs) will be scanned on the newly installed, first of its kind, 10.5 T MRI scanner, also at the CMRR.\nFor each PD patient and each NHP, the Imaging Core will acquire high-resolution MRI data prior to DBS\nimplantation and a head CT scan after surgery. Images will be fused to provide a comprehensive anatomical\nmodel of the DBS target and the precise location of individual DBS contacts within each target.\nThe Imaging Core will provide patient-specific anatomical models, precise post-surgery DBS lead localization,\nand parcellation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) to their\nfunctional sub-regions. These images will provide unparalleled anatomical characterization specific to each\nindividual.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal disease notoriously resistant to therapy including immune\ncheckpoint blockade. Meanwhile, immunotherapy targeting the PD-1:PD-L1 pathway is inducing stunning\nclinical outcomes in other advanced malignancies. Despite decades of cancer immunology research, the\nunderlying mechanisms governing immune surveillance in pancreas cancer are largely unknown. This is due,\nin part, to a lack of animal models that permit the detection of tumor-specific T lymphocytes during disparate\nclinical outcomes commonly observed in patients. We have filled this knowledge gap by creating novel animal\nmodels that permit the interrogation or the rare tumor-antigen specific T cells over time. Based on our recent\ndiscoveries, we are now uniquely poised to identify how to safely promote antigen-specific T cell-mediated\ndestruction of pancreas cancer, and our proposal will use these results to develop a novel preclinical\ncombination immune-based therapy to inform a clinical trial. Our compelling preliminary data support the\nhypothesis that immune-mediated pancreas cancer eradication requires a combination of a 1) high affinity\ntumor specific T cell, 2) modifying suppressive intratumoral myeloid cells, and 3) overcoming chronic\ninflammatory signaling mediated by TNF\u03b1. We screened a series of immunotherapies and identified that\nagonistic \u03b1CD40 or PD-L1 blockade has only transient antitumor activity whereas the combination leads to\ntumor eradication in 63% of animals. PD-L1 blockade failed to reinvigorate intratumoral T cell functions and\ninstead changed the peripheral tumor-specific T cell repertoire and expands a unique peripheral T cell\nsubpopulation enriched for pro-survival genes and Ikzf2. In contrast, agonistic \u03b1CD40 promotes potent, yet\nshort-lived, cytolytic intratumoral T cells which correlates with a decrease in intratumoral myeloid cell IL-27\nproduction. Finally, abrogating Tnfr1 expression by non-tumor/host cells overcomes tumor escape resulting in\n100% of tumor eradication in \u03b1CD40+\u03b1PD-L1-treated animals. In Aim 1, we will identify the functional\nsignificance of the altered TCR repertoire and the Ikzf2+ T cell subpopulation induced following PD-L1\nblockade. In Aim 2, we will test if agonistic \u03b1CD40 promotes potent cytolytic effector T cells by abrogating\nintratumoral myeloid cell production of IL-27 and/or CD8 T cell production of IL-10. In Aim 3, we will identify\nhow IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 signaling on non-tumor/host cells lead to disparate outcomes following combination\nimmunotherapy of pancreas cancer and test a novel combinatorial immunotherapy that includes TNF\u03b1\nblockade in combination with a CD40 agonist and a PD-1 inhibitor. The studies are designed to identify a\nmechanistic basis for T cell dysfunction in pancreas cancer and to create a feasible clinical strategy to\novercome it with the goal to create a safe and effective immune-based treatment for pancreas cancer patients.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\n In response to PAR-19-269, \u201cCognitive Systems Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Genetic and Phenotypic\nData\u201d, we propose developing and applying more powerful and robust machine learning methods for causal and\nintegrative analysis, especially deep learning approaches for instrumental variable analysis, to identify causal\nrisk/protective factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the post-GWAS era by leveraging published large-scale\nGWAS, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other omic and neuroimaging data. Our main motivation is to ex-\ntend an emerging and increasingly in\ufb02uential approach of integrating GWAS with gene expression data, called\ntranscriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), aiming to improve over the current practice of GWAS by not only\nincreasing statistical power, but also identifying (putative) causal genes, thus gaining insights into the genetic basis\nof common diseases and complex traits. The statistical principle underlying TWAS is the (two-sample) two-stage\nleast squares (2SLS) for linear models in the framework of instrumental variable (IV) analysis for causal inference.\nIn practice, however, TWAS may fail to identify true causal genes while giving false positives due to the violation\nof its modeling assumptions, e.g., due to non-linear effects of IVs or gene expression, or due to invalid IVs (in the\npresence of horizontal pleiotropy of SNPs). First, we propose developing linear models and neural network models\nincorporating a large number of functional annotations on the genome (e.g. various types of functional genomic\nand epigenetic data from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects) as prior knowledge to improve im-\nputing/predicting gene expression (or other molecular or imaging endophenotypes or complex traits/diseases) via\nSNPs, corresponding to the \ufb01rst stage of 2SLS. Second, we propose neural networks as more \ufb02exible non-linear\nmodels for the second stage of 2SLS in the presence of invalid IVs, which may be the SNPs having direct (or\nhorizontal pleiotropic) effects on the outcome as expected from the wide-spread pleiotropy. Then we combine the\napproaches in the above two stages to form a more \ufb02exible and robust neural network approach as an extension of\n2SLS for causal inference. Third, we consider inferring causal directions between two traits, e.g. a gene's expres-\nsion and AD, allowing non-linear relationships between SNPs and traits and between the two traits. This is critical\nin reducing false positives, e.g. due to reverse causation, but has been largely under-studied. Fourth, we apply the\nnew (and existing) methods to transcriptomic, proteomic, neuroimaging and AD GWAS/WGS data to identify (pu-\ntative) causal genes, proteins and brain regions of interest (ROIs) for AD, while building the corresponding genetic\nprediction models for endophenotypes and AD risk. Finally, we will develop and disseminate publicly available\nsoftware implementing the proposed analysis methods, e.g. as Python programs or R packages, to facilitate the\nwide use by the scienti\ufb01c community.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe long-term goal of this research is to define the mechanisms of action of a successful cell transplantation\ntherapy for chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and to translate this knowledge from bench to bedside for patients.\nHuman SCI currently has no effective treatment, and any new treatments would have a significant impact on\npublic health. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine whether transplantation of regionally specific\nbioprinted spinal neural progenitor cells (sNPCs) in combination with a 3D printed scaffold can result in the\nformation of functional neuronal networks within the injured adult rat spinal cord. We have three specific aims.\nThe first aim is to optimize the biomaterial and design of the 3D printed scaffold, as well as the cell-laden bioink\nutilized in bioprinting. The second aim is to determine the optimal cell configuration of two types of regionally\nspecific sNPCs within the scaffold to form functional neuronal networks. The third aim is to test our scaffold in a\nrat model of transection injury to determine whether our cells can provide a relay system across the site of injury,\nand whether this will result in functional recovery. We will perform detailed functional, histological, and\nelectrophysiological analyses to elucidate the mechanisms of our combinatorial treatment. The scientific\npremise is that there is a synergistic relationship in providing the substrate (cells) for a relay system across the\ninjury site and optimizing this with a conduit (scaffold), providing an effective relay for neuronal signaling leading\nto functional recovery.",

Therefore, the\nUniversity of Minnesota, the University of Iowa, and University of Utah have formed the\nInterdisciplinary Training, Education and Research Activities for Assessing And Controlling\nContaminants From Emerging Technologies (INTERACCT) Program. The objectives of the\nINTERACCT Program for this funding period are (i) to develop a comprehensive web-based\ncurriculum on occupational hygiene, with emphasis on applications to worker health and safety in\nemerging technologies. To accomplish this objective, we will develop three online core courses for\neducation and training in chemical hazard recognition, exposure assessment, and risk assessment.\nIn the cores, we will demonstrate concepts with examples and illustrations drawn from the following\nemerging technologies: nanotechnology, additive manufacturing and novel drug delivery. Each\ncore in the curriculum will be comprised of 10-15 web-based modules; each module, in turn, will\ninclude a carefully-constructed set of short narrated screencasts, animations, exercises, and\nactivities. (ii) to build research in industrial hygiene skills. To accomplish this objective, we will\nprovide interdisciplinary research experience opportunities to graduate students. (iii) To produce\ngraduates with high levels of technical, scientific and proessional competency. To accomplish this\nobjective, Instructors will use the curriculum to create academic and continuing education courses\nthat develop the skills of industrial hygiene students; students in other health, science, engineering,\nand technology disciplines; and professionals who require continuing education on the health and\nsafety of emerging technologies. The program is innovative because it provides flexible, online\neducation materials that instructors can first use to train themselves, and then to train others, on\ntopics that fit the needs of their organizations. All materials will be freely available on the web,\nensuring that the INTERACCT Program has a regional, national, and global reach.",

The overall aim of this site proposal is for the University of\nMinnesota Masonic Children's Hospital (UMMCH), under the leadership of Site Principal Investigator, Marie\nSteiner, MD, MS, to join this expanded iteration of CPCCRN. UMMCH is a free-standing, quaternary care,\nacademic children\u2019s hospital located in Minneapolis, MN, serving children and families across a diverse range\nof racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. It has a 24-bed mixed medical/surgical and cardiac pediatric\nintensive care unit and offers the full spectrum of pediatric and surgical subspecialty services. UMMCH has a\nstrong history of clinical research and innovation in conjunction with the resources of the University of\nMinnesota, the state\u2019s land grant university. Pediatric critical care research includes numerous completed and\nongoing studies championed by multiple faculty, including the Co-Investigators for this grant. With increasing\nsupport from internal and external grants and the development of the Pediatric Device Innovation Center, the\nDivision was third in the Department in launching new studies in 2019, behind Hematology/Oncology and\nHSCT. Children's Minnesota (Children\u2019s) will serve as our Ancillary Site under the leadership of Alberto\nOrioles, MD. Children\u2019s is a not-for-profit, freestanding children\u2019s hospital also located in Minneapolis, with a\nlong-standing history of participation in critical care research, including several CPCCRN studies. Together,\nUMMCH and Children's will provide access to 55 pediatric ICU beds and over 3500 annual admissions, which\ncaptures the majority of critically ill children throughout the Upper Midwest and will facilitate participation in\nlarge clinical trials. The proposed \u201cPersonalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-Induced Multiple Organ\nDysfunction Syndrome (MODS)\u201d trial addresses the hypothesis that immunosuppressed children will benefit\nfrom administration of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and that children with\nhyperinflammation will benefit from targeted anti-inflammatory therapy. Benefit will be evaluated in terms of\nrecovery from MODS, as well as short- and long-term health-related quality of life measures. This partnership\nhas the knowledge and skills to successfully complete this trial, including sample collection and processing for\nimmunophenotyping and collection of short- and long-term outcomes. Drs. Steiner and Orioles have the full\nsupport of their respective institutions to participate in CPCCRN and to prioritize patient recruitment and\naccrual to its studies. The institutions are strongly committed to collaboration with CPCCRN sites and the Data\nCoordinating Center to conduct the proposed and future research. Our clinical center and ancillary site will\nprovide local mentorship for our highly talented young faculty and will support their participation in the central\nCPCCRN mentoring activities that are described in Section B.3 of the required CPCCRN Network\nOrganizational Structure attachment to the Overall Component of this PL1 application.",

She will train under the mentorship of a transdisciplinary group of senior scientists with\nresearch expertise in behavioral clinical trials, stakeholder-engaged intervention development, qualitative\nresearch methods, and interpersonal theories and methods. She will continue working with her current T32\nmentors, Drs. Jun Ma and Megan Lewis, both of whom have extensive experience mentoring trainees. This will\nbe complemented by content and mentoring expertise from Drs. Bethany Barone Gibbs, Elizabeth Skidmore,\nand Dilip Pandey. Collectively, this team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow Dr.\nKringle to fill critical gaps in her knowledge and skill set relating to the study of lifestyles interventions and\ninterpersonal social dynamics that influence post-stroke sedentary behavior and quality of life. Her training\ngoals are to develop skills in (1) design and analyses of conventional and contemporary behavioral clinical\ntrials, (2) qualitative analyses of stakeholder engagement data, (3) theory, measurement, and analyses of\ninterpersonal (dyadic) influences on post-stroke health behaviors, and (4) professional skills in interdisciplinary\nteam science and scientific leadership. Achieving these goals will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish\nimportant collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. To\nthis end, Dr. Kringle\u2019s proposed research plan that builds directly on her prior work developing the Activating\nBehavior for Lasting Engagement (ABLE) intervention. ABLE uses behavioral activation to reduce post-stroke\nsedentary behavior. Reducing sedentary behavior is particularly important for promoting health in the context\nof stroke-related disability. Even if impairments (motor, cognitive, sensory) fully resolve, stroke survivors do not\nautomatically re-engage in non-sedentary activities as impairments diminish. Further, residual impairments,\nsocial influences (protective care providers), and environmental factors (transportation, accessibility) create\nbarriers to engagement in personally meaningful non-sedentary daily activities. The purpose of this proposal is\nto adapt ABLE to telehealth (teleABLE), targeting the first year post-stroke, and evaluate its acceptability,\nfidelity, and potential effects in a pilot randomized clinical trial. We will also explore factors that are potential\nmoderators or theoretically driven mediators of intervention outcomes. Embedded within this trial is data\ncollection from stroke survivors\u2019 social support person to explore interpersonal (dyadic) influences on post-\nstroke sedentary behavior. Findings from this study, in combination with the career development plan, will\nenable Dr. Kringle to launch an independent program of research that aims to 1) develop interventions that\nreduce post-stroke sedentary behavior to enhance health and quality of life, and 2) elucidate the role of\ninterpersonal social dynamics in health behaviors and quality of life among adults with stroke-related disability.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nOvarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the U.S. Earlier detection is the key to\nincreased survival for women with ovarian cancer, yet a screening tool that is both sensitive and specific\nenough for use in the general population has yet to be developed. In contrast, screening for cervical cancer by\nPap tests has been routinely performed for over 50 years. In the liquid-based Pap test, cells are collected from\nthe cervical opening and placed into an alcohol-based fixative and then examined for abnormal cells. Since\novarian cancer cells have been observed in Pap tests, ovarian cancer peptide biomarkers may also be\npresent; yet Pap samples have not been rigorously examined for diagnostic peptides. Our central hypothesis\nis that proteins shed by ovarian cancer cells can be detected in the Pap test fixative and on cervical-vaginal\nswabs by Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. The Pap test fixative and swabs are ideal for biomarker\ndiscovery since they are derived from a site proximal to the ovarian cancer (i.e. proteins may be secreted or\nshed from the tumor and flow through the fallopian tube into the uterus and out the cervical opening).\nRecently, ovarian cancer precursor lesions have been identified in the fimbria of the fallopian tube,\nstrengthening the hypothesis that ovarian cancer proteins will be found in the lower genital tract, perhaps even\nat early stages. In preliminary studies, candidate biomarkers were successfully identified by MS-based\nproteomics in Pap test fixatives from women with ovarian cancer, and the levels of biomarker peptides were\nquantified in cases vs. benign and healthy controls, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. The long-\nterm goal of this project is to develop a noninvasive screening test that can be incorporated into a routine Pap\ntest or a self-administered home test, so that women can be screened simultaneously for cervical and ovarian\ncancer. The objective of this study is to verify ovarian cancer biomarker peptides identified in Pap test samples\nand extend the results to cervical swabs, using our collection of biospecimens from over 600 patients and\ncontrols. Aim #1 will build on our preliminary studies to prioritize ovarian cancer biomarker candidates found in\nliquid-based Pap test samples by performing Tandem Mass Tag\u2122 11-plex isobaric labeling, 2D LC-MS/MS,\nand bioinformatics integration. In Aim #2, the most robust candidate biomarkers will be quantified by\ndeveloping a targeted Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM)-MS assay coupled with a multi-protein classifier,\nwhich will then be used to test hundreds of Pap test samples from women with ovarian cancer, other\ngynecologic cancers, and benign gynecologic conditions, as well as healthy women. In Aim #3, proteins eluted\nfrom cervical swabs will be tested to determine whether they are also detected by our SRM-MS assay. Results\nfrom this study may be extended to the early detection of ovarian cancer in women in high risk groups and\neventually for screening the general population, thereby shifting the paradigm for how women are screened for\novarian cancer and improving survival rates for the >22,000 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year.",

    "abstract_text": "Pain associated with primary and metastatic bone tumors is often severe and difficult to manage. Opioids are\nfirst-line treatment for severe cancer pain, but their side effects, including tolerance, addiction and respiratory\ndepression, limit their use. The search for opioid alternatives with high analgesic efficacy and low adverse\neffects has yielded limited success. Long-term goal is to identify novel, effective, and safe alternatives to\nopioids for pain treatment. This project is focused on Resolvin D1 (RvD1), an endogenous derivative of \uf077-3\npolyunsaturated fatty acids, as a possible therapeutic for cancer pain. Using a mouse model of bone cancer\npain. Preliminary data show that systemic administration of RvD1 decreased cancer-evoked hyperalgesia,\nattenuated sensitization of nociceptors and nociceptive dorsal horn neurons, and reduced descending\nfacilitation while increasing descending inhibition of nociceptive transmission from the rostral ventromedial\nmedulla (RVM). RvD1 did not impair motor function and did not produce place preference, suggesting it is not\naddictive. The overall objective in this proposal is to determine peripheral and central underlying mechanisms\nof RvD1 exerts analgesia. The central hypothesis is that systemic administration of RvD1 inhibits enzymes\ninvolved in the biosynthesis of pronociceptive prostaglandins (PGs) and the hydrolysis of antinociceptive\nendocannabinoids (eCBs) that reduce sensitization of nociceptive neurons and inhibit descending facilitation.\nPreliminary data suggest that increased PGs and decreased eCBs in the DRG, spinal cord and RVM\ncontribute to neuronal sensitization and pain during cancer. Because RvD1 increased eCBs, role of different\ntypes of cannabinoid receptors in RvD1 produced antinociception will be elucidated. The central hypothesis will\nbe tested in three specific aims. 1) Identify molecular mechanisms of RvD1 antinociception in the peripheral\nand central nervous system; 2) Determine functional effects of RvD1 on nociceptive primary afferent and spinal\nneurons during cancer-induced bone pain; and 3) Determine functional effects of RvD1 on descending\nfacilitation and inhibition from the RVM. For the first aim biochemical and molecular approaches will be used to\ndetermine changes in prostaglandin and endocannabinoid signaling during the development of cancer- pain\nand the effects of Resolvin D1. The second aim will investigate the effects of Resolvin D1 on sensitization of\nnociceptors and dorsal horn neurons using in vivo electrophysiological and in vitro [Ca2+]i-imaging\napproaches. The third aim will evaluate the effects of RvD1 on descending facilitation and inhibition by\ndetermining if RvD1 reduces activity of ON cells and increases activity of OFF cells in the RVM and how it\naffect nociceptive transmission in spinal dorsal horn neurons. The proposed research is innovative because it\nwill uncover novel mechanisms by which RvD1 reduces cancer pain.

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nAntiseizure medications are one of the most commonly prescribed teratogens. In pregnant women with\nepilepsy, continuation of antiseizure medications and dose increases are often necessary to prevent\nseizure worsening, but need to be balanced against the fetal risks of in utero exposure, such as congenital\nmalformations and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Additionally, breastfeeding introduces another\nroute of drug exposure to the infant and can affect child development. Although measurement of drug\nconcentration in plasma is thought to reflect drug concentrations at the site of action in the mother, it is more\ndifficult to translate the overall exposure to the fetus or determine the full extent of the exposure to the child\nthrough breastfeeding. Physiological-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) methods will be used to advance a\nprecision medicine approach to characterize drug concentration-time profiles at the tissue level allowing\nevaluation of target doses needed to achieve optimal drug exposure in women with epilepsy, taking into\naccount drug exposure to the fetus during pregnancy and to the breastfeeding infant. Information from both\nbasic science and clinical studies will be used to develop, evaluate, and validate PBPK models. This grant will\nuse previously collected data and new measures from existing samples in the clinical study MONEAD, animal\ndata, in vitro studies, and a new external validation cohort with sampling at critical timepoints (not previously\nobtained) to determine the mechanistic basis of alterations in antiseizure medication concentrations during\npregnancy and lactation. These data can then be combined with outcome data in other clinical studies to\nexpand our knowledge of drug response and safety in women and children during two very vulnerable times,\npregnancy and lactation.",

    "abstract_text": "Arboviruses such as, Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV), have been associated with several global epidemics.\nDENV infections can result in a mild fever to potentially fatal dengue shock syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever\nand death, while ZIKV infections can result in congenital microcephaly and the development of autoimmune\ndiseases. Initial clinical manifestation of DENV and ZIKV disease are similar and co-infections have been\nreported. Most challenging, DENV and ZIKV are known to co-circulate, increasing the probability of co-infections,\nand thus the potential for severe disease. Consequently, since there is no effective vaccine or form of treatment\nfor either virus, the development of anti-ZIKV and anti-DENV therapeutics is an urgent unmet medical need.\n Over the past decade prodrugs of nucleotides, referred to as ProTides, have been found to have potent\nantiviral activity. The anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug sofosbuvir (FDA approved 2013) is the most notable\nProTide success, since its use in combination therapy can clear Hepatis C virus infections. Recently, a similar\nProTide, remdesivir, has been approved by the FDA, Japan, the European Union an Australia for the treatment\nof severe SARs-CoV-2 infections by intravenous injection. Carboxyesterase-anhydride-HINT1 (CAH) ProTides,\nsuch as sofosbuvir and remdesivir, utilize a four step activation process based on initial esterase hydrolysis,\ncarboxylic acid nucleophilic attack at the phosphorous and release of phenol, followed by mixed anhydride\nchemical hydrolysis, and finally phosphoramidate hydrolysis by hHINT1. Unfortunately, although they can be\ndosed intravenously, due to high first pass metabolism, CAH-Protides are limited in their use as oral drugs to\nviral hepatitis. Furthermore, due to the high carboxyesterase activity of rodent plasma, it has been difficult to\ncarry out pre-clinical studies with rodents and translationally relevant dosages of CAH-ProTides.\n To address the inherent issues surrounding current ProTide approaches, our group has\ndesigned an alternative ProTide approach, we refer to as anchimerically HINT1 activated proTides\n(AHA-ProTides). Our laboratory has demonstrated that AHA-proTides can be designed that are stable,\norally bioavailable, cell permeable and dependent on HINT phosphoramidate hydrolysis. Recently, we\nhave also demonstrated that AHA proTides can be prepared with enhanced potency against DENV\nand ZIKV. Consequently, we propose to the design and develop anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV AHA\nProTides that can serve as advanced lead compounds for the potential treatment of both DENV\nand ZIKV disease.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Abstract/Summary\nDevelopment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) prior to the age of 20 years has been associated with rapid disease\nprogression and early exogenous insulin dependence.1 Furthermore, adolescents with T2D are more likely to\ndevelop diabetes-related comorbidities, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and kidney disease earlier\ncompared to adults, highlighting the need for a fundamentally different (and perhaps more aggressive) treatment\napproach in adolescents.1 Obesity (body mass index [BMI] >95th percentile for age and sex) is a primary risk\nfactor for the development and progression of T2D.2,3 However, current treatment guidelines for T2D in\nadolescents recommend lifestyle management and metformin (+ insulin) as first-line therapy, which rarely result\nin BMI reduction or slowing of T2D disease progression.1,4-7 Therefore, novel treatments that meaningfully reduce\nBMI, delay exogenous insulin dependence, and potentially slow the progression of T2D need to be investigated\nin adolescents with T2D. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) may represent an ideal first-\nline therapy for adolescent T2D. GLP-1 RAs increase postprandial insulin secretion and reduce glucagon\nproduction, and at higher doses, can result in clinically meaningful BMI reduction by suppressing appetite and\nenhancing satiety.8 Liraglutide (a daily injectable GLP-1 RA) at its 1.8 mg/day dose was approved for adolescents\nwith T2D in 2019, but liraglutide has not been studied with a primary focus on BMI reduction and insulin sensitivity\nor \u00df-cell function in adolescents with T2D.9,10 Therefore, the overall objectives of this study will be to 1) evaluate\nthe effects of liraglutide at its obesity medicine dose (3.0 mg/day) versus standard-of-care on BMI reduction, and\n2) evaluate its effect on insulin sensitivity and \u03b2-cell function in adolescents with T2D and obesity. The overall\nhypothesis is that liraglutide 3.0 mg/day will result in a greater mean BMI percent change as well as\nimprovements in insulin sensitivity and \u03b2-cell function as compared to placebo plus standard-of-care. The focus\non using liraglutide at its obesity medicine dose in adolescents with T2D is novel and important; prior studies\nevaluating liraglutide have not been generalizable to adolescents with this aggressive disease nor have prior\nstudies had the majority of patients on the maximum liraglutide dose, making dose-dependent weight-loss\nevaluations difficult. The proposed study will generate preliminary data to inform the design of a larger and\nsufficiently-powered R01 trial. Importantly, this mentored project will provide essential training in clinical trial\ndesign and implementation in a unique and challenging patient population, as well as measures of insulin\nsensitivity/\u03b2-cell function. These skills will facilitate my scholarly independence and serve as the foundation of\nmy future career focusing on the application of obesity medicine principles in the treatment of adolescents with\nT2D.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nPreeclampsia is a complex disease of pregnancy involving cardiovascular, immune, and placental dysfunction.\nIt is the leading cause of maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality. Preventative options are poor and the only\neffective treatment is the delivery of the often pre-term fetus and the dysfunctional placenta. The current\nproposal aims to investigate the potential of personalized medicine in the form of cellular immunotherapy as\na novel preventative measure for the prevention of preeclampsia.\nElevated secretion of arginine vasopressin precedes the development of physiological symptoms of\npreeclampsia in humans, and infusion of vasopressin throughout gestation into wild-type mice is sufficient to\ninitiate the cardiovascular, renal, and immune dysregulation observed in human preeclampsia. Although\nvascular and renal complications are observed clinically in preeclampsia, immune dysfunction is central to the\npathogenesis of preeclampsia. Regulatory dendritic cells have been shown to induce immune tolerance and\nare a current cellular immunotherapy in ongoing clinical trials for several other immune mediated diseases.\nThe proposed study will test the hypothesize that treatment with regulatory dendritic cells will prevent the\ncardiovascular, renal, and immune features of preeclampsia.\nThe overall objective of this proposal is to determine if DCreg administration is a potential preventative for\npreeclampsia. In the following aims, utilizing the chronic AVP infusion mouse model of preeclampsia and primary\nhuman mononuclear cells, we will investigate 1) the potential of DCreg to prevent the cardiovascular, renal, and\nimmune features of preeclampsia in mice and 2) the ability of human mononuclear cells obtained from women\nwith chronic hypertension and/or preeclampsia to differentiate into functional DCreg.\nThe vision for my career is to develop an independent, NIH-funded research program that transforms women\u2019s\ncardiovascular healthcare through innovative scientific discovery and the education of future scientists. To\ncontinue to grow as an independent investigator and to achieve my career goals, the objective of the career\nplan is to develop skills in the following areas: 1) training in assessment of vascular function as it relates to\nmodels of preeclampsia; and 2) developing skills in translational clinical research. These will be accomplished\nthrough both didactic coursework and experiential training through direct interactions with my mentors and\ncolleagues.\nIf regulatory dendritic cells prevent preeclampsia in the present study, this data will identify a novel cellular\nimmunotherapy for preventing preeclampsia. Future studies would be aimed at further understanding the\nmechanism(s) of regulatory dendritic cell action and the potential of regulatory dendritic cells in preventing\npreeclampsia.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nNatural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that mediate cellular cytotoxicity against virally infected and\nmalignant cells. Upon activation, they also release chemokines and cytokines that help prime and coordinate the\nadaptive immune response. Because of these functional properties, there is continued interest in developing NK\ncell products for immunotherapy. However, this effort is hindered by our limited understanding of human NK cell\ndifferentiation and the transcription factor networks that regulate this process. In work supported by current\nK99/R00 funding, we generated a considerable amount of preliminary data comprehensively characterizing the\ntranscriptional and epigenetic landscapes in sorted NK and CD8+ T cell subsets isolated from cytomegalovirus\n(CMV) seropositive donors. To complement these analyses, we performed flow cytometry-based analyses of\ntranscription factor expression and ChIP-seq on sorted peripheral blood NK cell subsets to construct transcription\nfactor networks that potentially regulate key steps in NK cell differentiation. The culmination of this work revealed\na central role for Bcl11b. This was completely unexpected given several detailed studies in mice showing that\nBcl11b expression is restricted to the T, NKT, and ILC2 lineages and acts to enforce T cell identity. Our\npreliminary results also revealed a reciprocal relationship between Runx2 and Bcl11b, with Runx2 regulating a\nset of transcription factors enriched in immature NK cells and Bcl11b regulating genes enriched throughout\ncanonical NK cell maturation and in adaptive NK cells exhibiting a T cell-like gene expression signature. In this\napplication we will test the hypothesis that Runx2 is a major hub that enforces the epigenetic identity of immature\nCD56bright NK cells, while Bcl11b suppresses the Runx2-directed transcriptional program to drive canonical NK\ncell differentiation, maturation, and cytotoxic effector function. We also posit that high levels of Bcl11b contribute\nto the T cell-like features of CMV-induced adaptive NK cells.\n We propose two independent aims to test our hypotheses. In the first aim, we will use overexpression\nand knockdown strategies in sorted NK cell subsets to define the roles of Bcl11b and Runx2 during canonical\nNK cell differentiation. These results will guide subsequent experiments designed to determine whether Bcl11b\noverexpression in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) promotes NK cell maturation and effector function both\nin vitro and after adoptive transfer into mice with established tumors. In the second aim, we will determine the\nrole of Bcl11b in promoting T cell-associated features of CMV-induced adaptive NK cells and test the hypothesis\nthat high levels of Bcl11b along with activating receptor and cytokine receptor stimulation drives adaptive NK cell\ndifferentiation and maturation. We will also test the hypothesis that adaptive NK cells mediate superior antitumor\nfunction in vivo relative to canonical NK cells. Results generated from this proposal will define the role of Bcl11b\nin promoting canonical and adaptive NK cell differentiation, determine whether Bcl11b overexpression enhances\nNK cell-mediated antitumor activity, and definitively test the antitumor function of adaptive NK cells.",

Our overarching hypothesis is that NKG2C+ adaptive NK cells given in a setting of \u201cmissing self\u201d\nwill overcome suppressive mechanisms and mediate potent anti-AML activity and that targeting these cells with\nimmune engagers containing IL-15 will enhance their specificity to kill AML.

We developed our own IL-15-containing Tri-specific Killer\nEngager (161533 TriKE) comprised of three functional domains: 1) an NK cell-engaging single chain variable\nfragment (scFv) against CD16, 2) an AML-engaging scFv against CD33, and 3) an IL-15 linker between them.\nWe predict that the 161533 TriKE will target and activate endogenous NK cells to treat AML/MDS without\nbystander T cell activation. We produced the 161533 TriKE under GMP conditions, cleared an IND, and started\nclinical testing. However, NK cells are diminished in many cancers, and we believe that TriKE therapy might\nultimately prove most effective when combined with adoptive transfer of adaptive NK cells or other NK cell\nproducts. Using adaptive NK cells as a model, we developed an off-the-shelf induced pluripotent stem cell\n(iPSC)-derived NK cell product that expresses NKG2C/DAP12. When combined with an NKG2C TriKE, these\ncells become antigen specific. We have developed themes in Project 1 that will inform the Program on whether\nCMV-induced adaptive NK cells are optimal for cancer therapy, engage unique metabolic programs, can be\ntargeted with TriKEs, are more active in the setting of missing self, and can be mimicked in an off-the-shelf\nstrategy. Our Specific Aims are to 1) test a 2nd generation NKG2C+ adaptive cell product clinically in advanced\nAML/MDS; 2) test a CD33-targeted, IL-15-containing TriKE in a phase I trial in patients with AML/MDS; and 3)\npre-clinically test the combination of the two in xenogeneic models and test whether our iPSC-derived NK cell\nexpressing NKG2C can be targeted with an NKG2C-specific TriKE. Results from these studies will inform Project\n2 and 3 on the importance of NKG2C itself, optimization of targeting components within the TriKEs, and the\nimportance of missing self for clinical efficacy.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\n Executive function (EF) improves dramatically during childhood and adolescence, and failures of EF\nare associated with both a broad range of negative outcomes and diverse mental illnesses. The brain circuits\nresponsible for EF are spatially distributed, and include the fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, and salience\nsystems. These networks have typically been studied using standardized network atlases, which assume a\nstraightforward mapping between structural and functional neuroanatomy across individuals. However,\nmultiple independent efforts in adults using precision functional mapping techniques have recently\ndemonstrated that there is marked inter-individual variation in functional topography, which is defined as the\nspatial distribution of functional networks on the cortex. The over-arching hypothesis of this proposal is that\nindividual variation in functional topography is a critical determinant of EF in youth. Our collaborative team\nrecently published the first report of individualized functional networks in children using a cross-sectional\nsample (Cui et al., Neuron 2020). In this proposal, we will build upon this initial work by replicating and\ngeneralizing this finding using two large cross-sectional datasets with high-resolution imaging: the Healthy\nBrain Network (HBN; n=5,000) and Human Connectome Project: Development (HCP-D, n=1,300). Critically,\nwe will also leverage the unprecedented resources of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study\n(ABCD, n=11,572) to delineate within-subject change in personalized networks. In this proposal, we will first\nharmonize these massive data resources using advanced techniques originally developed for statistical\ngenomics (Aim 1). Next, we will describe how personalized networks evolve with age (Aim 2) and predict EF\n(Aim 3). Finally, we will use machine learning tools to discover how the functional topography of personalized\nexecutive networks predict dimensions of psychopathology in a data-driven manner (Exploratory Aim 4).\nThroughout, we will adhere to best practices of open science to maximize reproducibility, and ensure that all\nprocessed data, code, and results are openly shared with the neuroscience community. Together, this\nresearch will establish that functional topography is essential for understanding EF, and will motivate trials of\npersonalized neuromodulatory therapies.",

    "abstract_text": "7. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nPeriodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by the destruction of the periodontium and is the\nleading cause of tooth loss in adults. It is driven by a dysbiotic microbial biofilm that colonizes the gingival sulcus.\nWe seek to identify and characterize the local immune response to the microbial biofilm that leads to periodontitis.\nRecently, CD69 engagement on T regulatory cells was reported to induce immunosuppressive activities. A\nnatural ligand for CD69-mediated activation of Tregs is calprotectin (CLP; S100A8 complexed to S100A9;\nS100A8/A9; MRP8/14). When expressed in stratified squamous epithelia, this divalent cation-binding complex\nappears to contribute to intraepithelial antimicrobial defense. When released from infected or desquamating\nkeratinocytes or neutrophils, however, CLP may interact with CD69+ T regulatory or T helper 17 cells, ultimately\nsuppressing the immune response. If so, CLP may function during the initiation of\nperiodontitis contrary to its postulated function as a proinflammatory \u201calarmin\u201d. Using a global CLP null mouse,\nour preliminary data suggest that the net effect of CLP dampens the recruitment of an acute inflammatory infiltrate\nand limits periodontal bone destruction in a ligature-induced experimental periodontitis model. We will now\nexplore a modified mouse model of ligature-induced periodontitis primed with Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg).\nand in the resolution phase\nWe hypothesize that CLP signals through CD69 during the initiation\nand resolution phases\nof experimental\nperiodontal inflammation to dampen the destructive cellular infiltrate in the gingiva. To test our hypothesis, we\nwill: 1: Characterize the differences in the inflammatory cell infiltrate attributable to CLP during the initial\nand resolution phases\n of experimental periodontitis. 2: Determine how Pg-primed Treg cells modulate\nthe recruitment of the initial inflammatory cell infiltrates through CD69 signaling\nand CLP. 3: Determine the contribution of Pg-primed Th17 cells to modulating recruitment of the initial\nand resolution phase\nand resolution phase\ninflammatory cell infiltrates attributable to CD69 signaling and CLP. To our\nknowledge, we are the first group with data suggesting that CLP dampens the innate immune response in a\nCD69-dependent manner. We have the tools to explain how CLP contributes to recruitment of innate immune\ncells by affecting Treg and Th17 cells in vivo using a murine model of periodontitis. Ultimately, we will\ncharacterize how CLP and CD69 signaling in Treg and Th17 cells shapes the immune cell environment in the\ngingiva to drives either protection of periodontal tissues or destruction of alveolar bone. The results obtained\nhere will be used to design therapeutic interventions directed at boosting or inhibiting the activity of CLP. Critical\nsteps will be identified that might be amenable to targeted therapeutic intervention in humans. Ultimately we\naim to reduce the economic and personal burden of periodontal diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "The last decade ushered in amazing advances in neuroimaging due to transformative developments in magnetic resonance and optical imaging techniques as well as in computational and modeling tools. A common thread in these advances is their multi-disciplinary nature, requiring collaborations among medical researchers, engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and data scientists, among many others. In order to continue the pace of technical advances in neuroimaging and to exploit their unique capabilities for brain research and medical applications, it is critical to train the next generation of neuroimaging specialists in a setting 1) with an abundance of state-of-the-art tools, 2) with a programmatic interest in developing novel neuroimaging technologies and biomedical applications, and 3) where trainees can carry out groundbreaking research under multi-disciplinary mentorship. The University of Minnesota (UMN) has an excellent tradition of training neuroimaging postdocs in its Medical School and its College of Science & Engineering. It is also the home of major, world-renowned efforts in neuroimaging technology development and novel biomedical applications of neuroimaging. The proposed Minnesota Neuroimaging Postdoctoral Training Grant aims to give 14 postdoctoral fellows multi-disciplinary skills in neuroimaging technology development and advanced biomedical applications, guidance in career development, and social and networking support through intense two-year neuroimaging fellowships at UMN. Each fellow's primary research will be conducted on a multi-disciplinary project that combines their background with another field with the express goal of developing new neuroimaging technologies. Each fellow will be co-mentored by two faculty selected from the 40+ participating faculty in this grant: one that will directly supervise the research project, and one that represents a core area related to the research project. Fellows will take at least two courses to broaden their skillset and prepare for either an academic or industry research career. They will participate in an Annual Retreat and twice-monthly seminars that will cover research and career development topics such as responsible conduct of research, scientific rigor and reproducibility, grant writing, and other key subjects. They will also participate in UMN's numerous neuroscience conferences, symposia, and workshops, along with well-established UMN outreach programs to high schoolers and undergraduates interested in STEM fields. The program will be managed by an Executive Board. Management plans include a rigorous, ongoing evaluation process that incorporates an external Advisory Board and the University of Minnesota's internal research and assessment services.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nIn 2017, it was estimated that nearly 20% of the adult population in the U.S. live with a mental illness, yet much\nremains unknown about the pathophysiology of psychiatric disease and the specific behavioral symptomatology.\nAberrations in decision making and information processing have been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases\nlike schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and depression. Importantly,\ndysregulations in nucleus accumbens core (NAc core) dopamine signaling onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs)\nconstitute a key neural mechanism underlying these aberrant processes. Currently, NAc core research\ndisproportionately focuses on the motivation and reward-learning aspects of decision making. There is, however,\nstrong evidence that decision making involves more complex information-processing: making a decision requires\nevaluation of actual outcomes but also requires prospection and retrospection on imagined alternate outcomes.\nTherefore, it is important to investigate the role of dopamine release and MSN activity in information processing\nwhen agents prospectively imagine potential outcomes before making a decision through deliberation and when\nagents retrospectively imagine what could have been in the \u201cpath untraveled\u201d (counterfactual reasoning) or\nimagine poor time investments (sunk cost processing) after making a decision through reevaluation. Our\nunderstanding of how NAc core dopamine encodes these imagined outcomes during prospective deliberation\nand retrospective reevaluation is lacking greatly because there have not been behavioral tools with the\ncomplexity to probe the mechanisms contributing to this type of information-processing in rodents. Innovative\nwork in the Redish lab has led to the development of a rodent behavioral task, called Restaurant Row, whose\nintricacy allows for in-depth behavioral analysis of neuroeconomic behaviors. This proposal aims to elucidate\nhow NAc core dopamine dynamics reflect deliberation, counterfactual reasoning and sunk cost evaluation by 1)\nsimultaneous monitoring of in vivo dopamine release and MSN activity using fiber photometry 2) manipulating\nendogenous dopamine signaling at specific points in decision making. Restaurant Row has tremendous\ntranslational potential and has been adapted for non-human primates and humans. Thus, the work proposed\nhere will contribute to a larger translational collaboration in the future to investigate these questions across\nspecies through collaboration with my clinical mentors in the Department of Psychiatry. My advisors Dr. David\nRedish and Dr. Patrick Rothwell are equipped to mentor me both technically and professionally and together we\nhave curated a training plan that perfectly aligns with my career goals. By incorporating pioneering techniques\ninto a translational project in such an interdisciplinary environment will provide the training I need to develop\nbecome a successful physician-scientist contributing to the field of computational psychiatry.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\nRural Americans face disproportionate cardiovascular disease burden, yet they must travel farther to reach\nhospitals that can provide effective, guideline-concordant treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\nTransfer networks play a crucial role in care for rural ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), the most\nsevere form of AMI, moving patients from rural hospitals to hospitals that can perform primary Percutaneous\nCoronary Intervention (PCI), the preferred treatment for STEMI. Of the 925 hospitals have closed or been\nacquired in rural areas since 2007, 75% may have been part of a STEMI transfer network. Although closures\nand acquisitions of hospitals may disrupt STEMI transfer network, the impact on STEMI patients has not been\nexplored. Existing research on hospital closures finds conflicting results on AMI mortality. Failure to account for\nnetworks disadvantages previous research in 3 ways. 1) Time to PCI depends on the geographic location and\nthe transfer relationships of hospitals within STEMI transfer networks. 2) Disruptions can cause spillover\neffects to patients not directly affected by closures and acquisitions but in the same transfer network. 3) The\ncharacteristics of network affect time to PCI after disruption. Although not previously explored, disruptions in\nrural STEMI networks could worsen rural-urban disparities in AMI mortality rates and reverse reductions in\nrural cardiovascular mortality over the past four decades. This project will draw upon novel data resources\ncollected by the research team including validated data on hospital closure status and timing and validated\ndata on hospital-level PCI capabilities. Leveraging the expertise of the research team in innovative network\nanalysis techniques, invasive cardiology, emergency medicine, rural health, Medicare claims data, and\nbiostatistics we will estimate STEMI transfer networks using Medicare claims data from 2007-2021 and link\nnetworks to hospital closure and acquisition data collected and validated by the research team. We will\nleverage connections to stakeholders in STEMI systems of care and rural health as well as expertise in survey\ndesign and implementation to develop a survey of EMS agencies to collect information on the emergency\nmedical services involvement in STEMI networks. We propose the following aims: 1) estimate the association\nof STEMI network disruption with through0network time to PCI; 2) estimate the association of STEMI network\ndisruption with STEMI treatment and mortality; 3) identify network-level factors associated with changes in\npatient mortality after STEMI network disruption; and 4) quantify the role of STEMI transfer network disruption\nin rural-urban STEMI disparities. We will disseminate information on STEMI networks and their characteristics\nvia a web-based app. Our findings will identify a previously unknown access barrier for rural patients and can\ninform policymakers and clinicians about how to improve the health of rural STEMI patients.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe broad goal of the proposed work is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a specialized computer-\ndelivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to supplement standard alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment in\npatients with a co-occurring anxiety disorder (\u201ccomorbidity\u201d). Comorbidity is both common in AUD treatment\npatients (up to 50%) and confers a substantial increase in the risk of a return to drinking in the months\nfollowing treatment. Because research shows that simply adding a standard psychiatric treatment does not\nsubstantially improve the AUD outcomes of comorbid individuals, we developed a CBT-based intervention\naimed at disrupting the positive-feedback loop (\u201cvicious cycle\u201d; VC) of mutually aggravating negative affect and\ndrinking behavior/urges (the \u201cVC-CBT\u201d). In an RCT, AUD treatment patients who received the therapist-\ndelivered VC-CBT demonstrated significantly improved alcohol use outcomes as compared to those who\nreceived a standard anxiety treatment. Unfortunately, most community-based AUD treatment programs do not\nhave clinical staff with the specialized training and technical expertise needed to deliver the VC-CBT. To help\nbridge this \u201cresearch-to-practice\u201d gap, we went on to develop a fully autonomous and interactive computer-\ndelivered version of the VC-CBT and have demonstrated its functionality in AUD patients. Now, we propose to\ntest the clinical efficacy of the computer-delivered VC-CBT, as well as the mechanisms and processes by\nwhich it is hypothesized to work. Aim I is a randomized controlled trial comparing the computer-delivered VC-\nCBT to an intensity-matched computer-delivered active control intervention that focuses on healthy lifestyles.\n256 individuals in residential AUD treatment who have a comorbid anxiety disorder will receive either the VC-\nCBT or the active control intervention to obtain 200 cases that complete a 1-, 4- and 8-month follow-up. We\npredict the VC-CBT group will demonstrate superior alcohol-related outcomes at follow-up relative to the\ncontrol group. Aim II evaluates the extent to which the computer-delivered VC-CBT selectively imparts the\nskills and knowledge targeted and whether they convey (mediate) the interventions therapeutic effect. This\nentails a formal series of \u201ccausal steps\u201d analyses of the associations of: treatment\uf0e0skills/knowledge;\nskills/knowledge \uf0e0outcomes; and, treatment\uf0e0outcomes with vs. without statistically controlling the effect of\nskills/knowledge. Aim III will test the theoretically-derived prediction that the computer-delivered VC-CBT\nmoderates (i.e., weakens) the association between levels of real-time negative affect and drinking behavior/\nurge. This will be accomplished by analyzing a series of twice-daily ecological momentary assessments\n(EMAs) that participants record in their natural environment for the 7 days prior to each of the three follow-up\nassessments. The impact of this work would be to provide a scalable and inexpensive means of improving\nthe otherwise poor AUD treatment outcomes of comorbid AUD treatment patients. The work will also provide\nnew scientific knowledge about the mechanisms and processes of change in comorbidity treatment.",

    "abstract_text": "Scientific advances from pain research in basic models and chronic pain populations are rarely translated and\napplied to improve our clinical understanding of pain and disability among individuals with significant\nintellectual, motor, and communicative impairments associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite\nthe well document burden of chronic pain in cerebral palsy (CP), the most common cause of pediatric-onset\nlifelong motor and developmental disability, there is relatively little known about sensory function in relation to\nchronic pain. The heterogeneity in CP etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical appearance suggests new\napproaches may be warranted to identify measureable phenotypic patient characteristics predictive of\nindividual variation in chronic pain outcomes. Current pain assessment approaches used in CP are limited in\ntheir ability to subgroup CP patients in relation to sensory function that may be relevant for understanding\npathophysiological pain mechanisms. Most of the sensory testing research conducted with CP, while important\nand not in question, has relied on sensory stimuli designed to assess impaired discriminative tactile abilities\nsuch as two-point discrimination, texture and shape perception reflecting large sensory fiber afferent function.\nThere has been little work incorporating sensory testing approaches that simultaneously evaluate loss and gain\nof sensory function reflecting both large and small fiber afferent integrity. The specific purpose of this\napplication is to address the limited scientific understanding of sensory function in CP to ultimately reduce the\nburden of chronic pain. As a first step to close the gap between the well documented pain burden in CP and\nthe relatively unexplored pain mechanisms in CP we are proposing to investigate an objective standardized\n(protocol-based) measurement approach by extending the application of a modified quantitative sensory\ntesting (QST) protocol to characterize and compare sensory function in children with CP with and without\nchronic pain. Our reasoning is as follows. First, comparing sensory function between chronic pain and no\nchronic pain groups has the potential to reveal differences in underlying tactile/nociceptive sensory function\nwith high relevance for improving our understanding of chronic pain in CP and other severe IDD populations.\nSecond, applying QST to a large sample of children and adolescents with CP will provide the basis for\ninvestigating sensory function in relation to individual and clinical characteristics, and health outcomes to\nidentify novel tailoring variables that could guide pain treatment target selection (no such guidelines exist right\nnow). Third, using a protocol-based approach affords an important standardized context in which to investigate\nnociceptive and inflammatory relevant biomarkers. Finally, the logic of QST provides the basis for exploratory\nbut highly novel tests of sensory subtype constructs (gain, loss of function) informed by the chronic/neuropathic\npain research literature as a first step toward creating sensory-function based grouping of chronic pain in CP.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe proposed research aims to reduce obesity-related health disparities by promoting healthy lifestyle behav-\niors among African Americans (AAs), given the high disease burdens associated with low physical activity, in-\nsufficient sleep, and obesity. To this end, the candidate will seek to understand how social contextual factors\nimpact sleep by using qualitative interviews and an existing quantitative data sets (K99). Knowledge gained\nfrom the K99 phase will inform the adaptation and testing of an existing sleep intervention (MDACC IRB Proto-\ncol #2018-0568) (R00). During the K99 phase, the candidate will receive focused and intensive training involv-\ning workshops, courses, lectures, and directed readings from renowned experts in the fields of health dispari-\nties, sleep medicine, and obesity. Two studies will include: (Aim 1) conducting qualitative in-depth interviews to\nelucidate social contextual influences on sleep, while soliciting feedback to adapt a sleep intervention among\nobese, sedentary, and short-sleeping AA adults; and (Aim 2) empirically testing the associations between so-\ncial contextual factors, sleep, physical activity, and body weight using data from an ongoing studies of AAs\n(Project FAITH; American Cancer Society, RSG-17-158-01; PI: Dr. McNeill, mentor). Lastly, during the R00\nphase will compile the knowledge gained in the K99 phase to adapt a sleep intervention and test its feasibility,\nsatisfaction, and preliminary efficacy in improving sleep, increasing physical activity, and decreasing sedentary\nbehavior among overweight/obese, sedentary, and sleep-deprived AA adults (Aim 3). The candidate is\nuniquely positioned to complete the proposed research based on his past clinical experience in treating insom-\nnia and his research on sleep and obesity among AAs. The sleep intervention is a promising and innovative\napproach to optimizing psychological and physical wellness to reduce obesity and cancer-related health dis-\nparities \u2013 a research priority at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. Furthermore,\nthe proposed training plan will be critical in expediting the candidate\u2019s transition to an independent investigator\nwith focused expertise in developing culturally informed interventions to reduce cancer health disparities\namong AAs.",

    "abstract_text": "Sepsis remains a major cause of death worldwide (11 million sepsis-related deaths were reported in 2017),\nand that costs associated with treating septic patients place a large burden on the healthcare industry. Sepsis\nis a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Early stages of\nsepsis are marked by hyperinflammation driven by proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN\u03b3, and TNF).\nPatients who survive the acute phase of sepsis display long-term impairments in immune function. This state of\nchronic immunoparalysis renders sepsis survivors increasingly susceptible to secondary infections.\nConsequently, there is a desperate need to better understand the cellular and molecular basis of acute sepsis\npathophysiology and subsequent immune reprogramming that defines the prolonged immune suppression.\nCD4 T cells, essential for coordinating the cellular and humoral immune response to a range of pathogens\nunder normal circumstances, are severely depleted during the acute stage of sepsis. The overall number of\nCD4 T cells gradually recover over time, but their functional capacity remains blunted for many months. For the\npast 10 years, we have focused our research to pursue the long-term goal of understanding how sepsis\nimpacts the CD4 T cell compartment because of the key role played by CD4 T cells in the overall fitness of the\nimmune system. We will continue our investigation of the cellular and molecular reprogramming of CD4 T cells\nduring sepsis in three interconnected areas of future research: 1) Define the mechanism(s) by which regulatory\nCD4 T (Treg) cells expand during sepsis; 2) Perform an integrated discovery approach using genomics,\nproteomics, and metabolomics to elucidate the molecular basis of sepsis pathophysiology and CD4 T cell\nimmunoparalysis; and 3) Determine how intestinal microbiota dysfunction during sepsis affects the magnitude\nof the cytokine storm and promotes CD4 T cell immunoparalysis and increased incidence of late-onset\nmortality. We will interrogate samples obtained from multiple cohorts of sepsis patients, as well as from\npreclinical mouse models of sepsis at the level of Ag-specific CD4 T cell populations. Our preclinical studies\nwill be further strengthened by using a novel mouse model that mimics a critical aspect of human biology \u2013\nexposure to multiple ongoing and resolved infections trains the immune system for robust responses to new\npathogens \u2013 and will serve as an important and novel \u2018transitional translational\u2019 preclinical bridge between\nhumans and SPF laboratory mice to mechanistically study CD4 T cell dysfunction and reprogramming during\nsepsis. Addressing these key gaps in knowledge regarding the effect of sepsis on CD4 T cell biology will likely\nreveal new points of intervention that can be exploited in the future to restore CD4 T cell-mediated immunity,\nand overall immune fitness, following sepsis.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nMethamphetamine (meth) is an addictive psychostimulant. Our pilot studies show that chronic meth resulted in\ndegeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) and locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine\n(NE) but not ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA or dorsal raphe (DR) serotonin (5-HT) neurons in mice. DA, NE,\nand 5-HT are monoamine neurotransmitters synthesized and packaged into vesicles in axonal compartments.\nMeth increases cytosolic monoamines and MAO-dependent mitochondrial stress in SNc axons but not the soma.\nPilot studies show that MAO inhibition prevented meth-induced SNc degeneration. These data suggest that\ndegeneration is driven by MAO-dependent axonal mitochondrial stress. However, pilot data show meth also\nincreased LC, VTA, and DR axonal mitochondrial stress yet chronic meth induced SNc and LC but not VTA or\nDR degeneration. We found L-type Ca2+ channel (LCC)-dependent mitochondrial stress in SNc but not VTA\naxons. We propose a `two-hit' hypothesis wherein both MAO- and LCC-dependent axonal mitochondrial stress\nare required for degeneration. The degeneration `trigger' is meth-induced MAO-dependent axonal mitochondrial\nstress and vulnerability is a consequence of axonal LCC-dependent mitochondrial stress. Since MAO- and LCC-\ndependent stress converge in axons, we propose that axonal loss precedes somatic loss in a `dying-back' pattern\nof degeneration. Pilot data indicate that SNc axonal mitochondrial stress was increased during abstinence. We\nhypothesize this stress is MAO-dependent and contributes to degeneration during abstinence. Lastly, meth-\ninduced degeneration is expected to impair novel object recognition and fear conditioning which are dependent\non DA and NE, respectively. Hypotheses will be tested using two-photon laser scanning microscopy in brain\nslices, genetically encoded biosensors, pharmacological and genetic manipulation of MAO/LCCs, and\nimmunohistochemistry. Aim 1: Determine mechanisms of mitochondrial stress in monoaminergic axons,\nconsequences of chronic meth on mitochondria, and whether mitochondrial stress continues during\nabstinence. We hypothesize that SNc, VTA, LC, and DR axons all have meth-induced MAO-dependent\nmitochondrial stress whereas SNc and LC but not VTA or DR axons will have LCC-induced mitochondrial stress.\nWe also hypothesize that axonal stress will remain elevated throughout abstinence from chronic meth and will\nbe MAO-dependent. Aim 2: Determine the roles of MAO and LCCs in chronic meth-induced degeneration\nand behavioral consequences. We hypothesize that pharmacologically inhibiting or genetically deleting MAO\nor LCCs will prevent chronic meth-induced degeneration of vulnerable (SNc and LC) neurons and deleting the\nCa2+ buffering protein calbindin from resistant (VTA and DR) neurons will render them vulnerable to\ndegeneration. We further hypothesize that degeneration will be progressive throughout abstinence and MAO-\ndependent. Lastly, we hypothesize that SNc and LC degeneration will result in cognitive impairments.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nProtein prenylation is characterized by the addition of farnesyl (C15) or geranylgeranyl (C20) isoprenoids to\ncysteine residues located near the C-termini of different proteins. Although originally considered to be a rare\nmodification, it is now clear that protein prenylation is widespread in eucaryotes and is of critical importance for\na variety of proteins involved in oncogenesis, secretion, nuclear structure, and signal transduction. It has been\nestimated that as many as 2% of all proteins in mammalian cells are isoprenylated. This prevalence, coupled\nwith the central role that many of these modified proteins play in cellular signaling, underscores the\nsignificance of this post-translational modification. Prenylation inhibitors were initially developed as therapeutic\nagents for cancer treatment. With the development of precision medicine approaches that target specific Ras-\ndriven cancers, several clinical trials are ongoing. These inhibitors are also being investigated for the treatment\nof a wide variety of other disease including malaria, viral infections, Parkinson's disease and progeria.\nTwo closely linked critical questions in the field of prenylation research concern what proteins are prenylated\nand how do they change in disease? What are clearly necessary are global methods that can compare the\nprenylomes in normal and disease states and allow those prenylated proteins whose levels change to be\nidentified. If this were possible, it would reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention in these debilitating\ndiseases. To address this, new isoprenoid probes for improved metabolic labeling will be synthesized and\nmethods to decrease sample complexity and improve probe delivery will be developed. These will be utilized in\nquantitative proteomic experiments in cell culture and mouse models for disease. Another critical set of\nquestions is what controls prenylation efficiency and is how is prenylation regulated? To address these\nquestions, what are needed are strategies that allow the process of protein prenylation to be assayed in real\ntime in live cells. This would allow prenylation reactions to be studied in a holistic manner in the presence of all\nrelevant cellular components. It could open also up additional avenues for therapeutic intervention since it\ncould reveal new regulatory interactions that could be targeted. To accomplish this, cell penetrating peptides\nwith caged cysteine residues that mask their site of prenylation will be prepared and their subsequent\nprenylation monitored via microscopy after uncaging in a temporally controlled manner. Complementary\nexperiments with full-length proteins, prepared by sortase ligation, containing the same light activated trigger\nwill be used to explore potential interactions with chaperone proteins that may not be observed with the simpler\npeptide-based models.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT ABSTRACT\n The number of women incarcerated in the United States has increased more than 600% over the past\nthree decades. At last count, more than 225,000 women \u2013 a majority of whom were of reproductive age \u2013 were\nbehind bars. As the number of incarcerated women has risen, so too has the need for prisons to address\nwomen\u2019s health needs, including pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care. Providing incarcerated pregnant\nwomen with enhanced pregnancy and postpartum supports may improve both maternal and neonatal\noutcomes. One promising approach is to use doulas to provide this comprehensive support. As non-medical\ncompanions, doulas provide an array of supports and have been shown to reduce labor length and obstetric\ncomplications, improve maternal satisfaction, and promote breastfeeding initiation among low-income women.\nSeveral state prisons are now partnering with local organizations to offer enhanced pregnancy and postpartum\nsupport; yet, key questions that are critical to successful program expansion remain. The overall objective of\nthis project is to conduct a multi-state study of enhanced pregnancy and postpartum support programs for\nwomen incarcerated in six geographically-diverse prisons, with the overall goal to provide valuable, practical,\nand actionable information to prisons about how to implement pregnancy and postpartum support programs to\npromote maternal and neonatal health. We will accomplish this goal by pursuing the three specific aims: 1)\nidentify facilitators and barriers to implementation of pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum support programs\nfor women in prison, 2) evaluate the pregnancy and birth outcomes of program participants, and 3) evaluate\nthe postpartum outcomes of program participants. Results from this study will fundamentally advance our\nunderstanding of pregnancy and postpartum support programs and the maternal and neonatal outcomes\namong program participants. Identifying key modifiable factors across prisons that facilitate program\nimplementation and sustainability and documenting the outcomes of participants across sites will directly\ninform ongoing program expansion. Ultimately, this work will yield critical information to address the complex\nhealth needs of pregnant women in prison, reduce health disparities, and promote health equity among justice-\ninvolved women and their infants.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Our long-term goal is to develop new chemical probes to dissect the molecular mechanisms associated with\nepigenetic-complexes and transcriptional regulation. Establishing detailed mechanisms for the dynamic\nregulation of gene expression remains a significant challenge for the field of epigenetics. Our research\nprogram is addressing these challenges by developing selective chemical probes, discovery of new protein-\nprotein interactions, and improving structural biology and biophysical approaches to quantify these dynamic\nmultivalent interactions. These approaches are helping to create a detailed picture of diverse molecular\nassemblies of epigenetic complexes and facilitating development of new epigenetic therapies.\n Bromodomain-containing proteins are a subset of epigenetic reader protein, and are an emerging protein-\ndrug class for epigenome therapy. My research program is developing chemical biology approaches to study\ntwo specific bromodomain-containing proteins, BPTF and BRD4. One innovation behind our approach uses a\n19F NMR protein-based methodology for the discovery of isoform selective bromodomain inhibitors. Due to the\nhyper-responsive nature of fluorine to ligand binding and simplified spectra, this structural biology tool is ideally\nsuited to rapidly screen small molecules, characterize the transient interactions associated with native\ntranscription factor-protein interactions, and to quantify the dynamics of the interactions from micro to\nmillisecond timescales. Over the next five years, we will further develop this approach for enabling small\nmolecule discovery, characterizing large (> 50 kDa) proteins, and quantifying the affinity and dynamics of\nmultidomain proteins associated with synthetic nucleosomes. With their discovery enabled by 19F NMR, our\nnew chemical probes for BPTF reader domains have potential for high impact as chemical tools for inhibiting\ncancer progression and regulating autophagy, while more specific BRD4 chemical probes will help uncover\nnew biology in cancer and inflammation obscured by less specific tool compounds. We will use these tools to\ndissect the functional roles of these bromodomains on transcription, including gene regulation, chromatin\nengagement, and novel-protein-protein interactions. Next generation chemical probes will be further\ndeveloped including bifunctional molecules as inhibitors of multi-domain proteins, PROTACs with improved\nselectivity profiles, and synthetic transcription factors through conjugation to DNA-targeting polyamides.\n This proposal has broad biomedical significance for early lead discovery and studies of epigenetic reader\ndomains important in human health and disease. Given that epigenetic proteins represent a major class of\npotential drug targets, our new 19F NMR small molecule discovery method and cell-based approaches for\nepigenetic reader domains described here could significantly increase the repertoire of targets and thereby\nopen up new avenues for drug discovery.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nPyrazinamide (PZA) is a critical component of first-line tuberculosis (TB) therapy because it has dramatically\nreduced relapse rates and treatment duration. PZA is weakly active in vitro, but potently sterilizing in vivo, due\nto its outstanding activity against slow and non-replicating populations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that are\nphenotypically tolerant to most other TB drugs. Understanding the basis for the in vivo sterilizing activity of PZA\nrepresents one of the most important unmet needs in TB drug discovery. While the mode of action of PZA\nremains under investigation, our knowledge of factors that govern susceptibility and resistance has advanced\nconsiderably in recent years. PZA is a pro-drug that must be converted to the active form of pyrazinoic acid\n(POA) by the M. tuberculosis amidase PncA, and loss-of-function mutations in pncA account for at least 70%\nof clinical resistance. Other genetic variations associated with resistance have been described, but most have\nnot been evaluated in isogenic strains to determine their role in resistance, and have not been assessed for\nassociation with PZA resistance in animal models of infection. Importantly, PZA lacks antitubercular activity in\nathymic nude mice, indicating a key role for T cell-mediated immunity in efficacy. Consistent with these\nobservations, our lab and others have shown that PZA is inactive against M. tuberculosis in resting\nmacrophages, but contributes to bacterial killing in macrophages activated by interferon-gamma (IFN-\u0263). Host-\ndependent stressors that are associated with IFN-\u0263 stimulation, such as exposure to low pH, nutrient limitation\nand reactive oxygen species, have been implicated as contributors to PZA action. Our recent studies have\nrevealed a central role for specific M. tuberculosis stress responses in PZA conditional susceptibility. Through\nthese studies, we have identified a network of functions that modulates PZA susceptibility when expression of\nthe corresponding genes is altered. We have also identified specific host factors that contribute to PZA action\nin macrophages and in infected mice. Based on these findings, we have identified means to bolster drug action\nunder conditions where PZA typically lacks activity. Through this proposal, we aim to characterize novel\nmolecular mechanisms for PZA resistance, determine host factors that modulate PZA susceptibility, and\nassess opportunities in host- and microbe-targeted PZA potentiation. These studies will advance our\nunderstanding of mechanisms that govern PZA susceptibility and resistance of M. tuberculosis. As a\nsubstantial proportion of TB disease results from impaired T cell responses, it is of fundamental importance to\nunderstand how these responses relate to PZA efficacy and how we can use this information to optimize PZA\naction in the context of impaired immunity.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nNatural killer (NK) cells are potent, effector lymphocytes with the ability to kill malignant and virally infected\ncells by releasing lytic granules without the need for antigen specificity. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and\nmultiple myeloma (MM) are highly susceptible to NK cell-mediated killing. Strategies using donor NK cells to\ntreat these malignancies have yielded clinical responses in more than a third of patients, even allowing some\nrefractory AML patients to eventually get a curative bone marrow transplant. Despite these successes, NK cell\ntherapy has been limited by the short life span of infused cells and the occurrence of functional exhaustion that\noccurs when NK cells are exposed to the tumor microenvironment. A subset of NK cells, termed \u2018adaptive\u2019\ndevelops in response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Adaptive NK cells live longer than conventional NK\ncells, have a robust capacity to secrete cytokines, and are resistant to suppression in the tumor\nmicroenvironment. We demonstrated that adaptive NK cell expansion after transplant is associated with a 26%\nreduction in AML relapse and a 53% reduction in MM relapse. Our lab has developed a reliable method to\nexpand adaptive NK cells from peripheral blood of CMV seropositive donors; however, our preliminary data\nalso shows that chronic stimulation of adaptive NK cells through the activating receptor NKG2C, in combination\nwith inflammatory cytokines, induces high expression of checkpoint inhibitory receptors. We seek to\ncharacterize the in vivo behavior of adaptive NK cells given as therapy for AML or MM. In Aim 1, we will\ndetermine whether adaptive NK cells survive longer than conventional NK cells and traffic to the bone marrow\nafter allogeneic infusion. Patient samples will be collected from an ongoing phase I/II clinical trial using\nallogeneic, adaptive NK cells to treat relapsed AML. In addition, we will test adaptive NK cell persistence and\nlongevity compared to conventional NK cell therapy in a murine model of MM. In Aim 2, we will identify\nmechanisms of NK cell exhaustion and test whether checkpoint receptor blockade restores NK cell function.\nThese studies will be led by Dr. Aimee Merino, at the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, under\nthe mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Miller. Dr. Merino is currently a postdoctoral fellow, but will become an instructor\nupon completion of her fellowship training. Dr. Miller is a leader in NK cellular therapy with a track record of\ntranslating discoveries in NK cell biology into novel clinical applications. The University of Minnesota Masonic\nCancer Center offers an exceptional environment for cultivating a career in translational cancer research. To\nachieve the long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator, Dr. Merino has recruited an advisory\ncommittee of leading scientists and developed a training plan aimed at broadening her knowledge base,\ndeveloping her technical expertise, and cultivating her leadership skills.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nWith medical progress and growing efforts to empower individuals in making life-impacting choices, older\nindividuals are thus more engaged in their behavioral and socioeconomic choices than ever before. These\ndecisions are multifaceted and nuanced, but unfortunately, older adults often make poor socioeconomic\ndecisions. Progress in medicine has not only led to increased life expectancy but it has also contributed to a rise\nin Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, due to rapid increase in population aging and\nthe current absence of AD-modifying therapies. Exploiting recent advances in judgement and decision-making\nneuroscience, we now propose a three-pronged effort designed to uncover whether and how A\u03b2-dependent\nmechanisms induce changes in circuits underlying various forms of decision-making and we have formed an\ninvestigative multi-PI team uniquely qualified to pursue these questions. Leveraging exciting new results from\nour joint group, we will test the central hypothesis that decision-making in AD mice is altered in a multifaceted\neconomic- and sex-specific manner. In the light of novel findings reported in the preliminary results, we will i) test\nthe hypothesis that aging impairs decision-making differentially in male and female mice, ii) test the prediction\nthat decision-making is impaired in mouse models of AD and worsens with aging and iii) test the hypothesis that\ngenetic, pharmaceutical and optogenetic intervention will improve decision-making in AD mouse models, thereby\nproviding a preclinical proof-of-principle that decline in decision-making can be ameliorated.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nBacteria must sense and respond to rapidly changing and often stressful environments. Their ability to enact\nrapid changes in gene expression that alter cell structure and function is key to their survival. In the last twenty\nyears, it has become abundantly clear that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in bacteria is\npervasive and represents an important stress response strategy. Small RNAs (sRNAs) that base pair with\nmRNAs and regulate transcription elongation, translation, and mRNA stability are now known to be common\nmediators of bacterial post-transcriptional regulation. Small RNAs (sRNAs) number from tens to hundreds in\nbacterial genomes and carry out diverse regulatory mechanisms, yet the molecular details of their activities and\ntheir specific roles in bacterial physiology and virulence remain poorly understood. My research group has been\nengaged in research to address these questions for the last 15 years. Our overall approach is to combine\ngenomic approaches with classical genetics and biochemistry to study sRNAs from the molecular to the\nphysiological level in Escherichia coli and Salmonella model systems. Our work has defined the target regulons\nof several sRNAs, revealing a number of new molecular mechanisms of sRNA-mediated regulation. We have\nuncovered factors that promote hierarchical regulation of multi-target sRNA regulons. We have also found stress\nresponse and metabolic phenotypes for sRNA mutants, linking the molecular mechanisms of regulation to\nphysiological outcomes. In the next funding period, we will build on a strong and productive foundation of\nprevious work to continue investigating novel mechanisms of sRNA-dependent regulation in E. coli and\nSalmonella. We will extend our work to investigate the prevalence of these regulatory mechanisms and identify\nnew examples. A strong team of collaborators using a diverse set of techniques will allow us to interrogate sRNA\ninteractions with target mRNAs on a global scale and at the level of single RNA molecules. This will allow us to\ngenerate quantitative models for in vivo regulation by sRNAs and elucidate an extensive sRNA regulatory\nnetwork to produce an sRNA interaction map of greater precision than ever before. We envision continuing to\nuse studies of sRNAs to connect molecular biology to cell physiology to reveal fundamental new insight into the\nbiology of microbes.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe respiratory control system displays a remarkable capacity for neuroplasticity, imparting flexibility of breathing\nin response to changing physiological or environmental conditions across the lifespan. Gonadal hormones\n(estrogens, progestins, androgens) exert powerful modulatory effects and directly influence the development of\nneuroplasticity in other neural control areas. Yet, the role of gonadal hormone signaling in the development\nrespiratory neuroplasticity has not been clearly defined. The overarching hypothesis guiding this proposal is that\ngonadal hormone signaling within the spinal cord is necessary to enable expression of respiratory\nneuroplasticity through regulation of spinal microglia. Five important preliminary findings support this\nhypothesis. First, while estrogens and progestins are typically associated as the principal gonadal hormones in\nfemales, whereas androgens are considered the primary gonadal hormone in males, it is in fact estradiol in both\nsexes that is required to permit respiratory neuroplasticity. Second, testosterone is aromatized to estradiol\ndirectly within the spinal cord to elicit plasticity in males. Third, the estrogen receptor isoforms (ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2 and\nGPER) essential for enabling respiratory plasticity are unique in females and males. Fourth, estradiol\nsupplementation or the pharmacological activation of spinal estrogen receptors is sufficient to rescue plasticity\nfollowing removal of the gonads in both sexes. Fifth, treating the spinal cord with a localized anti-inflammatory,\nor reducing the population of CNS microglia (using a CSF1R inhibitor), is sufficient to restore respiratory\nneuroplasticity in rats of both sexes following removal of the gonads, indicating a role for spinal microglia in the\nestrogen-induced recovery of plasticity. Using rigorous neurophysiologic measures of respiratory neuroplasticity\nin combination with estrogen receptor pharmacology, targeted gene manipulation by siRNA knockdown, flow\ncytometry, mass spectroscopy, and protein biochemistry, we will dissect the role of spinal estrogen receptor\nsignaling for expression of respiratory neuroplasticity. Three specific hypotheses will be tested: 1) Spinal ER\nsignaling is necessary for induction of respiratory neuroplasticity in female and male rats; 2) Spinal estrogen\nsignaling is sufficient to restore respiratory plasticity when sex steroid levels are systemically reduced; and 3)\nEstrogen permits respiratory plasticity through modulation of spinal cord microglia. These studies address a\ncritical gap in our basic biological understanding of respiratory neural function; how sex hormone signaling\nenables development of respiratory neuroplasticity. In addition, our results will directly inform ongoing\ntranslational studies targeting mechanisms of respiratory neuroplasticity for therapeutic benefit.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nPostpartum smoking relapse rates have remained stagnant for over a decade with more than 50% of those\nwho are able to achieve smoking abstinence during pregnancy relapsing within the first few months after\nchildbirth. Maternal cigarette smoking results in significant increases in a variety of negative health\nconsequences for both mother and child. Second-hand smoke exposure to newborns and infants increases\ntheir risk of both acute and chronic illness. Therefore, research to identify safe and novel postpartum smoking\nrelapse prevention intervention is warranted. Our preliminary data indicates that the delivery of exogenous\nprogesterone (Prog) in the early postpartum period reduces several smoking relapse related risk factors (e.g.,\ncraving) and was also associated with a higher prevalence of smoking abstinence at 12-weeks postpartum.\nThese observations concur with a wealth of prior literature that demonstrates the protective effects of\nprogesterone on a variety of addictive behaviors. In our other preliminary work looking at non-pregnant\npremenopausal women, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or DMPA, which blocks ovulation for 12-weeks\nwhich subsequently decreases estradiol levels, was associated with longer previous quit attempts and reduced\nsmoking motives. These observations have shaped our central hypothesis which is that the combination of\nProg + DMPA; i.e., increased progesterone and decreased estradiol will prevent postpartum smoking relapse.\nTo examine this hypothesis, we will conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial that\nwill be implemented by an experienced, transdisciplinary, and productive team of investigators from two sites\nto enhance the diversity of the study sample and generalizability of the results. We will enroll healthy pregnant\nwomen (n=320) who have recently quit smoking and intend to stay abstinent postpartum. Using a 2\u00d72 factorial\ndesign, participants will be randomized into one of four assignments: (1) Prog + DMPA, (2) Prog + placebo, (3)\nplacebo + DMPA, and (4) placebo + placebo. Participants will be followed for days to smoking relapse (primary\noutcome), smoking relapse-related risk factors (e.g., craving), and infant health outcomes from gestational\nweek 36 through 9 months postpartum. This study proposes a safe and innovative intervention to examine the\nimpact of manipulating postpartum physiological to influence the behavior of a new mother which will lead to\nimproved health outcomes for her and her infant. The implications of this novel study will directly advance the\ncurrent state of the science by expanding on the role of Prog and DMPA in addressing smoking-related\nbehaviors within this highly vulnerable population. Further, should our central hypothesis be supported, the\nclinical translatability of this intervention is high and may be immediately pursued.",

This proposal seeks continued funding to expand, enhance, and maintain IPUMS MICS for cross-national health research. In Phase I of IPUMS MICS, we delivered over 1200 integrated variables from 218 surveys covering 90 countries and attracting almost 400 users. IPUMS MICS has already enabled ambitious research, including whether in-utero exposure to maternal fasting affects child height, via robust testing across a sample of more than 50 countries; the relationship between maternal labor supply and child disability; and how resident grandparents affect child stimulation. Phase II of IPUMS MICS will extend IPUMS MICS\u2019 substantive impact by incorporating the latest surveys, novel modules (e.g., biometric data for children aged 5-9), and new data modalities (i.e., longitudinal and time-diary data). Building on a solid foundation, we will multiply cross-country health research's spatial and temporal scope by increasing interoperability between IPUMS MICS and harmonized data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (IPUMS DHS). We plan further technological innovations to enhance data accessibility through new syntax languages, ease of complex linking, and enhanced variable discovery. We will offer guidance to researchers for conducting complex data analyses that capitalize on novel MICS features, such as research employing GPS sample points and contextual big data. We will also offer researchers free individualized support and expand our user base via webinars, workshops, conference exhibits and presentations, blog posts, and messages to the almost 300,000 IPUMS users. This work will be carried out by a team of highly-skilled researchers with extensive experience in data integration and in substantive research using global health survey data. IPUMS MICS is a cost-effective means of addressing issues central to NICHD\u2019s mission, such as scientifically valid interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes and prevent prematurity, malnutrition, childhood stunting, disease, and developmental delays. By simplifying comparative analyses based on the invaluable MICS data, IPUMS MICS enables groundbreaking research on women and children\u2019s health.",

The next phase will add\nsurvey series from new regions, while also adding the latest surveys from Africa and South Asia. Aim 2. Unlock\ncomparative research across IPUMS global health databases. IPUMS DHS will become even more powerful\nin the next phase when the database is made interoperable with other global health data series, such as\nUNICEF\u2019s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). When coupled with data from MICS, almost 90 percent of\nDHS countries will have three or more samples to compare across time, and 98 percent will have data from the\n21st century. Aim 3. Enable cutting-edge research on the impact of social and environmental context on\nhealth. The third project phase will triple the number of social and environmental context variables in IPUMS\nDHS. With these new data, researchers will conduct path-breaking research, such as global comparisons of the\nimpact of rising sea levels on the health of individuals in communities near coastlines. Aim 4. Expedite data\nanalysis by simplifying or eliminating researchers\u2019 data management tasks. Proposed enhancements will\nenable users to filter samples based on topical content, variable availability, and country characteristics. We will\nalso develop an Application Programming Interface (API), allowing users to automate the tasks of defining and\nexecuting data extracts. Aim 5. Support and expand our user community. IPUMS DHS is committed to\ndemocratizing access to population data. The project will continue to provide robust individualized user support,\nwebinars, and workshops at key conferences, while introducing online tutorials and code-sharing opportunities.",

However, to best utilize such methods, understanding the options for tissue\nclearing, and the advantages and disadvantages of various imaging methods need to be appreciated.\nFurthermore, data handling, analysis, and storage all provide significant obstacles when attempting to make full\nuse of the capabilities of these modern techniques.\nThe Structural Circuits Core (SCC) helps researchers best utilize ultramodern technology for the anatomical\nmapping of brain circuitry involved in drug addiction. In order to do so, the SCC partners with the University\nImaging Center (UIC), the University Research Informatics - Informatics and Computing (RI-InC) group, the\nMinnesota Supercomputing Institute (SCI) and the Data Repository for the University of Minnesota (DRUM). The\nSCC provides the infrastructure for automated use of brain clearing technology paired with meso- and micro-\nscale imaging of the central nervous system. Importantly, the SCC helps tailor experiments to best utilize the\nmost appropriate methodological and technological approaches, and, integrating with the Addiction Connectome\nCore, provides standardized resources for the analysis, storage, and distribution of these imaging datasets. The\nSCC not only allows investigators to quickly and thoroughly interrogate their own data, but also allows\nquantitative comparisons across laboratories through a common format structure and custom designed software.",

To meet the\nchallenge of developing new and effective treatments to help those that have succumbed to the temptation of\ndrug use and abuse, we need to inspire the next generation of students to pursue research careers in the field.\nThe need is particularly acute among populations of students who are currently underrepresented in the field of\ndrug abuse. Published analyses indicate that exposing undergraduate students, especially early in their career,\nto laboratory research is an extremely effective way for developing their interest in research as a profession.\nSince 1989, the University of Minnesota of has recognized and met this challenge by offering summer\nresidential research programs in the biomedical sciences. This proposal is the competitive renewal of a training\nprogram that specifically provides research experience in the field of drug addiction. Our goal is to train\nundergraduate students who have completed their freshman or sophomore years in college. We will recruit\nstudents nationally, accepting students from groups that are underrepresented within the biomedical research\nprofession. We will provide them with a 10-week intensive research experience that will include professional\nmentoring (academic survival skills and preparation for graduate school) as well as workshops on research\nethics. Our goal is to inspire a new generation of drug abuse researchers. In turn, we expect these individuals\nto become part of the research infrastructure dedicated to solving medical problems of nervous system\ndysfunction",

Research programs across the 26 participating investigators span cellular and molecular, systems, computational, and behavioral neuroscience-based approaches to studying addiction. The program aligns basic researchers, technology engineers, and translational scientists to provide an exceptional breadth of scientific scope and training capacity. The scientific environment is highly cooperative, with robust extramural research support that benefits from multiple active collaborations. Rigorous and effective training is supported through tailoring individual developmental plans, the addition of new courses in quantitative analyses and computational neuroscience methods, a highly comprehensive program for mentoring the mentors, thorough evaluation of training outcomes, and expanding outreach across the state of Minnesota. The commitment of the University of Minnesota to this training program is readily apparent; over 30 million dollars was recently invested in the hiring of faculty studying the neuroscience underlying drug addiction. This has resulted in the addition of numerous new exceptional mentoring faculty to the program. This proposal requests six predoctoral and three postdoctoral positions, the same number as previously supported. Robust institutional support will provide an additional three training slots, with the remaining matching funds providing resources for an annual retreat, on-going seminar series, and additional program expenditures.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMARY: Addiction Neural Dynamics Core\nAddiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder due to perturbations in neural circuits. To better understand the\nunderlying pathophysiological processes occurring in addiction and the actions of new therapies, there are\npressing needs to monitor neural activity and structure during addiction and relapse. Visualization of nervous\nsystem function and structure in the intact, behaving animal is a powerful approach to meet these needs. Recent\nadvances in genetically encoded Ca2+, voltage, and neurotransmitter indicators and imaging tools, large-scale\nhigh-density microelectrode recordings, and sophisticated neural and behavioral analyses have greatly\nexpanded the opportunities for probing the nervous system at work.\nMany labs at the University of Minnesota (UMN) lack the equipment and expertise to perform many of these\nadvanced imaging and recording techniques during behavior. Nor is it possible for most investigators to keep up\nwith the rapid changes in these tools, either in the engineering or application domains. The Addiction Neural\nDynamics Core (ANDC) is designed to allow addiction and other researchers to take advantage of these modern\ntechniques to probe brain function during behavior. Providing access to up-to-date imaging and recording\ntechniques, engineering, and manufacturing support, as well as computational tools, will reduce the time and\ncosts needed to set up experiments and process data, lower the entry barriers for both new and established\ninvestigators, and assist in developing new imaging tools and applications.\nAim 1 is to provide resources, expertise, and training in three in vivo imaging technologies used in behaving\nanimals: 1) wide FOV imaging of the cerebral cortex and cerebellar cortex during both headfixed and freely\nmoving behaviors; 2) fiber photometry to monitor the activity of genetically defined elements in neural circuits;\nand 3) engineering expertise for use of miniscopes and for realizing customized imaging devices/solutions. Each\nof these technologies is critical to understanding how neural circuits change in addiction. The ANDC will also\nprovide sophisticated hardware and software to monitor and analyze behavior.\nAim 2 strives to expand the capabilities of our existing technologies. These include: 1) begin to dissect out the\nentire addiction circuit using simultaneous multi-Neuropixel probes using our cranial-exoskeleton; 2) develop the\ncapabilities and expertise for cortex wide and deep brain miniscope imaging of neurotransmitter signaling; 3)\nimplement voltage imaging using the newest classes of genetically encoded voltage indicators. Enhancing the\nimaging and recording modalities will elevate the research problems addressed, translational perspective, and\noverall impact as well as increase the number of ANDC investigators.\nThe ANDC will provide the research infrastructure, expertise and training to allow the addiction community to\nimage and record neuronal activity and neural circuitry during behavior. Providing these tools will enhance the\nproductivity, quality, and impact of addiction-related and other neuroscience research at the UMN.",

    "abstract_text": "OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe purpose of our P50 Conte Center is to develop, test, and apply computational models of disrupted state\nrepresentation processes to behavioral and neural measures relevant to psychosis spectrum illness across\nmouse, macaque, and human experiments. Our premise is that, in order to respond adaptively to the\nenvironment, the brain must process information to develop accurate and stable representations of the current\nstate of the world; this requires neural processes that: 1) estimate the current state of the world; 2) use\nreward-based feedback to learn to recognize new states; and 3) maintain state representation across time\ngaps. State representation processes rely on precise neural activity including timing synchrony between\nprefrontal and sensory systems and across prefrontal and subcortical networks, including striatal systems. Our\noverarching hypothesis is that a range of computationally identifiable microcognitive processes contribute to\nstate representation disruptions in psychosis, that these vary dimensionally across individuals (potentially\nmanifesting as computational subprofiles), and that their underlying neural contributors, once understood,\ncould serve as targets for precision treatments. Informed by our Center\u2019s recent findings from\nNMDAR-antagonism in macaques, from NMDAR ablation and dopamine (ant)agonism in mice, and from\nEEG+fMRI studies in humans with and without psychosis, we will examine variable patterns of behavior and\nneurophysiology during task performance, examining the interplay between state estimation, state\nmaintenance, and state learning computations.\nAim 1: Computational science. Informed by biologically-grounded theoretical models and successes in the\nprevious cycle, we will continue to develop methods to measure computational parameters of state\nrepresentation processes, integrating across two tasks. Each task probes distinct neurocognitive and neural\nsystem operations\u2013 cognitive control and reward-based decision-making\u2013 highly relevant to psychosis.\nAim 2: Non-human animal experimental science. Applying these computational methods, and drawing on\nfindings from our human studies, we will analyze the behavior and neurophysiology of state representation\nprocesses relevant to psychosis, in mice and in macaques, under normal conditions and after manipulations of\nNMDAR and dopaminergic systems.\nAim 3: Clinical science. Applying these computational methods, and drawing on findings from our non-human\nanimal studies, we will identify the computational dimensions relevant to psychosis and their neural system\ncorrelates in humans (via EEG studies and innovative within-subject Precision Functional Mapping) with a\nfocus on interactions among CEN, SN, and DMN network dynamics; we will identify how computational\nsubprofiles in humans can be altered in response to manipulations of NMDAR and dopaminergic systems.",

Based on our analyses of computational parameters derived from state representation processes in\na cognitive control and a reward-based decision-making task, we have observed dimensions of computational\nvariation (subprofiles) in early psychosis that show meaningful preliminary clinical, cognitive, and\nneurophysiologic correlates. These subprofiles are characterized by various combinations of impairments in\nstate estimation, maintenance, and/or learning. Based on parallel findings in our Center\u2019s mouse and macaque\nprojects, we hypothesize that some of these subprofiles may more predominantly reflect cortical NMDAR\nhypofunction vs. striato-cortical (dopamine-glutamate) dysfunction, with differential aberrations in large-scale\nneural network dynamics across the central executive, salience, and default mode networks. We hypothesize\nthat these subprofiles may deepen our understanding of psychosis illness heterogeneity and inform\npersonalized interventions for cognition and motivation. Participants will be drawn from PROJECT 4, where\nthey will have been assessed with clinical, behavioral and EEG measures.\nIn Aim 1, we investigate computational parameter and EEG changes in healthy individuals after\npsychosis-relevant pharmacological manipulations of NMDAR and dopaminergic function. We will randomly\nassign 75 healthy volunteers to 1 of 5 single-dose conditions: NMDAR-antagonism alone (ketamine); increased\nstriatal dopamine (DA) tone alone (modafinil); both probes together; DA antagonism (risperidone) and placebo.\nWe test hypotheses that NMDAR-antagonism, increased DA, their combination, and D2 receptor blockade\neach affect state representation processes ways consistent with observations from animal models.\nIn Aim 2, we perform a within-subject study of changes in computational parameters and precision functional\nconnectomics in psychosis after pharmacologic manipulations that enhance either NMDAR or dopaminergic\nfunction. We will stratify 20 participants with early psychosis on two of our identified computational subprofiles\nthat exhibit validity with prior research, and randomly assign the order of receiving the NMDAR co-agonist\nd-serine, the stimulant modafinil, and placebo. Using highly innovative Precision Functional Mapping methods,\nwe will determine the within-subject changes after each probe, with a focus on central executive, salience, and\ndefault mode network dynamics. Our goal is to use the pharmacological manipulations as mechanistic probes\nto test for specific differential effects on microcognitive processes and network dynamics across the 2\nsubprofiles, with the goal of setting the stage for future precision psychiatry research.",

Deficits in representing and learning about states of the world underlie maladaptive cognitive\ncontrol and reward learning in psychosis, and frontostriatal-DA interactions are critical to adaptively regulating\nthese processes in service of behavioral flexibility. Despite decades of research, our understanding of the\nprecise computational and circuit-level mechanisms that contribute to the manifestations of\npsychosis\u2014particularly the role of DA activity across spatial and temporal scales \u2014remains incomplete.\nSpecifically, what spatiotemporal circuit interactions link DA dynamics in the caudate striatum to state\nestimation, state representational stability (maintenance), and learning of reward-predictive states?\nUsing our novel optical preparation for manipulating and imaging large-scale DA dynamics across the entire\nrodent dorsal striatum, we will specifically focus on how striatal hyperdopaminergia and NMDAR dysregulation\naffect parameters of tightly coordinated spatiotemporal DA patterns within and across the dorsal striatum,\nventral striatum, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Our goal is to combine circuit, behavioral, and\ncomputational approaches to link state representation disruptions seen in psychosis to computational\noperations regulated by dopaminergic modulation of frontostriatal circuits.\nAim 1: Assess how DS spatiotemporal DA coordination is affected by various models of\npsychopathology.

We will induce a temporary state of brain dysfunction in macaques that is\nrelevant to psychosis in humans by pharmacologically blocking NMDA receptors and stimulating DA receptor\nsignaling, alone and in combination. We will then trace resulting state representation disruptions back to the\ndistortions of cellular and network activity responsible for the computational errors, with the goal of\ncharacterizing the biological foundations of computational disruptions that are relevant to psychosis.\nWe will train monkeys to perform a cognitive control and a reward-based decision-making task that each\nengage different aspects of state representation. We will then fit computational models to behavioral choice\ndata to define and quantify the computations the brain performs to produce behavioral outputs. We will record\nneural activity during task performance in order to relate the model-defined computational patterns to patterns\nof electrical activity in neurons and networks. Neural recordings will focus on central executive (CEN), salience\n(SN), and default mode (DMN) network dynamics, in keeping with Center findings in people with psychosis.\nNeural activity will be measured via Neuropixel probes in multiple brain areas located within these networks\nsimultaneously, with each probe capable of recording action potentials from up to hundreds of individually\nisolated neurons.\nWe will also record neural activity within the dorsal striatum (dSTR) along with cortical areas to test the\nhypothesis that a 3-factor learning rule operates in corticostriatal networks to govern state learning over trials.\nSuch learning rules, supported by recent theoretical and neurophysiological studies, postulate that synaptic\nplasticity is controlled by the interaction between neural signals reflecting synchrony (likely to activate NMDA\nreceptors) and neural signals reflecting reinforcement (likely to activate DA receptors). We will test the\nhypothesis that impairments in state representation processes in psychosis emerge as a consequence of\ndisrupted 3-factor learning, by linking computational impairments to neurophysiological distortions that occur\ndownstream of reduced NMDA and increased DA synaptic function, both implicated as playing a pathogenic\nrole in psychosis. This will reveal how computational disruptions derive from distortions of synaptic and neural\nfunction \u2013 critically essential knowledge we need, and currently lack, in order to guide a\nmechanistically-informed search for more effective personalized treatments for psychosis.",

We will do this by examining EEG and MRI signals associated with state representation changes\nacross a broad spectrum of early psychosis patients and community controls. All participants complete the\ncognitive control task (TOPX) and reward-based decision-making task (TBT) being used across our Center that\nallow modeling of state estimation, maintenance, and learning. We will use the parameters derived from the\ncomputational models to investigate MRI and EEG indices in the central executive network (CEN), the salience\nnetwork (SN) and the default mode network (DMN), and to examine clinical symptoms and patient subprofiles\nthat derive from different patterns of disruption. Our overarching goal is to test the utility of computational\nmodeling of state representation disruptions in parsing the heterogeneity of early psychosis to align with\npathophysiological mechanisms, with the aim of informing future precision psychiatry interventions.\nIn Study 1, we continue to analyze longitudinal and simultaneously acquired fMRI/EEG in 100 early psychosis\n(EP) patients and 100 community controls. In Study 2, we add a new EP sample (n=150) with matched\ncontrols (n=150) using high-density EEG during extended versions of our two Center tasks to replicate and\nextend upon our recent findings of distinct computational subprofiles in EP individuals. In Study 3, we collect a\nlarge online sample (n=1,000) to optimize the efficiency of computational assessment across the two tasks.\nAim 1: Characterize state representation disruptions in psychosis using computational modeling of a\ncognitive control task and a reward-based decision-making task. We will model trial-level behavioral data\nto test the reliability and generalizability of state representation processes assessed via TOPX and TBT. Aim 2:\nDetermine neural functions associated with state representation disruptions in early psychosis. We will\nmap state representation parameters onto neural functions, using EEG-fMRI data acquired during the current\ncycle, and in an independent sample of EP individuals via EEG metrics measured more precisely. Our focus\nwill be on characterizing control dynamics of CEN, SN, and DMN interactions. Aim 3: Validate dimensions of\ncomputational variation in early psychosis and determine their clinical, cognitive, and\nneurophysiologic correlates. With data from all three studies, we will perform classification and information\ntheoretic analyses of state representation parameters, in order to see if we replicate the computational\nsubprofiles identified in the first funding period and in order to extend upon their relation with clinical and\nneurophysiological measures.",

During the\ninitial grant period, we found that individuals with early psychosis (EP) showed significant failures during\nexploration and state learning in salience network (SN) activation (of which the insular cortex is a critical hub),\nimplicating deficits in communication from this network in engaging appropriate strategy switching. These\nfindings highlight the potential role for activity in the insular cortex as an important influence on the mPFC, as\nwell as the ability to learn and maintain state representations. A large body of evidence indicates that NMDAR\nhypofunction in frontal cortex is a pathogenic factor in psychosis spectrum illness.\nWe will build on our substantial progress during the initial funding period, which includes establishing a\nmolecular genetic platform to manipulate NMDAR function via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in mice.\nBuilding on findings across PROJECTS from the first cycle, we hypothesize that neuronal synchrony in the\nmPFC is necessary to support state representations, and this synchrony is controlled at multiple levels:\nmolecularly within mPFC by NMDAR ablation, and at a circuit level by insular cortex inputs driving the\nengagement of mPFC. Both should be necessary to engage mPFC-mediated cognitive control to support state\nlearning and maintenance. In two Aims, we will test the relationship between neuronal activity in mPFC and\ninsular cortex inputs, and discover how this relationship is impacted by CRISPR-mediated loss of NMDAR\nfunction across mPFC neurons.\nIn Aim 1, we will determine the relationship between mPFC in vivo activity supporting state representation with\ninsular cortex activity via silicon probe recordings across regions, testing the directionality of ensemble and\nlocal field potentials from insula to mPFC, and determine whether this relationship is impaired by ablation of\nNMDAR function in mPFC neurons. In Aim 2, we will measure and modulate synaptic input from insular cortex\nafter NMDAR ablation in mPFC, using parallel optogenetic manipulations in vivo (behaving animals) and ex\nvivo (acute brain slice physiology). We will combine these approaches to test whether state representation\nprocesses and mPFC synaptic connectivity can be bidirectionally modulated by insular cortex, and whether this\nis prevented by NMDAR manipulations.",

To\ntest this hypothesis, our Center will perform two parallel translational tasks across all Projects and species: a\ncognitive control Translational Orientation Pattern EXpectancy Task (TOPX, derived from the well-studied DPX\ntask), and a reward-based Translational restless Bandit Task (TBT, derived from well-studied probabilistic\nreinforcement learning paradigms). Each task allows us to probe different aspects of state representation (state\nestimation, learning, and maintenance), facilitating the translation of experimental findings across mice,\nmacaques, and humans. This translation will be facilitated by similar analytics pipelines across Projects,\nguided by the expertise and efficiency of our central Core.

In Aim 2, we will integrate analyses of TOPX and TBT behavioral data with\ncomputational neural hypotheses. TOPX and TBT parameters will be integrated with neurophysiologic findings\nacross species, and translation will be facilitated by using connectivity data (combination of diffusion and\nresting-state fMRI) to identify homologies across nonhuman animals and humans.

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nCentral nervous system (CNS) relapse is a major cause of treatment failure among patients with acute\nlymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Notably, isolated CNS relapse occurs in ~3-8% of children with ALL and\naccounts for 30\u201340% of initial relapses in some clinical trials. Furthermore, current CNS-directed therapies are\nassociated with significant toxicities. As a result, novel CNS-directed leukemia therapies are urgently needed\nto improve long-term outcomes while decreasing treatment-related morbidity. Although extensive research has\ndemonstrated a critical role of the bone marrow microenvironment in leukemia biology, the impact of the CNS\nmicroenvironment on leukemia cell survival and chemoresistance is largely unknown. We developed a novel\nex vivo co-culture system and an in vivo xenotransplantation approach to investigate the effects of the CNS\nniche on leukemia biology and chemoresistance. We then used these model systems to identify that 1)\nleukemia cells cultured in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in vitro and in vivo have diminished survival relative to\nserum or media, 2) leukemia cells predominantly localize to the meninges within the CNS, and 3) leukemia\ncells co-cultured with meningeal cells, or associated with the meninges of mice, exhibit enhanced survival and\nchemoresistance. We then identified that direct meningeal-leukemia interactions promote leukemia cell survival\nby modulating apoptosis balance, cell cycle progression, and quiescence. Importantly, leukemia\nchemoresistance was reversible and overcome by detaching the leukemia cells from the meninges. We then\nused a co-culture adhesion assay to identify drugs that disrupt the interaction between leukemia and\nmeningeal cells. In addition to identifying several drugs that inhibit canonical cell adhesion targets and\npathways, including the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, we found that Me6TREN, a novel small-molecule\nhematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilizing compound, also disrupts the interaction between leukemia and\nmeningeal cells. This work demonstrates that the meninges exert a unique and critical influence on leukemia\nchemoresistance and defines novel mechanisms of CNS relapse beyond the well-described role of the blood-\nbrain barrier. Based on this work, our central hypothesis is that the leukemia-meningeal cell interaction is a\ncritical regulator of leukemia cell survival and chemoresistance in the CNS. Moreover, from a therapeutic\nstandpoint, we hypothesize that niche disruption may be more efficacious in the CNS than in the bone marrow\nbecause of the less supportive environment of the CSF relative to the blood or serum. The objectives in this\nproposal are to use our in vitro and in vivo model systems for CNS leukemia to dissect the molecular\nmechanisms that mediate leukemia adhesion (Aim 1) and chemoresistance (Aim 2) in the CNS and test novel,\nclinically translatable therapies for CNS leukemia including Me6TREN and AMD3100 (Aim 3).",

    "abstract_text": "Class V dental restorations, those on the lower third of the tooth, are the least durable type of dental restoration and are quickly increasing in placement due to a rapidly aging society. Water and bacteria mediated destruction of the dentin/restoration interface is the main cause of failure. Maintenance of integrity between the restorative material and surrounding tissue is an unexplored route to increase lifespans of Class V restorations to shield the vulnerable adhesive interface from bacteria-mediated degradation, promote restoration stability, and increase restoration aesthetics. Tissue attachment to current Class V restorative surfaces does not occur as current restorative materials lack any activity designed to influence tissue responses. This lack of attachment reveals the vulnerable dentin/restoration interface and exacerbates Class V failure. Functional tissues near Class V restorations may be able to naturally prevent subgingival plaque and lead to longer lifespans by exploiting the tissue. Our central goal is to develop new materials and apply experimental approaches toward reducing Class V failure.  In Aim 1, we aim to understand oral cellular activation responsible for signaling and test candidate molecules for their ability to survive enzymatic degradation. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate our system enables biocompatible, facile, rapid, and robust delivery of biofunctional molecules to the material surface and retains molecules through a series of challenges meant to simulate the oral environment. The results will potentially extend lifespans of Class V dental restorative materials and reduce longterm healthcare costs. This training grant will provide pivotal opportunities to learn techniques including flow cytometry, high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and molecular biology techniques. Improved understanding of these techniques will further my progress toward becoming an independent academic researcher at a dental school.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nAntifungal drug resistant Candida species pose an urgent antimicrobial threat worldwide. Patients with invasive\nCandida infections experience high mortality >40%, despite the use of modern antifungal therapies. Only three\ndrug classes are frequently used to treat Candida infections: azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes. Resistance\nto all three classes is increasing. The acquisition of antifungal drug resistance is frequently associated with large\ngenomic copy number changes in diverse fungal pathogens, including Candida species. We identified novel\nlarge accordion-like DNA amplifications in C. albicans that rapidly expand during adaptation to azoles in vitro,\namplifying hundreds of genes to more than 10 copies. We also reported that 50% of azole resistant C. albicans\nclinical isolates are aneuploid, and that Candida auris aneuploids can evolve during on-patient antifungal\ntherapy. Aneuploidy is also associated with antifungal tolerance, a poorly understood phenotype that enables\nCandida to grow slowly at high concentrations of all three drug classes, well above the minimum inhibitory\nconcentration. We propose that aneuploidy-mediated antifungal tolerance is promoting the evolution of antifungal\nresistance. Despite the frequency of aneuploidy, the rate and dynamics of chromosome copy number changes\nduring adaptation to antifungal drug are not known for any fungal pathogen. We developed several high\nthroughput single-cell and population-level approaches to comprehensively quantify the emergence and spread\nof all genomic changes during the acquisition of antifungal resistance, in real time. Our multidisciplinary approach\nuniquely positions us to identify new mechanisms of acquired antifungal tolerance and resistance in a rigorous\nand reproducible way. For example, we identified the sterol biosynthesis pathway as a hotspot for acquired\nmultidrug resistance and tolerance across diverse Candida species, creating a paradigm shift: Multidrug\nresistance can evolve during adaptation to a single antifungal drug class, due to acquisition of a single point\nmutation. The aims of this proposal take a new approach to identifying the mechanisms driving antifungal drug\nresistance: We will use a new single-cell flow cytometry assay to quantify the rate and dynamics of aneuploid\nevents during adaptation to each drug class and determine the effect of drug class on the evolution of drug\nresistance (Aim 1). We will comprehensively identify genes that when amplified alter drug susceptibility in vitro\nand in vivo using a novel CRISPR-amplification approach (Aim 2). Finally, we will use comprehensive molecular\napproaches to determine the degree to which mutations in the sterol biosynthesis pathway cause multidrug\nresistance in diverse Candida species (Aim 3). This comparative analysis of acquired resistance will provide a\nstrong foundation for work in other Candida species. Together the outcomes from these experiments will identify\nthe mechanisms that underlie how Candida species acquire drug tolerance and resistance and can pave the\nway for developing therapeutics to reduce the significant mortality caused by diverse antifungal drug resistant\nCandida species.",

The current paradigm of chemical (antibiotics) control\nis eroding with the escalating challenge from resistance, and new strategies are needed. Quorum\nsensing (QS), a communication system utilized by bacteria and based on signaling molecules is\nappealing because it controls several bacterial behaviors. However, our current understanding of QS\nand our ability to manipulate is rudimentary.\n Here we propose to comprehensively investigate QS using interference strategies, specifically\nenzymes such as lactonases that can degrade the signaling molecules N-acyl-homoserine lactones, to\ndecode the microbial language. Our group demonstrated the efficacy of interference in QS using these\nenzymes across various contexts, including monocultures and complex communities. Yet, challenges\nremain in achieving the selectivity needed to specifically isolate the contribution of individual signals\nand infer their biological roles. We propose to address critical gaps in QS interference by elucidating\nits effects on bacterial behavior and interspecies competition. Additionally, we will continue to unravel\nthe molecular determinants governing lactonase mechanisms and substrate selectivity. Lastly, we will\ncharacterize and enhance enzymes capable of degrading orthogonal signals, such as autoinducing\npeptides (AIPs) to considerably expanding the scope of QS manipulation.\n The expected impact from this proposal extends beyond the fundamental insights into bacterial\ncommunication. By unveiling novel regulatory mechanisms and advancing our enzymatic\nunderstanding, this work will enable the design of highly specific quorum quenchers. Ultimately, these\nfindings will inform bacterial control strategies with implications for human health and beyond.",

Many of these bioactive peptides harbor\nbackbone \u03b1-N-methylations and/or macrocyclizations, since these tailorings significantly improve peptide\npharmacokinetics. As seen in the blockbuster immunosuppressant cyclosporin A, \u03b1-N-methylated peptides have\nincreased structural rigidity, proteolytic resistance, and membrane permeability. Despite these advantages,\ninefficient synthetic and in vitro processes hinder the production, screening, and optimization of \u03b1-N-methylated\npeptides. In addition, natural sources of amide backbone-methylated peptides were thought to be completely\nlimited to inflexible nonribosomal peptide biosynthetic pathways. The goal of this work is to identify new \u03b1-N-\nmethylated metabolites and tease out the mechanistic and structural constraints of biocatalysts from our newly\ndiscovered ribosomally encoded peptide natural product family named the borosins. Our first objective aims to\nuncover rules of iterative catalysis, inhibition, and cooperativity in our model borosin system. Our second\nobjective targets the discovery and study of structurally complex borosin metabolites from cystic fibrosis\npathogens. Our last objective focuses on the mechanism and structure of \u03b1-N-methylation\u2013dependent proteases\nand macrocyclases.

    "abstract_text": "Title: Control of Chromosome Segregation by DNA Topoisomerase II.\nAbstract\nChromosome segregation errors result in aneuploidy, which causes birth defects and cancer. We have\ndefined a new mitotic Topo II-responsive control (TRC) that delays the cell cycle when Topo II activity is\ninsufficient for accurate chromosome segregation. This TRC mechanism is conserved from yeast to human\ncells but has not been extensively studied. Activation of the TRC is triggered by stalling of the strand\npassage reaction of Topo II, when the enzyme becomes trapped on DNA in the Closed Clamp structural\nconformation. TRC activation requires two distinct modules within the catalytically inert C-terminal domain of\nTopoII: (i) A cluster of SUMOylation sites, and (ii) The Chromatin Tether domain of Topo II, which interacts\nwith methylated nucleosomes. The central molecular model is that stalled strand passage leads to C-terminal\ndomain SUMOylation that functions as a signal-generating scaffold to halt the cell cycle. The conservation\nbetween the human and yeast TRC responses provided unique opportunities to identify TRC components,\nbut gaps remain in our understanding of the mechanism of TRC activation. We aim to determine how the\nTRC activates Mad2 to inhibit anaphase initiation, which will require determining the identity of the E3 ligase\nthat SUMOylates TopoII as well as the relevant substrates of Aurora B kinase. We will determine how\ntrapped Closed Clamps trigger TopoII SUMOylation and how they are repaired. The role of the ChT domain\nwill be determined and whether interaction with nucleosomes is required for TRC activation. The results of\nthese studies will impact opportunities for translational research because we will identify new potential\ntherapeutic targets. Our findings will also impact the use of widely prescribed therapeutic drugs that target\nTopo II because we will gain mechanistic insight into cellular responses to Topo II inhibition. The preliminary\ndata and newly developed experimental tools place us in a unique position to determine the conserved\nmechanism of this scarcely studied mitotic control.",

We propose a new method for evaluating the RF safety of custom-built coils\nusing an automated EM field measurement system. The proposed approach will allow safety evaluation with low\npower settings in a comprehensive manner.\nSupra-linear gains are expected with increasing field strength, however achieving these SNR gains in real life is\na challenging engineering problem. Design and implementation of new RF coil technologies are essential for this\ngoal. We will focus on developing novel RF coil designs that combine different coil geometries (e.g. loops and\nnon-uniform dielectric substrate dipoles or sleeve antennas). We will also utilize novel RF electronics concepts\nincluding miniaturized integrated circuit low noise amplifiers and coil clusters to improve coil performance. To\nenhance SNR we will explore new receiver concepts and will investigate the possibility of harvesting the sheath\ncurrents flowing on receive coaxial cable circuity to further improve SNR. Combining these approaches, we will\naim to capture the physically achievable limits of SNR in UHF MRI. We will translate the extensive prior\nexperience we have developing human brain and body as well as awake and anesthetize NHP array technology\nat 10.5T along with the more recent insights to optimally capture central and peripheral SNR towards the design\nof optimized multi-channel transceiver/receiver arrays for 16.4T/700 MHz studies of marmosets. Particularly\npromising and impactful here is the integration of field orientation insensitive miniature IC preamplifiers of sub-\ncm scale which allow for on-coil amplification without line-of-sight restrictions.

Current CIs provide crucial speech information to many recipients, but do not restore normal hearing, and\nare particularly challenged in noisy or complex acoustic environments. Despite concerted efforts over the past\n25 years, little overall improvement in CI performance has been obtained, primarily due to the poor electrode-\nneural interface in which the CI electrodes are immersed in cochlear fluids and separated from the auditory\nnerve by the cochlea's bony wall. The new approach will build upon encouraging data from animal studies,\nwell-established human surgical techniques to access the auditory nerve, and high-density electrode and safe\nstimulation technologies currently available for human use in order to test the safety and efficacy of the ANI\nthat enables direct contact between the electrodes and the auditory nerve. The ANI provides great promise of\nimproved speech and music perception for its prospective recipients, by overcoming the challenge that has\nlimited improvements in CIs for the past quarter century. The first aim is to design and build a full ANI system\nin accordance with regulatory requirements, including necessary reliability, safety, functional, biocompatibility,\nand sterilization testing for human use. The ANI system will be built by combining a well-established CI device\nin the auditory implant field with a novel electrode and cabling technology already being evaluated in human\npatients for other clinical applications. The second aim is to refine the ANI surgery in human cadaver\nexperiments and acutely during other relevant in vivo operations to consistently position and anchor the\nelectrode array and cabling into the target region. The third aim is to develop and validate critical\npsychophysical tests to properly evaluate the performance of the ANI during the pilot human study, which can\nthen inform the design of a future clinical ANI device. The fourth aim is to seek regulatory approvals and set up\nthe clinical trial infrastructure and monitoring entities. The fifth and final aim is to perform a pilot ANI study in up\nto three deaf patients to obtain safety, reliability and functionality data that can properly guide the design of a\nproceeding clinical device and a feasibility study.",

We couple NMR\nspectroscopy with other powerful biophysical techniques to probe structure and dynamics and then employ\nbiochemical and in vivo activity assays to better understand function.

Currently, our primary focus is the MRE11-RAD50-\nNBS1/Xrs2 (MRN/X) protein complex, which plays a central role in the DNA double strand break (DSB)\nrepair response. The MRN/X complex is essential for detecting and repairing DNA DSB breaks, as well as\nfor signaling their presence to the rest of the DNA DSB response. Additionally, the MRN/X complex has\nroles in DNA replication and telomere maintenance.

ID impairs cognition in children, causes persistent cognitive impairments and\nincreases risk of neuropsychiatric disorders despite postnatal iron treatment. The long-term effects of early-life\nID are the real cost to society because of lost education and job potential and their association with\ntransgenerational racial health disparities. In mice, hippocampal neuron-specific ID causes long-term\nlearning/memory neurocircuit dysfunction despite postnatal iron repletion, demonstrating the long-term effects\nare due to neuronal iron loss during development. Thus, dysregulation of early-life neuronal iron-requiring\nactivities set neuronal functional capacity across the lifespan.\n The fetal/neonatal brain is highly metabolic, accounting for 60% of total body oxygen consumption. The\nhippocampus has one of the highest regional metabolic rates in the neonatal brain. Iron provides the catalytic\ncomponent for enzymes required for mitochondrial electron transport and energy production. Mitochondrial\nquality control mechanisms (e.g., redox balance, fusion/fission, and mitophagy) maintain mitochondrial structure\nand energetic homeostasis and prevent long-term mitochondrial damage and dysfunction. Early-life ID acutely\ndisrupts these processes, impairing dendrite and synapse formation. Postnatal iron repletion does not rescue\nID-induced mitochondrial energetic impairments in the adult brain, suggesting a permanent reprogramming.\n The cellular mechanisms of how developmental ID causes long-term neuronal structural and functional\ndeficits and whether these can be prevented with iron treatment alone are unclear. We will test the overall\nhypothesis that permanently impaired hippocampal mitochondrial energetic capacity and quality control is\nprogrammed during early life, directly contributes to the compromised neurocircuitry that persists after recovery\nfrom early-life ID and that prenatal maternal iron repletion is required to prevent this. In Aim 1, we will utilize a\nunique in vitro model of chronic fetal-neonatal hippocampal neuronal ID to test the timing and dose of\niron repletion during development in order to prevent programming of long-term mitochondrial neuronal\nstructural deficits. We will treat iron-deficient hippocampal neuron cultures with moderate or high dose iron at\nneuron developmental stages equivalent to human 2nd trimester, birth, and 6-12 months. Recovery of\nmitochondrial quality control mechanisms and synapse formation will be assessed as outcome measures. Aim\n2 uses an in vivo rat model of dietary fetal-neonatal ID to test whether fetal iron treatment is necessary\nand sufficient to prevent permanent abnormalities in hippocampal mitochondrial structure/function,\nepigenetics, neuron structure and neurocognitive behavior in adulthood. This proposal is highly significant\nbecause it will provide neurobiologically-based mechanistic evidence to delineate accurate timing and dosing of\niron repletion and inform adjunct therapy strategies to reduce the lifelong consequences of fetal-neonatal ID.",

We propose three new branches of work\nthat follow in the spirit of our previous grant cycle, building off of the key observations that listening effort is\ntightly related to comprehension rather than phonetic accuracy, and that effort can emerge at distinct moments\nin time before, during and after the listening process. The new aims focus on the effort of preparing to listen,\nthe effort of aiming attention at particular moments during listening, and the effort that lingers while a person is\ncomprehending the meaning of what was heard. The experiments are guided by the lived experiences of\npeople with cochlear implants, who regularly offer interpretation and suggestions on studies that illuminate the\nsituations that pose recurring problems in their daily communication. Our team of clinically trained scientists\nand language/hearing experts integrates this input into rigorous designs that capitalize on our strength in\ncreating stimuli, measuring listening effort, and sharing our resources with the field. Different aspects of effort\nneed to be distinguished in order to better alleviate the associated costs. For example, effort of recovering from\nmistakes is different than the anxiety of listening. Overall high overexertion could be distinguished from\nexertion that simply lasts too long.

We investigate outstanding\nquestions in GPCR-G protein selectivity and cell surface receptor activation of myosins. Studies will advance the\nfundamental cell biology of GPCRs and myosins, while delivering new therapeutic strategies to combat disease.\nBuilding on new technologies and conceptual advances from my lab, we propose five parallel research projects.\n(1) We discovered and characterized the temporal coupling of sequential GPCR-G protein interactions, leading\nto allokairic modulation of GPCR signaling. We will dissect the structural basis of allokairic modulation through\nthe GPCR\u2019s sequence-divergent third intracellular loop (ICL3). Using novel biosensors and receptor chimeras,\nwe will define roles for ICL3 in autoregulation and G protein selection in closely related receptor isoforms.\n(2) We engineered a simple, accessible cell-free biosensor assay to measure the molecular efficacy of GPCR\nligands. We will use this assay to identify and characterize receptor isoform-selective biologics, including\npeptides, peptide-mimetics, and nanobodies/affibodies. These biologics will serve as probes to advance the\nstructural basis of GPCR-G protein selectivity and yield cell-permeable strategies to selectively target GPCRs.\n(3) We successfully integrated a computation-experiment collaboration to reveal the dynamic reshaping of GPCR\ncytosolic cavities underlying G protein selection. Using this strategy, we will map temporally persistent receptor-\nG protein interaction hot-spots across GPCRs, that encode G protein selectivity. We will dissect the structural\nbasis of allosteric modulators through the dispersal of inter-residue communication networks within GPCRs.\n(4) We identified motor-cargo interaction kinetics and mechanical stiffness as two novel cellular regulatory\nmechanisms of cytoskeletal motors. We will use programmable biomimetic scaffolds to dissect myosin regulation\nthrough both receptor-adaptor and adaptor-motor ensembles. We focus on the impact of motor conformation\nand clustering triggered by diverse cell surface receptors including \u03b21-integrin, plexin D1, and LRP2/megalin.\n(5) We will investigate a novel temporal bias mechanism in GPCR signaling, through receptor-mediated\nengagement of myosins during membrane traffic. We will characterize the differential regulation of motor activity\nthrough PDZ-binding motifs in the GPCR C-tail. We will use optogenetic/chemogenetic strategies to steer GPCR\ntrafficking and map the temporal signaling profile through second messenger and Akt/MAPK pathways.",

We address unresolved contemporary problems through studies that lead to i) new ways of deducing the\nstructures of novel chemical entities, often through innovative use of NMR methodologies, ii) new insights\nabout how chemical reactions, including spontaneous biosynthetic transformations, proceed, and iii) new ways\nto make molecules that have structural features of interest to researchers pursuing targets with promising bio-\nlogical properties. We will capitalize on recent accomplishments and launch new efforts as follows.\n I. Natural Products Chemistry\n A. We remain interested in unraveling key steps in the biosynthesis of natural products that proceed in\nthe absence of enzymatic catalysis\u2014that is, spontaneously. Two specific hypotheses related to the origin of\nthe unique skeleton of ottelione A drive current work: i) an unprecedented, low-barrier Cope rearrangement\nfashions the strange, dearomatized 4-methylenecyclohexenone present in this secondary metabolite and ii) a\nsimple, achiral diarylheptanoid is oxidatively transformed into the strained and preorganized Cope substrate.\nThe engagement of an outstanding collaborator to use genome mapping approaches will be of great benefit.\n B. We frequently engage in natural product structure determination studies and the development of\nmethodologies of value to those who do the same. These studies have had impact extending well beyond the\nspecific questions that we address. Our record in doing this is strong. One notable example teaches methodol-\nogy for calculation of chemical shifts to the experimentalist who may be a novice computationalist. Our ap-\nproach was the same as that used in the newest developments of probabilistic methods for comparison of\ncomputed vs. experimental NMR chemical shifts to validate structure assignments (DP4, DP4+, DP4-AI, DP5).\nWe find a gap in that some communities have yet to embrace these approaches. We propose to evaluate the\neffectiveness (and limitations) of these methods for structural assessment of various cyclic peptides and then\nto communicate, advertise if you will, these outcomes to benefit future structural studies by peptide chemists.\n II. HDDA-Benzyne Chemistry\n Our discovery of the broad scope of the hexadehydro-Diels\u2013Alder (HDDA) reaction is both exciting and en-\nabling. This work has advanced significantly since the onset of our MIRA funding four years ago. The opportu-\nnities in this arena show no sign of abating. To the contrary, it seems that every month or so a coworker arrives\nat my doorstep with yet another new result that elicits from me something to the effect of \u201cWow, HDDA-\nbenzynes will also do that!\u201d Myriad new directions are presented in pages 4\u20136 of the Research Strategy. Many\nwill lead to products containing a greater preponderance of heteroatoms, thereby demonstrating new ap-\nproaches for consideration and use by researchers engaged in drug discovery activities.\n(30 lines)",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nEngineered proteins drive biotechnology and biology as therapeutics, diagnostics, and reagents. While\nengineering the primary function \u2013 e.g. binding \u2013 has become relatively robust, identifying proteins that meet the\nrigors of clinical and practical use remains highly problematic. Many proteins suffer from poor developability \u2013\ninstability, insolubility, low expression, and non-specific binding \u2013 that ultimately limits utility. Protein sequence\nspace is immense, and sequence-function relationships are complex. Thus, more efficient methods are needed\nto map the sequence-developability landscape and reduce the practical burden of identifying developable\nsequences. Robust, quantitative knowledge of the landscape would [1] empower design of libraries constrained\nto developable space, [2] enable design of mutants to rescue lead molecules with compelling primary function\nbut developability liabilities, and [3] enhance fundamental insight of factors that dictate protein\nrobustness. Efficient techniques could also [4] enable integrated, upstream library-scale selection for\ndevelopability. Sequence models are moderately predictive of select metrics but do not robustly quantify the\noverall landscape. Current experimental approaches are inefficient. Thus, creation and implementation of a\nplatform for library-scale evaluation of protein developability would be transformative to accelerate and\nstreamline the protein discovery and engineering pipeline. We will pursue this objective via three specific aims.\nAim 1: Engineer a platform for library-scale evaluation of protein developability. We will develop a set of\ncellular assays that couple [i] genotype-phenotype linkage, [ii] phenotypic stratification via flow cytometric sorting\nor growth competition, and [iii] deep sequencing to efficiently quantify metrics of developability for millions of\nprotein variants thereby elevating developability characterization by orders of magnitude relative to current\nmethods. Aim 2: Elucidate sequence/developability landscapes for binder scaffolds. We will quantitatively\nelucidate sequence-developability landscapes for three ligand scaffolds to [i] empower mutant design to rescue\nlead molecules with compelling primary function but developability liabilities and [ii] to advance fundamental\nunderstanding of the physicochemical principles that dictate protein robustness. Aim 3: Design constrained\nlibraries that yield significantly more developable binders. We will use this insight to design and test\nconstrained combinatorial libraries to yield significantly more developable binders than an unconstrained library.\nWe will test three hypotheses: [i] nested sampling enables the efficient traversal of the sequence/developability\nlandscape to identify an effective constrained library design; [ii] developable space is more evolvable than na\u00efve\nspace (provided library scale diversity is maintained); and [iii] the intersection of developability and evolvability\ncan be effectively identified via these methods.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\n The goal of this proposal is to design new Ti-catalyzed oxidation reactions to modularly assemble pyrazole\nderivatives and difunctionalize alkynes. The rationale for developing Ti catalysis is that Ti is earth-abundant and\ngenerally nontoxic, which obviates the need for efficient catalyst removal and recovery in fine chemical synthesis.\nEarly transition metals can access different structures and elementary reaction steps than late transition metals,\nresulting in bond forming strategies that are complementary or orthogonal to existing technology.\n First, the proposed research concerns developing new dual catalytic strategies for the [2+2+1] synthesis of\npyrazoles. Using preliminary data gained in our laboratory on stoichiometric oxidation-induced N-N reductive\nelimination reactions, we will explore single-electron catalytic and photocatalytic strategies for oxidant turnover.\nDevelopment of a catalytic strategy for electronegative bond couplings like N-N coupling will ultimately lead to\nmild and general dual catalyst systems for the rapid, modular construction of high-value bioactive pyrazoles, and\nalso open avenues for advancing other challenging bond coupling reactions in catalysis.\n Further, we will design selective alkyne carboamination reactions, building off of preliminary results into this\nreaction class. Alkyne carboamination reactions can lead to iminocyclopropanes and unsaturated imines, each\nof which are valuable heterocycle building blocks. Our strategy for selective reaction design will be to use ISPCA,\na new statistical analysis method we have developed that aids in determination of key control factors in a reaction.\nConcurrent refinement of ISPCA along with carboamination catalysis will yield both synthetically practical\nreactions, as well as a tool and roadmap for other catalysis researchers to follow in designing selective reactions.\n Finally, we will use our mechanistic insight of Ti redox catalysis to design new multicomponent alkyne\noxidation reactions. A key focus of this work will be to develop strategies that incorporate more heteroatoms into\nthe products, using our preliminary discoveries in dual catalysis and N-N reductive elimination. These reactions\nwill result in catalytic methods to rapidly produce functional-group rich carbon scaffolds.\n Relevance to public health. Nitrogen heterocycles constitute the single most prevalent class of functional\ngroups in FDA-approved small-molecule drugs: 59% of all unique small molecule drugs contain at least one N-\nheterocycle. Pyrazoles are an important class within this group, and have broad bioactivity. Although many\nreactions to form pyrazoles exist, their synthesis often relies on using potentially toxic and explosive hydrazines,\nand have well-established regioselectivity limitations. A general synthesis of pyrazoles that overcomes these\nlimitations is an unmet challenge. By designing methods to pyrazoles, and more generally to the catalytic\nformation of weak bonds like N-N bonds, synthetic chemists will have rapid and convergent access to diverse\nand novel molecular architectures. These building blocks will aid in the development of new small molecule drug-\nlike architectures for the biomedical community.",

The advancements in methods,\ne.g., viral vectors, genetic approaches, single cell transcriptomics, imaging modalities, optogenetics, and stem\ncell-based approaches, have changed our ability to understand the visual system in health and disease. The\nmajor aim of the University of Minnesota\u2019s program in the Training in Translational Vision Sciences is to prepare\npredoctoral trainees for careers as independent scientists with excellent knowledge of basic science, and\nimportantly, provide connections to clinical problems and real patients with vision-threatening disorders. The 18\ntraining faculty are a well-funded, productive group of vision scientists with a commitment to training the next\ngeneration of vision scientists. Ten of these 18 have funding from the National Eye Institute, but all preceptors\nhave well-funded laboratories and strong publication records. The major areas of research focus include real-\ntime imaging, visual processing in human and animal models, vascular biology, and development. These focus\nareas are typically coupled with a strong translational objective focused on developing new strategies to improve\nvision in individuals with significant visual impairment. We are requesting funding to support five predoctoral\ncandidates who have entered into the laboratories of one of the vision scientist preceptors. Predoctoral trainees\nwill come from one of four graduate programs: \u201cNeuroscience\u201d, \u201cMolecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology &\nGenetics\u201d, or \u201cBiochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics\u201d in the medical school, or the Graduate Program\nin Psychology in the College of Liberal Arts. With the focus on translational vision science, we have greatly\nincreased the collaborations between basic scientists and the clinical faculty in the Department of Ophthalmology\nand Visual Neurosciences (DOVN). Several new key elements of the Translational Vision Research Training\nprogram include a newly designed course for trainees, Critical and Translational Reasoning in Visual Science,\nco-taught by the training faculty and the clinical faculty in the DOVN. All trainees must attend and present their\nresearch at our annual Spring Symposium, where nationally known and in-house experts in vision science\npresent their most recent research along with our trainees and faculty as well as participate in one of several\nvision-related journal clubs. The Program Directors and Executive Committee select and evaluate trainees for\nthis program. The program directors are Linda McLoon PhD and Harald Junge PhD, both in the DOVN. We have\nbuilt in a Program Director transition plan, with Drs. McLoon and Junge sharing the position during the first two\nyears of the program, and with Dr. Junge taking over as Principal Investigator in years three to five. As we move\ntoward increasingly collaborative research between our basic and clinically trained faculty members, the training\nwe provide will maximize our ability to prepare vision scientists with a multi-disciplinary education needed to\nmeet the \u201caudacious goals\u201d of the NEI - focused on preventing, treating, and rehabilitating blinding eye disease.",

There is a well-recognized need to train biomedical scientists in an interdisciplinary and translational field that focuses on the interactions of drugs of abuse with the nervous and immune systems and integrates our understanding of these physiological interactions with their behavioral counterparts. We will accomplish this by offering an intensive 10- week research experience that will provide undergraduate students the necessary academic and research skills to ensure their competitiveness toward entering the next phases of their career - i.e., doctoral programs or professional schools- medical, dental or veterinary school. The PNI summer program is part of the comprehensive Life Science Undergraduate Research Program (LSSURP) at the University of Minnesota. The PNI summer program is composed of an intensive laboratory-based research experience that entails close interaction with and mentorship by a program faculty member that focuses on drug abuse research. This laboratory work is supplemented by a comprehensive educational curriculum, which includes seminars by program faculty on topics in biomedical research, ethics, and laboratory safety, and a focused student research poster symposium. An innovative component of our PNI program proposal is to deliver education modules with small group discussion. In addition, Dr. Jesse L. Mason, an alumnus of LSSURP and the T32 PNI training program, will provide a series of sessions for PNI summer students targeted toward dealing with adversity as a graduate student. Three measures of evaluation will be collected on a yearly basis: 1) Assessment of the 10-week summer research experience by participating undergraduate students and faculty in the program. This assessment will come in two ways from the LSSURP survey and a PNI specific survey; 2) The PNI program itself will be supported by the Advisory Committee to verify that we are meeting the goals of the program and 3) Outcome assessment of the students that were in the program.

    "abstract_text": "Abstract.\nNatural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that can be targeted to multiple tumor antigens with exquisite\nspecificity by anti-tumor antibodies, resulting in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). This is\na key mechanism of action by several clinically successful monoclonal antibody (mAbs) therapies; however,\nmost patients exhibit or acquire resistance to this immunotherapy. ADCC by human NK cells is exclusively\nmediated by CD16A (Fc\u03b3RIIIA), a low affinity IgG Fc receptor. Patient data indicates that increasing the binding\naffinity between CD16A and antibodies augments the clinical response to therapeutic mAbs. Therefore, we\ngenerated a recombinant Fc\u03b3R consisting of the extracellular region of CD64 (Fc\u03b3RI), the only high affinity IgG\nFc receptor, and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of CD16A, a potent activating receptor. NK cells\nderived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) engineered to express CD64/16A mediated robust ADCC.\nMoreover, CD64/16A could function as a docking platform for anti-tumor mAbs, arming NK cells with\nswitchable and mixable tumor targeting elements. Our goal is to generate an optimized recombinant CD64\nexpressed by iPSC-derived NK cells (iNK cells). A compelling scientific premise is provided to support our\nhypothesis that recombinant CD64 expressed by iNK cells can modulate their activation and enhance their\nbinding to tumor targeting mAbs and cancer cells. Our study will focus on epithelial ovarian cancer, the most\nlethal gynecologic malignancy, as strategies to enhance ADCC have yet to be carefully investigated. Our\nhypothesis will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Determination of the in vitro and in vivo ADCC efficacy of\niNK cells expressing recombinant CD64; 2) optimization of recombinant CD64 signaling in iNK cells to enhance\nADCC and their in vivo durability; and 3) evaluation of the \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d use of iNK cells expressing\nrecombinant CD64 in a preclinical ovarian cancer model, including a high grade serous ovarian cancer patient-\nderived xenograft. The impact of our study is that it investigates an innovative engineered NK cell platform to\nexpress a novel recombinant Fc\u03b3R to be used in combination with mAb therapies for universal tumor antigen\ntargeting. Our study involves a diverse team of experts with a track record of progressing basic research to the\nclinic for cancer immunotherapy.",

Based on surveys of medical students, as well as on an analysis by a faculty-driven Medical Student\nResearch Task Force, we identified research training in the summer between years 1 and 2 as the critical\nopportunity to capture the interests and talents of academically minded medical students. Thus, this T35\ncompetitive renewal application for a \u201cMedical Student Summer Research Program in Infection and Immunity\u201d\nrepresents our plan to continue to provide high quality medical student research instruction and mentorship.\nOur long-term objective is to significantly increase the number and diversity of medical students that obtain\npaid employment in medical research, that publish during medical school, and that eventually enter into\nphysician-scientist training pathway residency programs. To this end, we describe herein our activities during\nthe first 5 years of the program (including years 1-4 of this funded T35 grant) and offer the results of our\ncurrent efforts based on the performance and perceptions of 30 medical student summer researchers. Daniel\nMueller, MD, initially developed this Medical Student Summer Research Program in Infection and Immunity,\nand will continue to lead this T35 training grant. He has a breadth of experience in academic medicine\nincluding a) laboratory-based research that includes both fundamental and human-oriented investigation into\nautoimmune disease pathogenesis, b) medical leadership as a division director, c) an extensive undergraduate\nand pre-doctoral training record, and d) direct patient care in Rheumatology. Mueller will be assisted by\nnumerous Medical School leaders with records of success in research and mentorship, and will receive\nadditional financial support from the Chair of Medicine and the Dean of the Medical School. A total of 31\noutstanding Center for Immunology faculty members will serve as the preceptors for 7 summer medical\nstudents in each year of the grant period. Diverse student candidates will be approached by the T35 director\non an individual basis, and encouraged to apply to the program. Students entering the program will receive\ndirect instruction in scientific investigation for a period of 2 months. Students will also receive weekly instruction\nthat relates the function of the immune system to human health. Training experiences will include the writing of\na formal \u201cSpecific Aims Page\u201d proposal, as well as a \u201cProgress Report\u201d final summary of their research. In\naddition, fellows will prepare and present to Center for Immunology faculty both a scientific poster and oral\npresentation of their work. Finally, trainees will be given the opportunity for longitudinal mentorship regarding\nthe physician-scientist career path throughout their medical school experience. Success in this program will be\nmonitored both through longitudinal surveys of students and training faculty as well as through oversight by\nboth Internal and External Advisors.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nAPOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD with Ab-dependent and Ab-independent effects on\ndisease pathogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenic nature of APOE4 are not\nfully elucidated. In previous funding period, we have demonstrated that APOE4-induced phosphoinositol\nbiphosphate (PIP2) dyshomeostasis through the increased expression of a PIP2-degrading enzyme, synaptojanin\n1 (synj1). In parallel, a non-biased multiscale network analysis of human dataset from the AMP-AD consortium\nidentifies synj1 as a key driver in both male and female AD subnetworks. Synj1 reduction has been found to\nprovide several beneficial effects such as rescuing APOE4-associated cognitive impairments and lysosomal\ndefects. Notably, we discovered that APOE4+ microglia have higher synj1 expression at baseline, and that\nAPOE4+ microglia manifests with impaired phagocytic activities and lysosomal defects when compared to\nAPOE3+ microglia which can be rescued by synj1 haploinsufficiency. A pilot study indicates that lowering synj1\nexpression in E4FAD mice protects against cuprizone-induced chronic neuro-inflammation and cognitive/motor\ndeficits in vivo. We postulate that the APOE-synj1-PIP2 signal pathway plays a functional role in regulating\nmicroglial function, and that dysregulated microglial synj1-PIP2 homeostasis induced by APOE4 may lead to\ndysregulated immune function and excessive synaptic elimination, promoting APOE4-associated\nneuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. Therefore, we will characterize the regulation of microglial function\nby the APOE-synj1-PIP2 signaling pathway during aging and AD pathogenesis in this renewal application. We\npropose to 1) investigate microglial synj1 function in modulating APOE4-regulated neuroinflammation in AD in\nvivo (Aim 1) using cuprizone-induced inflammation in male and female EFAD mouse models (human ApoE4\nknock-in at 5xFAD background); 2) to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which the APOE-synj1-PIP2\nsignaling pathway regulates microglial function (Aim 2) using mouse microglia from EFAD mice (synj1+/+ and\nsynj1+/-), mouse microglia from TREM2-/- or APOE-/- mice, and human iPSC-derived microglia from APOE3+/+\nand APOE4+/+ normal and AD subjects; 3) to investigate temporal and spatial relationship between dysregulated\nmicroglial function and excessive neurite and synaptic elimination using ex vivo 3-D co-culture of iPSC-derived\nbrain cells; 4) to perform high resolution multiscale network modeling using scRNA-seq dataset from mouse\nbrains and RNA-seq dataset from human iPSC-derived microglia and co-culture to identify microglia-specific\nmolecular signatures driven by APOE-synj1-PIP2 signaling; and 5) to validate identified molecular signature in\npost-mortem human brain samples (Aim 3). The goals of this application aim to elucidate novel pathways and\nmolecular signatures underlying APOE4-induced microglial dysfunction. These studies will facilitate identification\nand development of a more personalized targeted therapy to APOE-regulated neuroinflammation in AD.",

    "abstract_text": "Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a rare inherited mucocutaneous disease caused by\nmutations to the COL7A1 gene. Advancements in gene therapy have opened avenues for treatment by\nintroducing a functional copy of the mutated gene in the patient\u2019s cells. Viral vectors, gene editing nucleases,\nbase editors, and prime editors are potential strategies for restoring expression of COL7A1. Lenti-, retro-, and\nherpes simplex virus (HSV) approaches are all being employed clinically. Ex vivo cell correction with integrating\nvectors (i.e. lenti- or retroviral) requires specialized facilities for engineering cells and these systems pose\ninsertional mutagenic risks that are a consideration in the RDEB phenotype that has a predisposition to\naggressive squamous cell carcinoma development. HSV-1 is a non-integrating vector that reduces genome\ntoxicity related safety concerns but episomal nucleic acid could be lost over time. All of these viral vector systems\nmediate supranormal gene expression levels. In situ, locus specific correction is desirable as it retains the\nendogenous gene regulatory network and minimizes insertional mutagenesis. Here we will evaluate highly\npromising genome engineering and delivery approaches as part of a strategy to restore COL7A1 expression in\ncells ex vivo and in vivo. In the first aim, we will define and optimize evolved engineered Prime Assisted Site-\nSpecific Integrase Gene Editing (eePASSIGE), a powerful addition to the genome engineering armamentarium.\nPolymeric nanoparticles (PNP) will be employed for the delivery of eePASSIGE nucleic acids that will install a\nfull length COL7A1 cDNA into the endogenous locus ex vivo and in vivo.

In the second aim, we will develop a novel microfluidics-based epidermal poration device to deliver\neePASSIGE PNPs topically to mice for in vivo, permanent COL7A1 gene correction. Both aims will then be\nsynergized to assess the combinatorial potential of topical and cell-based therapy to ameliorate the cutaneous\nand internal disease manifestations toward filling a therapeutic gap in current treatment options. Our proposed\nexperiments will develop a novel ex vivo and in vivo genome editing strategy that could be broadly applied across\nall RDEB patient cohorts and that will enhance overall efficiency and correct the full spectrum of the disease.",

To\nmeet the challenge of developing new and effective therapies to treat these disorders, we need\nto consistently inspire intelligent and talented undergraduate students to enter careers in\nneuroscience research. This need is particularly acute among populations of students who are\ncurrently underrepresented in the field of neuroscience research. Published analyses have\nmade it clear that making students aware of research fields early in their college careers,\nespecially by involving them directly in the research process, is an extremely effective way of\ndeveloping a student\u2019s interest in research as a future profession. For over 30 years, the\nUniversity of Minnesota has recognized and met this challenge by offering summer residential\nresearch programs in biomedical sciences. This proposal is to fund a neuroscience component\nof these summer programs in which we will train 8 undergraduate students who have completed\ntheir freshman or sophomore years in college. We will recruit students nationally, focusing on\nstudents from groups that are underrepresented within the neuroscience research profession,\nincluding economically disadvantaged and disabled students. We will provide them with a 10-\nweek intensive residential research experience that will include professional mentoring\n(academic survival skills and preparation for graduate school) as well as workshops on research\nethics. Our goals are to inspire a new generation of neuroscience researchers as well as to\ncreate a national mentoring pool who will accept that responsibility for future generations of\nstudents. In turn, we expect these individuals to become part of the research infrastructure\ndedicated to solving medical problems of nervous system dysfunction.",

The CGC is the sole general stock\ncenter for the curation and distribution of C. elegans. The CGC currently houses 23,000 different strains, and\nthey are immensely popular: ~30,000 strains are distributed to thousands of laboratories each year, and the\nmajority are sent to user groups in the United States. Strains are distributed upon request through an on-line\nordering system with a scheme of user fees in place to help defray costs and support CGC activities.\nResearchers in all locales supply us with important strains that they have generated. If the CGC were not\nperforming this curation and distribution service, strain sharing would be extremely inefficient and costly; the\nburden of filling requests would be placed upon individual labs, likely leading to delays in the exchange of\nresearch materials. Moreover, the conservation of many published strains might be in jeopardy. This would be\na great loss, because research in this model organism has led to fundamental insights into basic biological\nmechanisms, including programmed cell death, axonal guidance, and the mechanism of RNA interference in\nanimals. C. elegans has also provided insights to mechanisms of cancer progression and neurodegenerative\ndiseases, and this nematode serves as a key model for illuminating the biology of parasitic nematodes, a major\nhealth concern. In addition to enhancing research progress, the CGC Resource Component offers major cost-\nsavings to the NIH as a whole, to individual research labs funded by NIH, and to all other labs in the\ncommunity. These savings are achieved through decreasing redundant labor by making new mutations and\nmutant combinations readily available, decreasing labor and other costs by providing an economy-of-scale\napproach rather than having individual labs responsible for disseminating useful strains, safeguarding strains\nmade with NIH grant support through curation in redundant sites, and facilitating the use of this relatively low-\ncost model by investigators working primarily in high-cost models such as mice.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\u2014Applied Research Component\nThe Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) seeks to enhance the efficiency with which scientists can make\nbiomedical research advances using a premier model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans. Analysis of transgenic\nanimals is an integral part of essentially all model organism research. The introduction of fluoresent protein (FP)\ntags to animal models by Nobel Laureate Martin Chalfie in 1994, using C. elegans, profoundly revolutionized\ntransgenesis by allowing gene expression to be monitored in real time in living organisms. For genes with low\nlevel expression, detection of fluorescent protein fusions can be challenging, driving interest in ever more bright\nand photostable variations of fluorescent proteins. In addition, many applications call for multi-plexing of\nfluorescently tagged proteins, increasing demand for new proteins with non-overlapping emission spectra. Thus,\ndevelopment of that first green fluorescent protein has inspired discovery and design of numerous variations that\ncan differ in color, brightness, photostability and time to maturation. However, these characteristics can be\nimpacted by environmental conditions such that in vitro properties may not hold in vivo, posing a challenge for\nresearchers looking to expand their FP palette. When a new FP is developed with highly touted characteristics,\nthe in vitro characterized parameters allow selection of good candidates to test in vivo, but adoption of a new\nprotein by the worm community requires significant optimization and in vivo testing. This project will eliminate\nuncertainties about the in vivo use of new fusion proteins for the C. elegans community by direct quantitative\ncomparison of a set of new FPs relative to each other and to those currently in broad use. Data derived from this\nproject will be used by the C. elegans community broadly to improve experimental designs for diverse research\nquestions, and by researchers using other model organisms to suggest the best candidate FPs to test in vivo in\ntheir systems. This project will also result in a set of C. elegans strains expressing FPs for laboratories to test on\ntheir own microscopes and/or on demonstration equipment they are considering for purchase. Finally, this project\nwill establish a set of common metrics with which to evaluate future FPs ensuring rigor and reproducibility of\ntesting. All strains and reagents generated in this work will be curated by the CGC and immediately available to\nthe community.",

    "abstract_text": "The development of liver metastasis is dependent upon bidirectional interactions between cancer cells and\nthe liver microenvironment. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2), released from cancer cells and other\nresident liver cells, induces activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into myofibroblasts that in turn\npromote liver metastasis. The long-term goal of our program is to define mechanisms governing HSC\nactivation and develop strategies to target HSCs and the prometastatic liver microenvironment. Recent\nadvances suggest that HSCs are fueled by aerobic glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and free cholesterol, but\nmechanistic regulation of HSC metabolism is not fully defined. Glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) is a\npredominant glucose transporter isoform expressed by hepatic fibroblasts and it has to be on the plasma\nmembrane for glucose to be transported into cells. Our Preliminary Data demonstrate that TGF\u03b21 induces\nendosome-to-plasma-membrane translocation of Glut1 and glucose uptake into HSCs by a mechanism\ndependent on non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src (Src) and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein\n(VASP). While Src interacts with the small Rab GTPase Rab11 and Glut1 at the endosome, VASP interacts\nwith Glut1 at the plasma membrane. Additionally, knockdown of Glut1 suppresses myofibroblastic activation of\nHSCs in vitro and tumor-promoting effects of HSCs in a tumor/HSC co-implantation mouse model. These\nfindings led to the Central Hypothesis that the TGF\u03b21-induced localization of Glut1 on the plasma membrane\nand the subsequent glucose transport into HSCs that fuels HSC activation are mediated by Src at the\nendosome and VASP at the plasma membrane. In Aim 1, we will study how Src promotes Glut1 trafficking\ntowards the plasma membrane, with a focus on its regulation on Rab11 activation at the endosome. We will\nalso investigate how Src is activated in TGF\u03b21-stimulated HSCs. In Aim 2, we will elucidate how VASP retains\nGlut1 at the plasma membrane and promotes glucose transport into HSCs. We will also interrogate whether a\nlipid signaling pathway induces VASP phosphorylation in TGF\u03b21-stimulated HSCs. In Aim 3, we will use\nconditional SLC2A1/Glut1 knockout mice and portal vein tumor injection to test if HSC-specific Glut1 deletion\nsuppresses HSC activation and colorectal liver metastasis in mice. We will also co-inject HSCs and tumor cells\ninto the livers of mice to test if the interplay between Src and VASP modulates plasma membrane Glut1,\nglucose transport into HSCs, and HSC activation within the hepatic tumor microenvironment. The proposed\nwork will reveal novel mechanisms related to metabolic regulation of HSC activation induced by TGF\u03b2, which\nwill help to identify new targets to inhibit HSC activation and the prometastatic liver microenvironment.",

Due to their broad understanding of animal anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and disease,\nthey possess key knowledge for cross-species comparative medicine and for experimentally-induced\nand naturally occurring animal models of human diseases. Veterinarian-scientists also provide\ncontributions to human welfare through critical roles in One Health initiatives, including in global food\nsecurity and in emerging and zoonotic diseases and ecosystem health. One key area of importance is\nthat approximately 75% of recenUy emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are diseases of\nanimal origin some of which are in wildlife reservoirs. However, the US National Research Council, an\nNIH Physician-Scientist Workforce Working Group Report, and the NIH Office of Research Infrastructure\nPrograms have all emphasized that the veterinarian-scientist workforce is far underrepresented and\nunderutilized in biomedical research. Reasons for this include limited access by veterinary students to\nbiomedical research programs and appropriate training. The objective of our \"Veterinary Summer\nScholars in Comparative Medicine\" T35 training program is to provide direct biomedical research\nexperiences to first and second-year veterinary students in order to increase the numbers of\nresearchers in the veterinary-scientist pipeline. Our approach will consist of 1) providing opportunities to\nconduct comparative biomedical research in an environment of collaboration and discovery by mentors\nwho are basic and clinician-scientists, and 2) providing research training in the form of lectures,\ndiscussions and activities focused on responsible conduct and ethics in research, experimental design\nand quality assurance, conflict management, research communication, and career pathways in the\nbiomedical sciences. New innovations described in this renewal application include additional science\ncommunication sessions, increased opportunities for continued research experiences during veterinary\nschool, as well as more interprofessional interactions by our T35 trainees with other health professionals\nin the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI}, with trainees in our CVM T32\nComparative Medicine Training grant, and other similar health sciences programs to promote\nteam-science. The proposed T35 training program involves a critical mass of faculty mentors from our\nhealth sciences schools (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Medicine) at the University of\nMinnesota for providing multidisciplinary and state-of-the-art research experiences.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nDespite advances in tobacco smoking cessation interventions (pharmacological and behavioral), most\nsmokers do not succeed at quitting, creating a major public health burden. Stress is one of the most\ncommonly reported precipitants of tobacco craving and relapse. Tobacco withdrawal is associated with\nescalation of negative affect symptoms; our research has found multiple stress-related physiological and\nhormonal alterations during withdrawal that predict relapse. Modifying these stress-related biobehavioral\nchanges may prove useful in reducing effects of stress. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid of\ncannabis with low abuse liability that has received increased attention in the retail market and cannabis\nresearch. Although CBD is aggressively marketed for addressing stress, little research has been done to\ncharacterize CBD\u2019s physiological and mood effects, their implications in managing tobacco withdrawal\nsymptoms, and the mechanism by which CBD may influence these symptoms. Our research will address\nthese timely issues. This application builds on our current and previous funding periods (PI: al\u2019Absi,\nR01DA027232) demonstrating that stress-related hormonal changes during tobacco withdrawal predict\nrelapse. We have shown that tobacco dependence is linked with: 1) enhanced basal hypothalamic-pituitary-\nadrenocortical (HPA) activity; 2) blunted cortisol response to multiple stressors; 3) disrupted opioid\nregulation of the stress response; 4) association of attenuated stress response and early relapse; and 5)\nsex differences in changes during withdrawal and predictors of relapse; hormonal responses are better\npredictors of relapse in men, while withdrawal symptoms and craving are stronger predictors of relapse in\nwomen. Our recent research has also documented blunted emotion regulation among cannabis users. In\nthe new cycle, we plan to conduct a multi-site, multi-group, multi-dose, double blind, within-subject study.\nWe will address the following specific aims: 1) Determine the acute effect of CBD on the psychobiological\nmechanisms of the stress response in healthy participants; 2) Examine how tobacco dependence influences\nthe acute effect of CBD on psychobiological mechanisms of the stress response; 3) Determine the effect of\nCBD on tobacco withdrawal-related changes in psychobiological mechanisms of the stress response in\ntobacco users; 4) Explore sex differences in the psychobiological mechanisms of the stress response and\nacute effects of CBD in dependent tobacco users. This research is the first to examine CBD's effect during\nexposure to acute stress and tobacco withdrawal using relevant measures that are known to be sensitive to\nacute stress and to tobacco withdrawal. The research builds on important preliminary results and uses\nrigorous, reproducible procedures.",

FSHD afflicts over 25,000 individuals in the United\nStates, is a very common genetic disease, and is currently without treatment. In the previous cycle of this renewal\napplication, we discovered that DUX4 gene expression is self-limited to short bursts of activity, with the DUX4\ntarget gene DUXA serving as a feedback inhibitor, and a degron in the C-terminus leading to protein instability.\nWe also discovered that transient DUX4 expression in muscle fibers in our iDUX4pA doxycycline-inducible\nmouse model tips muscle into an injury-sensitive pro-fibrotic state mediated by long-term changes to the FAP\ncompartment, and developed a p300-specific inhibitor, iP300w, for treating DUX4-induced disease, including\nfinding that iP300w inhibits CIC-DUX4, a fusion oncoprotein that causes a very aggressive pediatric sarcoma.\nThe renewal application builds on this work, with a series of studies aimed at continuing to explore the molecular\nmechanism of DUX4 activity by understanding the function of proteins that interact with DUX4 including those\nthat degrade it, developing p300 inhibition as a therapeutic approach, and investigating pathological mechanisms\nunderlying DUX4-mediated skeletal muscle disease using transient and cell type-restricted expression of DUX4\nin the iDUX4pA mouse model.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nWhile smoking cessation efforts have resulted in a decrease in smoking and lung cancer rates, lung cancer\nremains the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both men and\nwomen. Currently, at least half of the newly incident lung cancer cases are former smokers in the US. Moreover,\nthere are racial/ethnic differences in smoking-related lung cancer risk; however, it is unclear of the extent these\ndifferences persist after smoking cessation. Low-dose CT screening for lung cancer has been shown to reduce\nlung cancer mortality by ~20%; however, screening recommendations are limited to current smokers and recent\nquitters (within 15 years) who were moderate or heavy smokers (\u226520 pack-year smoking history), which does\nnot address risk among those who have quit >15 years and/or who are light smokers. Prior genetic, epigenetic,\nand molecular marker studies have shown that differences in the frequencies or levels of these markers, may\nhelp to better understand risk differences across populations. Our data suggests that smoking may differentially\ninfluence DNA methylation levels across populations and that genetic, epigenetic, and biochemical markers of\nsmoking may be associated with lung cancer risk in a multiethnic population independent of self-reported\nsmoking data. The objective of this proposal is to improve the understanding of the mechanisms of lung cancer\nrisk in a former smoker population. We propose to evaluate the impact of smoking cessation on lung cancer risk\nacross five racial/ethnic groups from the Multiethnic Cohort study (MEC) with disparate risk of disease (Aim 1).\nWe will conduct an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of years quit among former smokers from the\nMEC (Aim 2). Lastly, we will systematically investigate the association of genetic variants and DNA methylation\nfrom blood leukocytes and urinary cadmium levels (Aim 3) with risk of lung cancer. Additionally, we will interact\nwith the other three projects in this P01 to study the influence of CYP2A6 genetic variants in relation to years\nquit (Project 2), the association of genetic variants with markers of the exposome (Project 3) and the association\nfor urinary phenanthrene metabolite ratio with DNA methylation of AHRR (Project 4). We hypothesize that\nethnic/racial and individual differences in lung cancer risk in former smokers are in part due to variations in\ngenetics and different biological response to smoking cessation. The findings from this study will expand our\nunderstanding of risk and potential mechanisms for lung cancer in a multiethnic population of former smokers.\nThis will help to identify for screening those individuals remaining at greatest risk of lung cancer despite them\nhaving taken the major step of quitting smoking to reduce their risk.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nIn the United States this year, an estimated 235,760 new lung cancer cases will be diagnosed. The vast\nmajority of those are attributable to smoking. However, only 11-24% of smokers will develop lung cancer and\nthe risk among smokers varies significantly. Individual differences in nicotine metabolism can influence that\nrisk by influencing the intensity of smoking. The primary catalyst of nicotine metabolism is CYP2A6, and we\nhave demonstrated an association of CYP2A6 activity with the risk of lung cancer. These data are from a\nsubcohort of ~2200 smokers with nicotine metabolism biomarker data in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC). The\nrisk of lung cancer varies across racial/ethnic group as does the contribution of CYP2A6 activity to that risk.\nIn this project, we propose to develop a genetic score to predict CYP 2A6-catalyzed nicotine metabolism and\nto determine the association of that score with the lung cancer risk of ever smokers in the MEC. The gene\nthat encodes CYP2A6 is notoriously polymorphic. The high homology between CYP2A6 and the pseudogene\nCYP2A7, the many variant alleles of each, and their unique distribution by racial/ethnic group complicates the\naccurate genotyping of functional variants. However, correctly characterizing an individual's CYP2A6 alleles\nis integral to the genotype-guided prediction of nicotine metabolism, and to the complete characterization of\nCYP2A6 variation in multiethnic populations. The related gene CYP2D6 has similar genetic complexities and\nis equally challenging to genotype. However, recent advances have led to the successful application of long-\nrange sequencing approaches to accurate CYP2D6 variant calling. We propose to use a similar targeted\nsequencing approach to characterize CYP2A6 genetic diversity across racial/ethnic groups. The improved\ncharacterization of CYP2A6 will allow the comprehensive study of the role of CYP2A6 variants in tobacco-\nrelated lung cancer and ultimately better identify those at greatest risk for lung cancer and target them for\nprevention strategies. The overall hypothesis of our research is that variation in CYP2A6 activity contributes\nto the observed racial/ethnic disparities in lung cancer risk, and that the relative contribution of CYP2A6\nactivity to risk varies by racial/ethnic group based on the prevalence of metabolically important CYP2A6\nvariants. The following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To characterize the genetic diversity of CYP2A6 in\nNative Hawaiians relative to Japanese Americans and Whites.

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThis T32 regional postdoctoral training grant in eating disorders research is a competitive renewal application for an Institutional Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA that was initially awarded in 2009. This multisite postdoctoral training program aims to prepare the next generation of scientists to advance the field of eating disorders research. The mortality risks and disease burden associated with eating disorders necessitate highly innovative and impactful investigations conducted by well-trained scientists. Mechanistic studies of the neurobiological, psychological, and environmental causes and maintenance factors of eating disorders that can be targeted in novel treatment and prevention programs are especially critical and remain a focus of our training program. This multidisciplinary T32 program combines the long-standing strengths of eating disorders research programs at the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN), the University of Chicago (Chicago, IL), and Sanford Center for Biobehavioral Research (Fargo, ND) to train emerging scientists in state-of-the-art research methods. Comprehensive training is provided in the context of mentored research and weekly T32 seminars as well as coursework. Trainees include 2 postdoctoral fellows at each site with training durations of 2-3 years. T32 faculty across the three sites include 23 experts in eating disorders and related conditions who represent multiple disciplines including psychology, psychiatry, epidemiology, dietetics, neuroscience, and biostatistics. Each postdoctoral fellow is paired with an on-site primary mentor as well as a multisite mentoring team to identify and pursue individualized training goals. Training progress is monitored with the use of Individual Development Plans that are regularly reviewed and updated. Through their mentored research experiences, seminars, coursework, and on-site learning opportunities, postdoctoral fellows develop advanced skills in conducting rigorous research, publishing manuscripts, and submitting grant applications. Multisite collaborations are strongly supported. Research ethics, scientific rigor, and reproducibility are emphasized throughout the training program. Currently in its 14th year, this T32 program continues to be successful with a competitive applicant pool and high levels of research productivity among current and previous trainees in both publications and grant awards.",

    "abstract_text": "Strength loss occurs with age affecting quality of life and impinges upon healthspan. 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2)\ndeficiency in females also causes strength loss. The overall goal of this project is to determine the cellular and\nmolecular mechanisms through which E2 deficiency perturbs skeletal muscle and contractile functions with\nage. The sole focus of our research has been on aging females and in this competitive renewal submission,\nwe also seek to determine mechanisms of E2 in male muscle as the impact of estrogens in male non-\nreproductive physiology is becoming increasingly recognized. Results from the previous funding periods have\nled to novel hypotheses outlined in this proposal. Specifically, Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that E2 signals\nthrough estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) and the G protein-coupled ER (GPER) in skeletal muscle to enhance\ndynamic strength in male as well as female mice. We use genetic, surgical, and pharmacologic approaches to\nprobe both the ligand and receptor sides of E2-ER signaling. We pair this approach with comprehensive in\nvivo and in vitro measures of muscle contractile functions to elucidate mechanisms and determine the long-\nterm consequence of E2-ER disruption in muscle. While the particular muscle proteins to be analyzed in the\nfirst aim are guided by specific contractile outcomes that are affected by E2-ER signaling, Aim 2 takes an\nunbiased approach to quantitate phosphoproteins that are critical for strength yet altered in aged and E2-\ndeficient muscle. This will be accomplished through the development of a novel parallel reaction monitoring\n(PRM) assay with computational modeling, which is based on our global phosphoproteomic work that\nidentified differentially expressed phospho-peptides related to calcium signaling and contractile proteins in\nseveral E2-replete vs E2-deficient muscle conditions. Our customized PRM assay will further predict\ncandidate E2-sensitive kinases that will be validated in high-throughput assays to yield potential\ngerotherapeutic targets for preserving muscle strength with age. It has been shown that 17alpha-E2, the minor\nand weak epimer of E2, extends lifespan and improves several characteristics of healthspan in male mice.\nAim 3 is designed to test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle will be enhanced by 17alpha-E2 in both aged\nmales and females through activation of ER\u03b1 and downstream signaling. This aim brings forth the intriguing\nprospect that 17alpha-E2 is a non-feminizing geroprotector that extends healthspan by supporting muscle\nstrength and thus physical activity, movement, and quality of life. Accomplishing these three aims will solidify\nthat change in sex hormones and their receptors is one of the pleiotropic mechanisms underlying muscle\nweakness with age and addresses the long-term goal of our research program, which is to determine\nestrogenic mechanisms that preserve strength with aging, regardless of sex.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\nWith 494 billion data points and 62 million map polygons, IPUMS National Historical Geographic Information\nSystem (NHGIS) is the world\u2019s largest publicly accessible population database and is an essential component\nof the shared data infrastructure for population and health research. NHGIS gathers area-level U.S. census data\nfrom diverse sources, formats them consistently, develops comprehensive standardized machine-processable\nmetadata, and creates high-precision GIS boundary files describing the spatial units. To eliminate major\nobstacles for studies of small-area population change, NHGIS distributes geographic time series that link\ncomparable data across multiple census years. The data are broadly accessible to health researchers through\npowerful dissemination tools that make it easy to navigate the intricacies of the U.S. statistical system, enabling\nrigorous and reproducible population health research. NHGIS reduces costs for population and health\nresearchers by minimizing redundant effort, simplifying data access, and improving data reliability. NHGIS\ncurrently disseminates 12 terabytes of data per year to 81,900 investigators, with a new citation of NHGIS\nappearing in Google Scholar once every 14 hours. To meet the demands of a rapidly increasing user base and\never-expanding requests for more and improved data, this project has five major goals: 1. Add to core census\ndatasets. The proposed project will incorporate new releases of American Community Survey (ACS) summary\ndata with corresponding boundary files and broaden the coverage of existing NHGIS datasets with 1980 block\nboundary data for all metropolitan areas, Puerto Rico data from the 1980\u20132000 censuses, and ACS tables for\ndetailed race/ethnicity/tribe/ancestry groups. 2. Add resources to support analysis of noisy 2020 census data.\nTo protect privacy, the Census Bureau is adding noise to 2020 census data, causing some data to be unreliable\nin ways that are difficult to predict. This project will add three key resources to NHGIS to help researchers\nunderstand and account for the added noise: confidence intervals, Noisy Measurement Files, and data for\noptimized block groups. 3. Extend integrated spatiotemporal datasets. To broaden research opportunities, this\nproject will extend NHGIS geographic crosswalks to cover more levels and years, extend time series tables to\ncover more years and subjects, and extend annual estimates of tract-level populations through 2027. 4. Improve\ndata access. The project will give data users new options for code-based access to NHGIS data and metadata\nvia our Application Programming Interface (API) and a Python package. 5. Expand and support the research\ncommunity. The project will invest in extensive user support, training, and outreach, leveraging two new data\nuser networks built with recent NSF and NIA funding to reach new, underrepresented, and early-career scholars.\nThe project team will also develop new guides to key concepts in U.S. census data.",

With\na commitment to fostering inclusivity and empowering underrepresented students, the program has provided\nvital support to 294 talented undergraduate individuals from diverse backgrounds, propelling them towards\nsuccessful baccalaureate degrees. 70% of former students embarked on advanced biomedical degrees,\nincluding MD, PhD, and MD/PhD degrees. These outcomes firmly establish our R25 program as a potent catalyst\nfor nurturing diverse and skilled researchers. Building on its achievements, our program is steadfast in its vision\nto sustain and strengthen its commitment to diversity and educational excellence in the biomedical field. We\nrequest continued funding support to focus on sustaining participant diversity by actively recruiting a diverse and\nacademically qualified group of 12 R25 grant-eligible students from local community colleges and nationwide\neach year (Aim 1). These promising trainees will be offered an enriching ten-week independent research\nexperience mentored by distinguished faculty, while also benefiting from a wide array of enrichment activities.\nWorkshops on responsible research conduct, scientific communication, graduate school applications, career\nmentoring, and addressing issues like implicit bias and imposter syndrome will serve as empowering tools for\nthese aspiring researchers, helping them overcome barriers and succeed in their biomedical careers. In Aim 2,\nthe R25 program centers around strengthening its Pre-Medical Scientist Training Program (Pre-MSTP) module,\nwhich has already achieved significant success with a remarkable 33% of alumni enrolled in or having graduated\nfrom MD/PhD programs. In Aim 3, the R25 program aspires to forge new frontiers of inclusivity by developing an\ninnovative research training module tailored explicitly to the unique needs of community college transfer\nstudents, known as Bio-LEAP (Biomedical Life Science Enrichment for Academic Progress). With a keen\nrecognition of the vast population of underrepresented students transferring from community colleges to the\nUniversity of Minnesota, the Bio-LEAP module will prioritize engaging and nurturing this dynamic group. By\nproviding tailored research training experience, the Bio-LEAP module seeks to facilitate a smoother transition to\nUMN, positively impacting academic progress toward a bachelor's degree, fostering a passion for research, and\nultimately increasing their success in matriculating into competitive advanced biomedical degree programs. In\nsummary, our proposed aims will enhance diversity in the biomedical research workforce, nurture a diverse\ngeneration of well-prepared researchers, and make a lasting positive impact on the mission of the National Heart,\nLung, and Blood Institute, fostering excellence and inclusivity in the biomedical research community.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nWhile abundant skeletal (ask-actin) and cardiac (aca-actin) actin isoforms are famous for their essential role in\nstriated muscle contraction, low abundance non-muscle \u201ccytoplasmic\u201d actin isoforms (bcyto- and gcyto-actin) are\nalso emerging as important in the maintenance of specialized structures (and functions) in normal and\ndiseased skeletal muscle. During this project, we generated and characterized muscle-specific mouse lines\neither lacking or overexpressing bcyto-actin or gcyto-actin to understand their endogenous functions and role(s) in\ndystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. Interestingly, each bcyto-actin or gcyto-actin single knockout develops a\nqualitatively similar phenotype characterized by a progressive myopathy with significant myofiber\ndegeneration/regeneration and muscle weakness. We have shown that skeletal muscle-specific\noverexpression of bcyto-actin or gcyto-actin in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice affords significant protection from\neccentric contraction-induced force drop while overexpression of a C272A mutant of gcyto-actin affords no\nprotection. These and other data suggest that eccentric contraction drives a rapidly-reversible, reactive\noxygen species (ROS)-mediated inhibition of sarcomeric contractility that may function to protect dystrophic\nmuscles from damage caused by repeated, high force contractions. Our new preliminary data show that\nmuscle-specific ablation of bcyto-actin or gcyto-actin from wildtype muscle results in eccentric contraction-induced\nforce drop that is reversed by the nonspecific antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Finally, we have obtained new\ndata suggesting that gcyto-actin is important for repair of membrane damage. Going forward, we will make use\nof our unique animal models, isoform-specific reagents, and biochemical and physiological methodologies to\naddress new fundamental questions about cytoplasmic actins in normal skeletal muscle function and in\ndystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy. In aim 1, we will identify the sources of ROS contributing to eccentric\ncontraction-induced force drop in dystrophic mdx skeletal muscle as well as the downstream targets of ROS\nthat ultimately inhibit force production. In aim 2, we will investigate the role of oxidative stress in driving the\nmyopathy and eccentric contraction-induced force drop associated with genetic ablation of bcyto- or gcyto-actin in\nskeletal muscle. In aim 3, the interplay between cytoplasmic actin isoforms and ROS in membrane repair will\nbe investigated using state-of-the-art imaging approaches to analyze muscles from the same mouse lines\nused in aims 1 and 2. The results of the proposed studies will further delineate the unique and important\ncontributions of cytoplasmic actin isoforms to the function of normal and dystrophic skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nThe long-term objective of this project is to fully define the functions of dystrophin in striated muscle to\nunderstand how its absence or abnormality leads to the pathologies observed in Duchenne and Becker\nmuscular dystrophies, and to inform on the potential for miniaturized dystrophins or utrophin to substitute for\ndystrophin in a therapeutic context. In the current project period, we generated a new line of transgenic mdx\nmice that expresses dystrophin lacking in vitro microtubule binding activity, but which surprisingly presented\nwith a fully rescued cortical microtubule lattice. We also analyzed microtubule organization in existing lines of\ntransgenic mdx mice expressing different truncated dystrophin constructs and found that two different micro-\ndystrophins were less effective than two mini-dystrophins in restoring microtubule organization in mdx\nmuscles. Exciting new preliminary data identified a second region required for microtubule organization and\nshowed that the microtubule lattice of transgenic mdx mice expressing mini- or micro-dystrophins is rapidly\ndisrupted by eccentric contraction through a mechanism involving reactive oxygen species. Thus, the first\ngoal of aim 1 is to generate and characterize two new lines of transgenic mdx mice that will more definitively\nconfirm the regions of dystrophin necessary for stable microtubule lattice organization. Aim 1 will then\nelucidate the relationship between eccentric contraction and reactive oxygen species in disrupting the\nmicrotubule lattice in mdx muscles expressing mini- or micro-dystrophins. Finally, aim 1 will delineate the\ninterplay between the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and cytoplasmic actins in effecting stable cortical\nmicrotubule organization in mature skeletal muscle. We have also recently published atomic force microscopy\ndata suggesting that utrophin may be much stiffer than dystrophin and functionally less equivalent than\npreviously thought. We have acquired exciting preliminary data showing that the cellular system used to\nexpress a model utrophin fragment significantly impacts its mechanical properties. In aim 2, we will extend our\npreliminary studies in bacteria and insect cells to measure the mechanical properties of dystrophin and\nutrophin constructs expressed in mammalian myoblasts. We will then carry out the first mechanical\ncharacterization of single, full-length dystrophin molecules for comparison with our published utrophin data.\nAnd finally, in aim 2 we will investigate how internal truncations affect the mechanical behavior of the most\ntherapeutically-relevant miniaturized dystrophins. Our proposed studies will provide new understanding into\nthe functions of dystrophin and utrophin in healthy muscle and will inform on the potential for miniaturized\ndystrophins and utrophin to functionally replace dystrophin as therapeutic approaches for Duchenne muscular\ndystrophy.",

    "abstract_text": "Summary\nThis proposal seeks continued funding to expand and enhance the IPUMS Health Surveys Project.\nIPUMS Health Surveys provides streamlined access to core U.S. survey data on population health through\ntwo integrated databases: the National Health Interview Survey (IPUMS NHIS) and the Medical Expenditure\nPanel Survey Household Component (IPUMS MEPS). The NHIS is the leading source of information on U.S.\nhealth, health disparities, and the social determinants of health; the MEPS is the primary source of information\non national trends and correlates in health care spending and health systems change. The proposed project will\nfurther improve this crucial resource for pathbreaking research in four ways: (1) Expand the database. We will\nintegrate data and documentation from five new years of NHIS (2024-2028) and MEPS (2023-2027), nearly\ndoubling the number of MEPS variables we offer. (2) Lower the barriers to cutting-edge research. We will enable\nrigorous and reproducible research by creating several complex variables critical for answering urgent population\nhealth questions, including (a) the addition of MEPS family interrelationship variables to allow users to easily\nattach information across records (e.g., parent to child, spouse to spouse); (b) harmonization of NHIS occupation\nand industry information to support research on occupational health; (c) creating summary measures of health\ninsurance coverage instability over the course of the full MEPS panel; (d) bridging the substantial break between\nICD-9 and ICD-10 condition codes and creating simplified, policy-relevant categories to support analyses of\ncondition-specific health care expenditures using MEPS; (e) creating simplified MEPS prescribed medicines\nvariables so users can quickly identify broad categories of policy-relevant variables (e.g., generics, opioids); and\n(f) improving the prescription medication data. (3) Enhance data access. We will enhance data access tools in\nfive ways: (a) enabling researchers to incorporate additional information (e.g., reason for visit, type of medical\nprovider seen) in the variables created through the MEPS variable construction system; (b) developing the\ncapability for users to easily create and download custom MEPS variables that summarize the complex\nprescribed medicines data; (c) allowing extracts through the data access system with person-level data attached\nto event- and condition-level records; (d) enabling analysis of customized datasets using our online data analysis\nsystem; and (e) further simplifying access to user-defined summary variables by making them accessible through\nour data extract Application Programming Interface (API). (4) Disseminate data to a broad, diverse spectrum of\nusers. We will engage in user support, training, and outreach activities to attract new users and support current\nusers. Activities will include conference exhibits, presentations, introductory workshops, virtual office hours,\ntimely answers to user queries, and webinars. We will also offer a three-day, in-person MEPS training workshop\ngeared towards early-career scholars and scholars from historically underrepresented backgrounds.",

    "abstract_text": "Pitch plays a fundamental role in auditory and speech perception. In music it defines melody and harmony; in\nspeech it carries prosodic and (in tone languages) lexical information; and in everyday complex acoustic\nenvironments it plays a critical role in helping us to segregate and hear out important sounds against a\nbackground of other sounds. Despite its importance, fundamental questions surrounding how pitch is perceived\nand neurally encoded remain unanswered. There is, for instance, no consensus on how and why pitch accuracy\ndegrades with hearing loss and/or age. Similarly, despite cochlear implants\u2019 many successes, pitch remains very\npoorly conveyed for reasons that remain a matter of debate. This project combines behavioral studies in normal-\nhearing and hearing-impaired adults across the lifespan (Aim 1), behavioral and EEG studies in infants (Aim 2),\nand high-resolution neuroimaging (fMRI) studies in adults (Aim 3) with computational modeling to answer a\ncohesive set of fundamental questions on how pitch is perceived and represented. These questions include\nwhether peripheral or more central (experienced-based) factors lead to the dominance of low-numbered\nharmonics in everyday pitch perception (Aims 1 and 2), and whether the interactions between the perceptual\ndimensions of pitch (based on fundamental frequency) and brightness (based on spectral centroid) follow a\ndevelopmental trajectory that is also reflected in their cortical representations (Aims 2 and 3). The first two\nexperiments of Aim 1 (Exp. 1A/B) use individual differences to determine the effects of age and hearing loss on\nthe accuracy of pitch perception. They test the hypotheses that the sharp transition between good and poor pitch\ndiscrimination as lower harmonics are progressively removed is due to the limits of auditory filtering, as\ninfluenced by cochlear hearing loss, and that overall pitch fidelity across all conditions is degraded by age, as\nexpected from age-related cochlear synaptopathy. Aim 1\u2019s third experiment (Exp. 1C) utilizes recent signal-\nprocessing developments to test the role of harmonicity of either the target or interfering speech in the perceptual\nsegregation of competing talkers. Aim 2 uses a developmental approach to test whether properties that are\ncurrently believed to be innate, including interference between pitch and brightness (Exp. 2A/B), and poor\naccuracy at high harmonic numbers and/or frequencies (Exp. 2C/D), are in fact centrally mediated developmental\ntraits that emerge after extensive exposure to natural sounds. Finally, Aim 3 uses ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI to\ndetermine whether the perceptual interference observed in adults between pitch and brightness is reflected by\ninterdependence of cortical tuning (Exp. 3A); whether cortical mapping of pitch and frequency is affected by the\ncontext in which the tones are presented (Exp. 3B); and whether cortical correlates of pitch interval size and\ndirection can be observed (Exp. 3C). By improving our fundamental understanding of the neural coding and\nperception of pitch, we will be better placed to improve its representation in people with hearing loss and cochlear\nimplants.",

This project aims to test a novel graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen that could\nalso prevent malignant relapse. Our novel regimen accomplishes this goal by eliminating mycophenolate\nmofetil (MMF) from a post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and sirolimus (SIR)-based regimen, and\ninstead adding a novel, oral Aurora kinase A inhibitor that not only constrains GVHD through CD28 signal\ntransduction blockade but also provide direct anti-tumor effects. Elimination of both MMF and tacrolimus (TAC)\nfrom our proposed regimen enhances graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects, further contributing to relapse\nmitigation. We propose to compare our GVHD prophylaxis regimen of PTCy/SIR/VIC-1911 to the widely used\nPTCy/SIR/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) regimen in a randomized, phase II clinical trial in adults with\nhematologic malignancies undergoing myeloablative alloHCT. We hypothesize that substitution of VIC-1911 for\nMMF will result in a significantly better 1-year graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS),\nsetting a new standard in the field. Preclinical and phase I human data from the University of Minnesota show\nsignificant promise in the combined PTCy/SIR/VIC regimen, with low rates of acute/chronic GVHD and relapse,\nwhile not adding significant patient burden or side effects to the GVHD prophylaxis regimen. Partnering with\nthe Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) will provide a robust platform for trial\nimplementation, capitalizing on their expertise, multicenter collaborative infrastructure, and access to a large\nand diverse patient population, ensuring rigorous evaluation of our innovative regimen and its transformative\npotential in the field of alloHCT. The University of Minnesota unequivocally affirms its commitment to the BMT\nCTN, bringing its expertise and institutional resources to further enhance its mission and objectives through\nclinical trials such as the one we propose herein.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nThe grant \u201cTR2 nuclear receptor in vitamin A signaling\u201d (since 08/01/99) was initiated from studying retinoic\nacid (RA) signaling using an embryonic stem cell-specific orphan receptor TR2\u2019s (NR2C1) as a model to\nunderstand RA\u2019s action in developmental regulation. The long-term goal is to comprehensively understand RA\nsignaling pathways in health and diseases. Results first established RA\u2019s activity in chromatin-remodeling via\nRA receptors (RARs), Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and TR2. In 2008, we reported a then-mysterious effect of\nRA that did not involve RAR/RXR - it occurred rapidly in the cytoplasm to modulate ERK signaling, and thus\nwas proposed as \u201cnon-canonical\u201d. Previous proposal (05/1/2017-04/30/2022) aimed to i) identify the mediator\nof this non-canonical activity of RA in modulating ERK signaling and synthetic RA-like ligands specific to this\npathway, and ii) determine the physiological relevance. Results (published in 14 papers) have established\nCellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein 1 (CRABP1) as the mediator, characterized RA-CRABP1-RAF-MEK-\nERK signaling pathway and CRABP1 ligands specific to this pathway, and revealed physiological relevance in\nmaintaining neuron stem cell pool, adiposity and inflammation, all involving CRABP1-ERK regulation. Recently,\na second signaling pathway also directly modulated by CRABP1 was uncovered, calcium/calmodulin-\ndependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), but in a different physiological context - excitable cells requiring tight\nregulation of CaMKII such as motor neurons (MNs) and cardiomyocytes. The principal hypothesis is, RA-\nCRABP1 signalosomes form in specific cellular environments to provide timely (rapid) modulatory\nmechanisms ensuring homeostatic propagation of intracellular signals that are critical to the\nsurvival/function of the cells. Pertinent to CRABP1-CaMKII, our recent data show that CRABP1 is highly\nexpressed in MNs, and CRABP1 knockout (CKO) mice spontaneously develop age-dependent motor deficit\nresembling motor symptoms of MN degenerative disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), preceded by\nmorphological, structural, and functional deterioration of MNs and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). We thus\nengineered a sequenced MN-muscle co-differentiation system on custom-fabricated Hydrogel to generate an\nin vitro, functional 3D NMJ model for molecular studies. Two aims are to i) dissect molecular mechanisms\nof RA-CRABP1-CaMKII signalsome action in NMJ and identify CRABP1 ligands specific to this\npathway, and ii) determine the physiological action of RA-CRABP1-CaMKII signaling and its disease\nrelevance/therapeutic applications. Aim 1 will employ engineered 3D NMJ model to dissect physiologically\nrelevant signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms. Aim 2 will distinguish \u201cnon-canonical\u201d from\n\u201ccanonical\u201d activity of RA by comparing CRABP1 ligands and RA in maintaining healthy NMJs, and determine\nthe therapeutic potential of targeting CRABP1 to improve motor function.",

Genetically modified mice have been vital tools for cancer \nstudies for many years, enabling researchers to determine the roles of specific genes in cancer-relevant traits \nsuch as immune evasion, tumor initiation, and metastasis. MGL meets this need through the following specific \naims: 1) Produce transgenic and knockout mice, 2) Cryopreserve mouse sperm and embryos, 3) Assist with \nmouse embryo manipulation, and 4) Provide scientific consultation and specialized services. \nThese services provide MCC members convenient, cost-effective access to genetically modified mice. Access \nto these mice and associated technologies is critical to the ongoing work of MCC, particularly to members of \nthe Genetic Mechanisms, Immunology, and Cellular Mechanisms Programs. \nMGL is led by Dr. Timothy Hallstrom, who has 15 years of experience with mouse genetics research. He is the \nPI of a research laboratory focused on the cellular mechanisms controlling the retinoblastoma protein. Day-to- \nday operations of MGL are managed by Yun You, PhD, who also educates users of the laboratory on policies, \nprotocols, and maintenance of transgenic mouse strains. \nDuring the current period of support, MGL was able to rapidly respond to investigators\u2019 needs during the \nCOVID-19 outbreak by processing many different lines for sperm cryopreservation. We introduced a new \nservice that allows 2-cell embryos to be frozen for later rederivation. This circumvents the usual need for \nsometimes complex breeding encountered after standard frozen embryo derivation. We have also worked with \nthe Genome Engineering Shared Resource to significantly improve the efficacy of CRISPR with large DNA \nconstructs by using adeno-associated virus for CRISPR delivery of large insertions (~4.5 kb). \nServices offered internally by MGL are often more cost-effective and efficient than using external providers. \nMGL is supported by the University as well as CCSG funds, and MCC members are given priority over other \nusers.

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nImmunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that engage a specific antigen and trigger immune\neffector cell (IEC) activity has transformed cancer therapy. This application focuses on the development and\nclinical implementation of engineered T-regulatory (Treg) and NK cells due to their potent tumoricidal activity\nwith no risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The central hypothesis of this P01 s that allogeneic IECs\n(Tregs and NK cells) can be engineered to maximize tumor killing with fewer risks including undesirable on-\ntarget/off-tumor adverse events. Toward achieving the goals of the three Projects, Core D will provide the\nmolecular tools and analytics crucial for optimizing the genetic engineering platforms and examining the cell\nproducts to maximize safety prior to testing in the proposed clinical trials. In addition, Core D will provide umbilical\ncord blood (UCB) Tregs and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived induced CD8+ Tregs (iPSC- iTreg) for\nthe studies outlined in Projects 1 and 2 in particular and Project 3 for comparative studies. The Core will perform\nmolecular analyses of gene edited cell products and cell lines as a quality control. The Core integrates leading\nedge genetic constructs and proteins for engineering IECs with enhanced therapeutic properties as an off-the-\nshelf product for widespread and urgent use. Core D will produce lentiviral and adeno-associated virus (AAV)\nserotype 6 vectors that will be used to introduce/overexpress novel immune therapy genes in Treg, NK, and\niPSC to enhance tumor eradication. Luciferase lentiviruses will be used to generate cells that can be imaged in\nvitro/vivo to track IECs or tumor killing over time in all three Projects. The clustered regularly interspaced\npalindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing platform allows for target gene disruption, user defined\nmodification (i.e., incorporation of novel exogenous sequences), and transcriptome modulation. CRISPR/Cas9\nwill be employed in each project for enhancing IEC activity through deletion of target genes, introduction of\nimmune therapy candidates into user defined genomic loci, and upregulation of specific gene(s) that regulate\nimmune responses. Core D will also serve as the hub for distributing nanobody proteins and cellular products\nto the Project Leaders. Nanobodies that have high affinity to leukemia antigens will be provided to the project\nand program leaders for application in IECs for the Projects\u2019. This will inform project leaders as to how to best\nimplement or modify Treg and NK cell immunotherapeutic interventions. Uniform, high-quality reagents and data\ngenerated in these studies will be integrated with clinical outcomes in collaboration with Cores A, B, and C, and\nwill be made available to all three projects in order to maximize synergy and limit variation generated by having\ndifferent laboratories generate molecular tools for each individual project(s).",

    "abstract_text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by increased vascular permeability, decreased\nlung compliance, massive atelectasis and loss of aerated tissue, which often leads to respiratory failure and 40%\nmortality. Effective treatments for ARDS have become even more necessary as ARDS in non-survivors of Covid-\n19 may be as high as 90%. LS plays two key roles in healthy respiration: (1) it establishes a minimum surface\ntension \ud835\udefe!\"#~15 mN/m, and (2) it prevents the lung from collapsing due to the Laplace Instability, by ensuring\n2\ud835\udc38\u2217(\ud835\udf14) > \ud835\udefe, where \ud835\udc38\u2217(\ud835\udf14) = \ud835\udc34(\ud835\udf14)(\ud835\udf15\ud835\udefe\u2044\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc34) is the dilatational modulus, which describes the change in \ud835\udefe with\ninterfacial area, \ud835\udc34 at a breathing frequency \ud835\udf14. Lung lavage of ARDS patients shows decreased concentrations\nof lung surfactant and increased concentrations of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), fatty acids and lysolipids (LPC).\nPLA2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of double-chain phospholipids in pathogen membranes into insoluble fatty acid\nand soluble single-chain LPC that accumulates in the alveolar fluids. Notably, LPC forms micelles at exceedingly\nlow micromolar (\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc40) critical micelle concentrations (CMC). By incorporating otherwise insoluble LS molecules,\nLPC micelles can effectively \u201cscrub\u201d lung surfactant (LS) from the alveolar interface. By replacing LS at the\ninterface with LPC, \ud835\udefe!\"# increases from ~ 15 to ~ 40 mN/m; moreover, the dilatational modulus decreases so\nthat 2\ud835\udc38\u2217(\ud835\udf14) < \ud835\udefe, triggering the Laplace instability. Injured or inflamed areas with LPC concentration above CMC\nare thus susceptible to lung instability, decreased compliance and alveolar flooding as observed in ARDS.\nMoreover, replacement surfactants would suffer the same fate so long as LPC concentrations are above the\nCMC. In Aim 1, we will characterize how lysolipid micelles solubilize LS using dynamic light scattering as well\nas by adsorption to alveolar sized bubbles in the capillary pressure microtensiometer (CPM) built for this project.\nWe will examine shorter and longer chain lysolipids with choline, ethanolamine or anionic glycerol headgroups\nto correlate lysolipid CMC with \ud835\udefe and \ud835\udc38\u2217(\ud835\udf14). This hypothesis suggests that decreasing the LPC concentration in\nthe alveolar fluids below the CMC may be key to successful ARDS therapeutics. Adsorption of LPC into protein-\nfree liposomes that do not adsorb to the air-water interface can reduce the LPC below the CMC. Co-administered\nsynthetic lung surfactants containing the LS protein SP-B or peptide mimics of SP-B we developed, adsorb\nrapidly to the air-water interface to replace LPC at the interface. In Aim 2, we will examine the coupling between\nmonolayer domain morphology and interfacial curvature. Monolayer collapse determines the minimum surface\ntension and is fundamentally different on curved surfaces compared to the flat surface of the Langmuir trough.\nWe will use new experimental and theoretical techniques to measure line tension, dipole density difference, and\nthe Young\u2019s modulus of LS monolayers to quantify how monolayers bend or fold at collapse and describe the\neffects of interfacial curvature. These first of their kind experiments and theory should determine an optimal lung\nsurfactant composition resistant to LPC adsorption and provide a new way of stabilizing the ARDS lung.",

The proposal requests continuation of a training program at the Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota, continuously supported by the National Institute of Mental Health since 1959. In 1981 this training program added postdoctoral students and now consists of 3 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral positions. The award-winning faculty on the training grant reflect various sub- disciplines of developmental science, including child clinical psychology, developmental behavioral neuroscience/developmental psychobiology, stress neurobiology, socioemotional development, pediatrics, and intervention science. External training faculty from other departments across the University of Minnesota (e.g., Family Social Science, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Psychology, Pharmacology, Public Health) also will serve as co-mentors of the pre- and \u2013post doctoral trainees. This allows our trainees to take advantage of the full richness of research in developmental psychopathology available at the University of Minnesota. In any given year, the predoctoral trainees represent approximately 10% of all Ph.D. students in the Institute of Child Development; thus, being placed on the training grant is highly competitive. Students enter the training grant as 2nd, 3rd or 4th year Ph.D. students (preferentially 3rd or 4th year) so that we can be more confident of their talent and of their commitment to research areas pertinent to NIMH\u2019s strategic goals. Postdoctoral trainees are selected based on evidence of research potential, strong recommendations, and fit with the program. Predoctoral trainees complete one of two Ph.D. tracks, the Developmental Science track or the Developmental Psychopathology Clinical Science track; the latter involves a one-year clinical internship. All predoctoral trainees receive training in professional development, ethics in research, statistics, and cognitive and social development as part of the larger Ph.D. program. T32 trainees in addition take a course in developmental psychopathology, attend the annual research ethnic UMN conference, present at the annual clinical research day and complete grant-writing training. Postdoctoral students complete the grant writing training and, in consultation with their faculty mentor and the training grant director, any areas of developmental science that are critical to their research program and in which they lacked sufficient prior training.",

Yet, even as the\ndisease burden increases, the number of investigators committed to finding ways to prevent and treat\nmetabolic diseases has lagged persistently behind. The University of Minnesota (UMN) has held a T32 training\ngrant since 1977 with demonstrated success. Within the last 10 years (n=13 trainees), 10 (77%) are in\nresearch related fields, 5 (38.4%) are Assistant Professors, and 7 (54%) are associated with NIH grants (either\nPI or Co-I). To drive the success of the T32 training program moving forward, we have assembled an\noutstanding, complementary leadership team (MPI between Drs Chow and Bernlohr) and sharpened the\ncurrent proposal\u2019s focus to leverage the recent flourishing success of UMN investigators in metabolic\nhealthspan, the preservation of metabolic health. The proposed T32 program will provide advanced training in\nstate-of-the-art research focused on the mechanisms affecting metabolic healthspan and enhancing metabolic\nhealth. To achieve this goal, we will employ a multifaceted approach inspired by our past history to train four\npostdoctoral students (MD, PhD or MD/PhD) per year for up to 2 years per trainee. The training approach\nincludes the following: #1 Provide trainees with the skill sets necessary to perform multidisciplinary research\nregarding metabolic healthspan, #2 Provide high quality mentorship, now involving Senior/Associate Mentors\n(mentor dyads) to support trainee and Associate Mentor development, #3 Provide an outstanding environment\nfusing research and clinical training for physician and PhD trainees, #4 Provide skill development, including the\nexperience of writing a F32 or alternative career development grant during the second year, for trainees to\nthrive in academic medicine and #5 Establish programs that enhance recruitment and retention of diverse\ntrainees. The overarching objective of the proposed UMN T32 program is to train physicians and scientists for\nresearch careers focused on enhancing metabolic healthspan while providing a thoughtfully-designed training\nenvironment focused on meeting the unique development needs of postdoctoral fellows as they define their\ncareer and research goals.",
